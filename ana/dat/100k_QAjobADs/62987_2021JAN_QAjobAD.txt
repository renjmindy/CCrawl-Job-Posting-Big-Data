 You can tout your certification on your resume and LinkedIn profile, and leverage your knowledge and accomplishment as you seek a position or promotion. If you don’t pass the exam, you can attempt it two more times within the year, which may come with additional fees. Check out this helpful  Certification FAQ page  for more details. 
 Step 5: Maintain your certification 
 Both certifications require holders to maintain them in different ways. 
 You must pass the CAPM every five years to maintain your certification. The CAPM exam changes periodically, so it’s important to prepare well each time. 
 PMP certification requires you to complete 60 professional development units (PDUs) each year to maintain your certification. There are many ways to earn PDUs, including in-person and online courses, giving presentations related to your certification, and even volunteering your services to certain organizations. 
 In both paths to becoming a project manager, you’re continuously learning, avoiding stagnation, and keeping up in a dynamic field.
