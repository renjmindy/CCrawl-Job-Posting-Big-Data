 Certification program student profile 
 The program has a minimum age requirement to enroll — prospective students must be at least 21 years old — and they must meet all the requirements from the state of Illinois to be eligible for a dispensary agent card. And because it’s a certificate program for which students can earn college credit, the credits can count towards an associate degree and can be transferable for a bachelor’s degree at a four-year university. 
 “There are individuals in the class with master’s degrees and other degrees who are very interested in pursuing work, business or to collaborate with the cannabis industry. There are those who have high school diplomas as well. There diversity of backgrounds, their reasons for pursuing the certificate are present. It brings a really nice dynamic to the classroom,” says Melissa Mendoza, program chair and professor in Oakton’s physical therapy assistant program. 
 An industry with job and career potential 
 Student Pam Lefkowitz has worked in information technology for 25 years. She owns  her own consulting firm  and says slower-than-preferred business activity led her to the program. 
 “I went back to school at Oakton with the intention of getting one of the certificates in accounting. I was contemplating working for the IRS,” Lefkowitz says. “In June, Governor JB Pritzker  expanded the conditions  that were eligible for medical marijuana cards in the state. When I was looking for the site to apply for a card, the link for the program at Oakton popped to the top of my list. I won't lie, I was stunned. I immediately went and logged in to my account to register for the program.”
