 Qualifications 
 Applicants must have successfully completed the WAG Nutrition Coach Certification in order to be considered for a coaching position. Click  HERE  to join the presale list for our next launch! 
 We love applicants that have book smarts, aka major bonus points if you really know your stuff and have a degree in some form of health science or fitness. 
 We require applicants to have "WAG smarts". In other words, you  must  go through the WAG program as a client if you haven't already. Complete the minimum 3 month requirement by clicking  HERE . 
 We know what you're thinking -- why all the rules, WAG? The answer is simple: We want our future coaches to be the most studied and practiced out there, so they can give professional advice from an academic standpoint while also drawing from the relatable experience of having once been in their client's shoes. 
 Thank you for thinking of WAG!
