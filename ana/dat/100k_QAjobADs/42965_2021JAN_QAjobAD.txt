 # Jobs 
 When an active recipe processes a trigger event and runs the sequence of actions, as defined in the recipe logic, it creates a  job . Each job holds a unique trigger event and executes its recipe logic based on that data (e.g. running  If..Then  action based on the availability of the data). 
 Workato provides complete details into the execution flow of a job, i.e. what steps were executed, and the data input and output from every step. Workato also supports rerunning of jobs, in cases whereby an error stops a job from full completion.
