 How Does Certification Work? 
 Each program or school may vary slightly in terms of timeline, but once you finish your coursework, you’ll be able to get your Trainee License. This license allows you to participate in your externship. 
 After completing a clinical externship, you’ll be able to take Pharmacy Technician Certification Exam (PTCE) administered through the Pharmacy Technician Certification Board (PTCB). Of course, it’s always a  good idea  to look into specific requirements in the state you plan to go to school and/or work in.
