 Certifications 
 There are roles that require certifications. You may have had to put these on the back burner because life and work were busy enough. If you are thinking about moving the pursuit of a certification to the front burner, LinkedIn has a variety of certification prep courses. As well, the organizations that oversee the certifications have extensive information on how to complete their requirements including timelines and costs. 
 If you find yourself thinking about upgrading your skills, at the very least take some time to review what might be involved and invest some effort into your career development â€“ you deserve it.
