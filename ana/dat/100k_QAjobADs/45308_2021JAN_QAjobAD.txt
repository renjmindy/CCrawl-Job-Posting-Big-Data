 Do You Require Any Certifications? 
 Having an educational degree is not enough to land a job as a speech therapist. You must also be certified as one. After obtaining your degree, you should enroll yourself in a clinical fellowship training program, then pass the Certificate of Clinical Competence in Speech-Language Pathology (CCC-SLP) held by ASHA. As different states may have different laws, you may also have to acquire additional certifications as required by the state of your domicile. 
 Do You Require Any License? 
 Depending upon your state of residence, you may be required to obtain a license before you can work as a speech therapist. Beside your educational qualifications, you need to have the ASHA-accredited CCC-SLP to obtain a license in most states. Some states also accept the equivalent Canadian certification provided by the Canadian Association of Speech-Language Pathologists and Audiologists (CASLPA). There are different levels of licenses and you will have to pass the required examination for each level to be able to practice your trade. 
 Why Choose This Career? 
 As a speech therapist, you will have employment opportunities in private practices, hospitals, clinics, schools, rehabilitation centers, care facilities, federal government agencies, local government health departments, long-term care facilities and other healthcare agencies. Most speech therapists are employed by private practices. You may also start your own practice if you are up to it. In the USA, the median annual income of a qualified speech therapist is between $53,000 and $65,000. However, the top speech therapists can make upwards of $80,000 annually, which makes it a lucrative career, indeed.
