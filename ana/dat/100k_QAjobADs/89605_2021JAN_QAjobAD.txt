 Consider Getting Certification 
 Google, HubSpot, Lynda, and other online training centres offer certificates in writing specialties like Inbound Marketing, Social Media, Email Marketing, and other writing-specific skills. Not all writing jobs require certification, but choosing a specialty and getting specialized training may help you connect with jobs that pay a higher rate than ordinary writing jobs. 
 Beware of certificates that aren’t from recognized, reputable sources, or that cost a lot of money; some certification courses are scams. Look for companies with widely recognized training, and brand names that have a good reputation. 
 Sign up on a Freelance Writing Website 
 There are a lot of online freelancer platforms. Your most difficult task may be choosing one, so read the blogs and testimonials of people who have used the sites. None of these platforms are perfect, and everyone has negative experiences sometimes, but look for a platform with lots of jobs, a good diversity of clients, and reasonable average rates. 
 You may want to sign up for all of them at once, but that’s not a good approach to begin with. It’s best to sign up with one at first and get very familiar with it. Use any training or support that they offer, read the FAQ’s and forums, and spend some time creating a good profile for yourself on the site.
