 Earn The Certification 
 The major issue you will need to cover is the certification process. And best of all, there are multiple methods for going through this certification process, which depend on the schools, districts, and states. These types are still dependent upon what level or grade you will be teaching for, which is why it’s important to decide the grade ahead of time. Those levels are Early Childhood (Kindergarten to 3rd grade), Elementary (Kindergarten to 6th grade), Middle Grades (5th Grade to 9th Grade), and Secondary teaching (7th grade to 12th grade). Secondary teaching always requires an endorsement which is usually covered based on your degree but if you have an obscure degree you might have to take an exam to meet the endorsement. 
 The Traditional Certification Route:  Depending upon your state this method will often require taking a class or multiple classes, going through student teaching experiences, and/or passing an exam. In most cases, it will be a combination of all three, but some states will waive classes if you have a Masters or higher degree. You’ll want to check your state’s department of education teaching requirements to make sure of what you need before you start the process. 
 The Emergency Certification Route:  In cases of schools or states that are in critical need of teachers, they will actually offer critical need certificates, which is handled by the school, but will generally only last for five years. During that time you are required to get a traditional certification. This emergency certification is also used for teachers who are certified in one state but not another. For more information, contact your state department of education. 
 Private School Certification Route:  In most states private or charter schools will handle their own standards for hiring teachers, and not all of them even require a teaching certification. In this case you will have to contact the private school in question to see what their standards are and whether they require traditional teacher certification.

 Finally, almost every job is different in requirements for the skills and sometimes going from a desk accounting job to a teacher in math can be difficult to figure out what skills actually transfer over, other than an understanding of math. When determining your resume, focus on areas like: 
 What kind of communication skills you have
