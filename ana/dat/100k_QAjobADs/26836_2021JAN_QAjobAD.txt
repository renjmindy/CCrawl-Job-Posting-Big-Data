 Qualifications: 
Secretarial/clerical applicants require a grade 12 diploma and several years of related experience. Library Technician positions require a Library and Information Technician Diploma plus related experience. 
 Criminal Record Check: 
For the safety of students, successful candidates will be required to submit a satisfactory criminal record check prior to the commencement of any employment duties. Recent changes made by the RCMP have resulted in significant processing delays for some candidates. You may wish to start the process to obtain your criminal record check as soon as possible.

The Peel District School Board is committed to equity in employment. We are committed to equitable hiring practices that allow us to hire qualified staff who reflect the full diversity of the Region of Peel.
