 Do They Pay for Certifications, Degrees, etc.? 
 Many companies pay for college credit for their employees. This is how a lot of people are able to earn advanced degrees without going into debt. Ask if the company has a policy and how you can be eligible for it. Even if they don’t offer to pay for your degree, see if they will cover the cost of  continuing education , conferences and special seminars. 
 What Are the Options for Health Insurance? 
 The cost for  health insurance  can differ greatly based on deductibles, copays, coinsurance, premiums, and coverage for spouses and dependents. Seeing the hard numbers for all the available plans can make it easier to compare it to your current coverage. Don’t be afraid to contact the insurance company to see if your current providers will be accepted. 
 How Do They Review Employees? 
 One of the biggest ways a good job can turn sour is if you aren’t sure how you can succeed. Some companies have set guidelines for performance reviews, while others offer feedback on a regular basis. Find out how you will be evaluated, if pay is tied to performance and how often reviews will occur.
