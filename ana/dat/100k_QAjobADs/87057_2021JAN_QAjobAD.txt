 Slime-free Career Networking 
 Networking got a bad name because too many people saw it as transactional: I'm going to use you/you're going to use me/let's hope I can get a better deal on this trade than you do. That approach can have kind of a "meat" market, last-call-at-a-singles-bar flavor, and fear of getting caught in that flavor is one reason many women work late at their computers instead of going to an event where they might actually meet someone who would be good to know. On the other hand, if you meet someone you might want to do business with and don't acknowledge that's what you want, even to yourself, you close off any possibility that something good could happen. 
 What to do? When you meet someone at a business function, whether it be an industry group or women's conference, that person is a prospect, and it's okay to think of him or her that way . . . it's even expected. If you meet the person somewhere else and you're not sure if he or she would like to be seen as a prospect, you can do a quick qualifier and see how the response. If you say, for example, "Oh, I sell beauty products" to someone who owns a beauty salon, and she says, "What do you think of these appetizers?" you know that she might want to be your friend but not on your call list.

 Blue Collar Job Search 
 A lot of what I've written about in the past has been for professionals and executives, but I had an experience recently that made me think about a blue collar job search, and what the differences are. This is pretty interesting because most of the job search blogs I follow seem to be written for a white collar professional. 
 I don't want to draw any lines and declare that blue collar is better, or worse, than white collar. I simply want to talk about some of the nuances of a blue collar job search, compared to a white collar job search.

 Seven Smart Career Networking Moves Guaranteed To Make You More Memorable 
 It's a fact: employers prefer to hire people they know over "mystery" candidates. That's why networking accounts for how 64 percent of people find jobs, while only 11 percent find work through advertisements (New York Times survey). Conferences, trade shows, meetings, and small-group gatherings are excellent venues for being visible, getting connected, and becoming known to the people who have the power to hire. Here are seven "Cs" for making the most of networking events. 
 1. Catalog your strengths, value, and vision.  Know who you are and what you want. What are your greatest strengths? Convert those strengths into value. Think in terms of return-on-investment (ROI) how would you describe your ROI were an employer to ask, "What can you do for us?" Finally, envision. As Stephen Covey says, "Begin with the end in mind." What opportunities are you targeting? What skills do you want to use that would tap into your tingle factor?

 Are You Pressing Your Recruiter's Hot Button? 
 Many of you have had unique experiences working with recruiters during a job hunt. Some good and some not so good. Like every profession, there are "good people" and then there are others. You need to do your own homework to ensure you are working with a reputable recruiter. At the same time, you need to do what is expected of you to avoid harming your chances to land a job they are working on. After all, they hold the keys to the opportunity. It is essential for you to have a great working relationship. 
 With this in mind, I recently polled my recruiter community to find out their top "pet peeves" about working with candidates. I know you have you own list for them, but theirs is a good one to read to ensure you are a stand-out candidate. I have included their  Twitter  name so you can ask them follow-up questions if you like. This is a smart and reputable bunch. Heed their advice and you'll be glad you did!

 Unusual Job Seeker Tactics That Worked 
 Even as the job market slowly improves, unemployment still continues to be high, which means competition for open positions remains tough in many areas. 
 CareerBuilder’s annual survey about unusual tactics came out recently and it turns out more and more job seekers are trying everything and anything to stand out from their competitors. Twenty-two percent of hiring managers reported that, compared to last year, they are seeing more job seekers try unusual tactics to capture their attention. This is up from 18 percent who said the same in 2009 and 12 percent in 2008.

 Taking Networking to the Next Level: Getting Your Name Out There - Have you ever Googled yourself? 
 You know… have you entered your name into the well-known Internet Google search engine to see how many times your name appears on the Web. To get a fairly accurate reading of how often your name appears, place it in quotation marks in Google, e.g., "Katharine Hansen." If you have a very common name, add some other identifying information, such as the town you live in or your employer, e.g., "Katharine Hansen" "DeLand, FL" "The Career Guide." 
 What does this little exercise have to do with networking? Even if you've never Googled yourself, it's possible that an employer or recruiter has. It's part of an emerging practice especially at senior and executive levels to find out how visible a prospective employee is. The number of citations or "hits" on Google is considered a reasonable gauge of a candidate's visibility.
