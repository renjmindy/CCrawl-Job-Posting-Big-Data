 Certifications and Buzzwords 
 If you have a certification or training that pertains to IT, security, audit, project management, etc., explain how you used that in your job. For example, what projects did you apply your Lean Six Sigma skills? What were the results? “Reduced errors by 30%”, etc. 
 Likewise, get other IT Audit buzzwords in your profile by giving examples of things you did. If you ever reviewed who had access to a system or folder, list that. If you developed a policy, name a couple of them. What standards and best practices? What exceptions? How did you ensure compliance? 
 Get those buzzwords in your profile by answering those kind of questions, but keep it short and sweet as possible. Sometimes you can’t do that, but that’s OK here and there. 
 Fix Typos and Acronyms 
 Fix typos. Have 2 other people read through your profile for errors, then fix them.
