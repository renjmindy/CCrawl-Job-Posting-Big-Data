 6. Social Media Manager 
 A social media manager is in charge of managing the social accounts of a company or multiple companies. They would manage the day-to-day activities such as content strategy, content creation, scheduling and implementation of posts and management and occasionally management of deliverables of designers and copywriters. With freelance social media managers, sometimes design & copywriting falls to them, and often cases businesses prefer this as it reduces costs and output time. Doing an online course in Photoshop would be beneficial.
