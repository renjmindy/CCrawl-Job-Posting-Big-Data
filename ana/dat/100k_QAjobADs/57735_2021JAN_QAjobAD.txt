 Living Income Guaranteed and Property Ownership 
 Posted on  July 3, 2013  Updated on  October 31, 2013 
 Living Income Guaranteed is particularly focused on those situations where a person is not in a position to have sufficient income to be able to participate as an equal within society through spending, purchasing, ensuring the basic needs required for a human to exist. There are conditions where a Living Income Guaranteed is not required meaning that those that have = do not qualify for a Living Income Guaranteed which is destined to ensure that there is enough income available to support those when in trouble, or when society is not yet able to produce sufficient jobs. 
 One of the foundations of capitalism is owning property, but also one of the foundations of capitalism is having a society that is able to consume because they have the means with which to do so, and this is why it is suggested that a balance must be struck. 
 The basic regulation would be that if you have more than one house you’re owning = you do not qualify for a Living Income Guaranteed because you are able – due to your property value – to sustain yourself or at the very least, you’ll have to sell one of the properties and then if you do not have employment, you’ll be able to qualify for a Living Income Guaranteed.

 Living Income Guaranteed and Pensions 
 Posted on  July 3, 2013  Updated on  October 31, 2013 
 Within a Living  Income Guaranteed  system the need for unemployment, insurance, benefits, pensions and life insurance no longer exists. The resources that are placed within the shareholding of the citizenry is what facilitates the Living Income Guaranteed and one qualifies for benefit from your shareholding when you are unemployed, when you are on pension or when you are in some way incapacitated and you cannot work – this implies that there is never a stage where one is without the necessary capital to actually sustain a living. 
 The industries that are currently profiting from all the misfortunes in a person’s life no longer need to exist because your Living Income Guaranteed facilitates all the points and ensures that no one is ever without capital when they’re unemployed or if you have been in an accident and you cannot work = you’ll still have an income; the same applies if you have a family and the bread owner dies, the family still has an income. All the points where insurance existed which has been the recipient where people has placed their money, has caused such major havoc in the world within the financial sector because this money then goes into the stock markets to mess with the world food prices and to come with the idea that apparently ‘there are ways to make money’ so it becomes part of the global market casino. The end of this casino is possible with Living Income Guaranteed, although other corporations will still probably want to benefit from it and have shareholding, that will still happen; but your shareholding will no longer be vested in major corporations or life insurance companies, it will be the individual that will invest through their bank – and the bank being one of their own businesses in which they have shares that will facilitate and manage the investment in the privately owned and financed corporations, so that the distribution of money and the management of the system becomes highly efficient. 
 All of this can be computerized with great simplicity as a mechanism that can be trusted once placed and tested. This is how we can reduce the problems coming from humans making mistakes, because with the machine and with software one can manage the distribution, the placement of investments a lot easier. So, a citizen can decide that they want to support a particular business and buy shares in it and then once there is a profit declared by that company, the citizen benefits from the profit through dividends – these dividends are tax free, because there is no personal tax and there is also no corporate tax – so one can use that to spend on luxury items and so, the cash flow of the economy increases, which means job creation increases which means there are more jobs available for people that want to earn a better living and not only exist with a Living Income Guaranteed, yet Living Income Guaranteed is sufficient to make a decent living.
