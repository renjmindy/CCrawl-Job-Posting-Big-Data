 Creating sections within your CV can help make it clear for the reader, but also jog your own memory of different experiences you have had (consider sections including  Qualifications and Diplomas, Education, Volunteer Experience, Apprenticeships, Awards  ) 
 Do make sure you have contact details on your application. 
 Don’t leave out email addresses, phone numbers or even LinkedIn pages (you’d be amazed how many people do this – ask someone to proof-read it for you too!) 
 Whether you are a recent graduate, a recent redundancy, a candidate struggling in this competitive market, please put any suggestions down below or questions you have so we can all help each other in this crazy time!
