 7. Not Having the Right Qualifications 
 Merely making the decision to change is not good enough. There may be a gap that needs to be bridged before you can successfully walk over to the other side. 
 Skills , qualifications, additional training and experience are often required before you can obtain a full-time job at an upper level in the hierarchy. 
 If an entry-level job is not what you are looking for, you might need to work as a temp,  volunteer , or intern to gain some experience. This will also enable you to test the waters before you actually decide to pursue a career in the field.

 Make sure you answer every question from every angle before you decide to move to another green pasture. Many people come to a point in life when they seriously consider a  career change .
