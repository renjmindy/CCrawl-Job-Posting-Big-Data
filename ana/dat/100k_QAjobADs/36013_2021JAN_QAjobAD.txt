 Some consider welding a science. You have to know how the metals and gases are going to react, what combinations to use to achieve the best results, and a multitude of other variables that affect your end results. Like most trades, it's possible move beyond what you’ve taught yourself or been taught. Certifications help you stand out in a crowd of applicants. **** 
 Welding Certifications  **** 
 What welding certifications are out there? If you’re not sure, we’re going to highlight a few of the most common ones for you here. It’s always best to check with the company you’re looking to work for before signing up for any classes or programs. Some businesses might call it good with a simple welding test, while others will prefer certifiable results. 
 The main components to any welder’s basic skill set include competent welding ability, of course, along with  proper safety training . Can you (a) weld and (b) be safe while doing it? Pass that first question and you’re on your way to the HR manager’s short list. While this may seem like a no-brainer, the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) says  most companies turn away up to 60% of their applicants  because they can’t meet these requirements. 
 Once you’ve checked off those skills, consider obtaining certifications relevant to the field you’re looking to get into. Most welders can  earn certifications within 9 months , according to GoWelding.org. However, the best place to start is the American Welding Society. 
 Unfortunately, there is no “ single welding certification that covers all types of welding .” Workers can be certified in many types of welding. Just because you can call yourself a “certified welder” doesn’t mean you’re necessarily qualified to perform all welding jobs. For example, you don’t need a doctorate to know CPR. However, if you’re operating in high-risk situations, more education is not only ideal—it’s often required. And for good reason.

 Many welding certifications expire after 6 months. If you’ve been practicing and using your skills on the job, the certification testing should be as simple as a day’s work. Just know that the results you deliver will most likely determine if that work continues or not. 
 Common Certifications and Cost 
 There is a trio of welding certifications that GoWelding.org recommends for newcomers. The certifications include an  AWS D1.1 3G and 4G SMAW combo, and a 3G MIG . Competency is key in welding, so having these 3 under your belt shows employers already that you’re serious about the trade. 
 With these tests come an associated cost. Many  vocational schools will offer certification testing, at varying prices . Sign up usually hovers around $200. Test plates are relatively cheap at about $20 apiece, with pipes costing students about $30 each. Cost of test pieces also depends directly upon the type of metal. Obviously, the better-quality metal starts at a higher price. GoWelding.org notes that vocational schools are a great place to take your welding certification tests because you can theoretically take as many tests as you want during the length of the class. You just have to pay for testing pieces. 
 Like with all things educational, it’s best to shop around and see what certifications schools near you are offering. Talk with the resident welders there. See what certifications they recommend. Welders who can be versatile in their abilities tend to earn much more than those qualified in just one skill. So, diversity is never a bad thing when you’re learning to weld—so long as you can demonstrate your competency in each area. 
 Next up, we’ll discuss 3 common career paths most welders take. For the undecided, this is a great starting point. We’ll give you an idea of what kind of money you can make and where you’ll likely be working. The decision ultimately lies with you. ****
