 Required Qualifications: 
High School Diploma, GED or equivalent experience (undergraduate degree preferred). 
1 year of experience in developing current and new customer relationships, achieving sales goals and building referral sources. Experience with sales is more important than financial services experience.

Interpersonal interaction skills and an ability to build rapport in matter of minutes is vital. 
Foundational knowledge of sales and service techniques with consumers and small businesses, including tele-consulting, outside calling, prospecting and networking. Comfort going out on business calls, overcoming objection, and asking fact-finding questions with the goal of being helpful.
