 David pursued training certificates in SCMC (South Carolina Manufacturing Certification) and CNC (Computer Numeric Controlled) Machine Operator. After attending an Open House at Tri-County Technical College, he was awarded a $2,000 Workforce Scholarship to cover the cost of his SCMC courses, and he received a WIOA scholarship which covered the cost of his CNC courses. 
 He completed the SCMC course at Tri-County Technical College in May of 2018 and obtained 10 certificates, including Manufacturing Standards Skills Council (MSSC), OSHA, Six Sigma, and Snap-On Tools. At the end of his class, Tri-County Tech connected students with employers and conducted on-site interviews. David was able to interview for a position at E&I Engineering and quickly gained employment as an EHRT Machinist. He began work immediately after completing his certification classes, earning a great wage. David continues to attend the CNC course that began in April of 2018 at TCTC, while maintaining full-time employment. He really enjoys his new job and hopes to continue to advance in the company.

 CREATING A BETTER CAREER 
 Meet Stephanie M. - 
 After meeting with a Career Coach to enroll in the WIOA program, Stephanie attended a Resume workshop and Interview workshop with a Workforce Consultant. She states this was very helpful in contributing to her success in finding employment. She met with her Career Coach and took a couple of different career interest inventories before finally settling on a goal of obtaining CNC Operator Certification training. She decided to take classes at Tri-County Technical College to obtain these skills, as her goal was to obtain employment as a machinist at Borg Warner. 
 She began CNC classes at TCTC on 12/5/2017 and attended 3 nights a week while working a full-time job. During the class, she became adept at CNC lathe operations, CNC mill overview, and measurement and gauging tools. She obtained a certification as a CNC Operator, in addition to certificates in NIMS (National Institute of Metalworking Skills) and OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration). Shortly after completing her class, she obtained full-time employment at Borg Warner as a CNC Machinist, earning a great wage to start, and has already received a raise!

 THE PRESCRIPTION FOR SUCCESS 
 Meet Dawn C. - 
 Dawn C.’s journey began with WIOA (Workforce Innovation Opportunity Act) in 2015, when she enrolled in the Patient Care Technician courses at Tri-County Technical College. She completed her CNA course, but could not continue with classes due to illness. However, she returned in the summer of 2017 seeking possible assistance and was able to find success. 
 She attended a WIOA orientation in late June 2017 and soon after completed the WIOA application with her Career Coach. She had already obtained WorkKeys previously, and she attended Resume and Interviewing Workshops, which were conducted by a Workforce Consultant. After some career planning, she decided that her heart was set on becoming a Phlebotomist. She pursued Phlebotomy Certification training at TCTC. Her training was approved and she began classes in August 2017. 
 Dawn received a scholarship through Tri-County Technical College, which covered the tuition for her classes. Funding from WIOA covered the cost of her pre-requisite courses, books, uniforms, immunizations, background check, and drug screen. Dawn excelled in her classes and was given glowing recommendations from her instructor. Her clinical was completed at Greenville Health System, where she was hired on as a Phlebotomist within several weeks. Her goal was to complete and exceed the minimum number of “sticks,” which she not only completed but doubled in a short amount of time. She is now gainfully employed at Oconee Memorial Hospital and is still keeping record of her number of sticks. She began working on November 27, 2017 and earns a sustainable wage. She is also currently receiving training in Electrocardiogram Certification through her employer. 
 Dawn received her Phlebotomy Certificate on December 6, 2017 and will be taking her exam in the coming weeks. She encourages many of her friends to explore their career options through SC Works and states, “If you do the legwork, SC Works & WIOA will help you get your foot in the door to your career.”
