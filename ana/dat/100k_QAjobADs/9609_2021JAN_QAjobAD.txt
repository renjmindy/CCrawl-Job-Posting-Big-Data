 I have earned a Bachelorâ€™s of Science Degree and my MBA from Franklin University in Columbus, Ohio. In addition to my education, I hold certifications as an Internal Conflict Coach (ICC), an SPHR from the Human Resource Certification Institute (HRCI) and a Professional Certified Coach (PCC) from the International Coach Federation (ICF). 
 After nearly 10 years with the American Red Cross, I joined SHRM as Regional Director and within 18 months was promoted to Chief Membership Officer, where I served as the chief promoter of global membership, member engagement, and retention initiatives. My work resulted in year over year revenue and membership growth during an economic recession and launched a demand for my speaking, training and facilitation expertise. 
 After a wonderful relationship with SHRM, my desire to enhance the leadership expertise of professionals in the business community grew stronger. With these goals in mind, I became a Business Strategist, Management Consultant and Executive Coach, where I now focus on helping business leaders avoid strategic drift and achieve business outcomes. Over the past 8 years I have applied Process Facilitation, Consultation, Coaching, Change Management, Team Building, Training and Development approaches to help clients achieve their organizational and professional goals.
