 Job Qualifications: 
 Experience is highly valued in these positions. The typical manager has worked in the mining or forestry industry for several years and has prior experience in a supervisory role. Education-wise, mining managers typically have a degree in mining engineering or earth sciences, and oil and gas managers typically have a degree in geology, earth sciences or petroleum engineering. 
 Salary: 
 Six-figure incomes are not uncommon for these positions, with median salaries currently topping $104,000. The field has seen some turmoil recently amid lower commodity prices, but salaries remain comparatively high. Operational managers help increase natural resource companies’ margins and make safety and environment improvements, so they’re better placed to weather downturns than entry-level workers . 
 Career Opportunity: 
 Job prospects vary depending on the field. Overall, a slight increase is anticipated over the next few years in mining and forestry. The former sector is expected to experience sharp growth courtesy a recent increase in exploration, which should continue to have a positive effect in the next few years, according to Statistics Canada. Job growth in the forestry industry should also increase slightly from a modest hike in demand for wood products.
