 Did I mention this was Practitioner season? After the first of three ‘Thursday to Sunday’ Practitioner Certification weekends, followed by two Breakthrough Coaching Sessions, I went directly to toasted … totally toasted! 
 So apologies if you've been looking for the follow-up to this decoding exercise and now … back to  Sam  and  Roger . And while there is bound to be a little lost in my translation of their stories, there are enough clues and insights to make the exercise worthwhile. 
 The words  Sam  and  Roger  used during our conversations provided enough unconscious clues to predict their default behaviours while working. 
 Sam  speaks of being confused, struggling, hands on, concrete, stuck, frustrated; his comfort with things and tangible tasks; and discomfort with ambiguity. 
 This language is a pretty good indication that he focuses on things rather than people or ideas, learns by doing and hands-on experience, and is currently in an unresourceful state (into his feelings) because of the absence of sensory based data. 
 Sam  also talks about managing processes, but not knowing how to get started, says show him what to do and he'll do it. My notes from our conversation included “needing to see my development, progress, completion of a project."
