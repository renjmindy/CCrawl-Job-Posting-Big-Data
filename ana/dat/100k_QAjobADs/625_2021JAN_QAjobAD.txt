 10 Jobs that Pay $70,000 Per Year 
 Still wondering if that college degree is worth the cost of tuition? A study from online salary database PayScale.com found that people who hold four-year college degrees will earn approximately 50 percent more than a high school grad over the course of their careers. 
 Even if you graduate with the average level of education debt -- about $21,000, according to The Project on Student Debt -- there are a range of jobs out there to help you pay it off before the term of the loan is up, if you’re diligent. 
 Want to know what makes people tick? Then there’s no better career than analyzing market research data for a business or an advertising agency. It’s a rapidly growing field, too, thanks to the competition between companies to grab market share in a tough economy. According to the BLS, demand for market and survey researchers is projected to grow 28 percent in the next few years, much faster than the average. Even better, there is no single path to entry into the field, though a business degree with a concentration in marketing is helpful. Likewise, earning a Professional Researcher Certification (PRC) from the Marketing Research Association can help you stand out from the competition. 
 Department Store Buyer  - $70,100 
 Who says retail is struggling? Recent market research suggests that consumers are less uptight about spending as the post-recession. Amid this optimism, the BLS indicated the outlook for the buying and purchasing job market will enjoy 7 percent growth as we head into the next decade. Becoming a buyer for a major retail outlet usually requires a bachelor's degree in business administration or other relevant area. Many senior-level execs began their careers as assistant buyers, but remember to turn your years of toil in a store into an asset as many entry-level jobs require general retail experience. 
 Regional Sales Manager  - $72,600 
 If you enjoy working with people and have a persuasive personality, you’re probably a natural salesperson. Add in organizational and managerial expertise and you can snag the big bucks. Years of sales experience in any industry often count as much as an undergraduate degree in this expanding field. The BLS indicates that sales and marketing managers and their departments constitute some of the most important personnel in an organization and are less subject to downsizing or outsourcing than are other types of managers. Though competition is keen, the BLS estimates the field to grow by 15 percent through 2018 and certification from the National Association of Sales Professionals can put you ahead of the pack. 
 Geologist  - $79,600

 Biggest CEO Bonuses for 2010 
 During this time of year everyone worries about being thought of as naughty or nice. For children being on Santa's nice list mean receiving a plethora of toys under the Christmas tree, but for larger, older kids (i.e. working adults), being on the nice list means getting a big holiday bonus and the possibility of doubling (or better) your yearly earnings. 
 Most S&P companies don't report their bonus figures until the early spring, but there are about 60 companies on the list that have fiscal years that end earlier, meaning they do report their bonuses before the New Year. This gives everyone else a chance to get a glimpse of what Santa has put under the Christmas tree for the CEOs on the "nice" list.

 America's 20 fastest growing salaries 
 When you interview for a job, conventional wisdom says you shouldn't bring up salary. Let the employer broach the topic first. After all, the last thing you want is to give the impression that you're only taking the job for the money. 
 If you think about it, the whole formality of salary discussion is strange. Understandably, an employer wants someone who is passionate about the job. But we all know that money is important, otherwise you'd be volunteering full time.
