 Two things can provide a massive jump start to your interior design career. You will be expected to have obtained an interior design bachelors degree and be accredited by the Council for Interior Design Accreditation (CIDA) or the National Council for Interior Design Qualification (NCIDQ). After that, the world is yours. Here are five interior design career choices to consider: 
 1. Interior Designer 
 This is the most obvious route for most designers. As an interior designer, you will be tasked with making the interiors of homes, offices, and other buildings beautiful. Interior designers have to be creative, understand color theory, and keep abreast with emerging interior design trends. The designers may work with residential or commercial clients. Residential interior designers are mostly involved with styling and interior decorating, fabrics and furnishing. Commercial interiors designers may work in retail, offices, restaurants, hotels, and education institutions. 
 2. Furniture Designers 
 Furniture design is a more specialized part of interior design. As a furniture designer, your work can be twofold; with the client and with other suppliers. When working with a client, you may be tasked with arranging furniture at houses, showrooms, offices, and other areas to use space optimally, bring out desired themes and so on. You may also work with your client’s suppliers such as carpenters, guiding them on what decorations to incorporate in the furniture to bring out your client’s tastes. 
 3. Exhibition Designers
