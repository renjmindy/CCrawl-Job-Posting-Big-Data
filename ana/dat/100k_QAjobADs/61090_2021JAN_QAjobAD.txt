 100 Best Jobs in America 
 We recently completed our annual project with CNN/Money Magazine that ranks the 100 Best Jobs in America. These jobs were determined by numerous factors, including pay, job growth, estimated employment levels, and various quality-of-life factors, such as job security. 
 The top jobs are a mix: some allow a lot of schedule flexibility ( Software Architect ), some require more training and education than that provided by a bachelor's degree ( Physician Assistant ), and some make the world a better place ( Environmental Engineer ).
