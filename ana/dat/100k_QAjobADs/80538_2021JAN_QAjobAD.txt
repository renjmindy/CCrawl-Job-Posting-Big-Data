 Required Qualifications 
 Depending upon the selected path, programs can range from two to four years. When selecting a program, students should understand that professional nursing associations are encouraging candidates to pursue a bachelor's degree for greater education and advancement opportunities in the healthcare industry. Bachelor's degree programs tend to require additional business management, advanced nursing, communication and science courses. 
 Once any required general education courses are completed, students spend their first year of nursing education learning the basics of the field. By their second year, students focus on patient care for a broad range of ages and illnesses. At this stage, neonatal care is likely only to be discussed generally or as one elective course. 
 Registered Nurse Licence 
 To practice as a registered nurse, graduates must pass the six-hour National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN). To maintain their licenses, registered nurses must also earn continuing education credits as mandated by their respective state licensing board.
