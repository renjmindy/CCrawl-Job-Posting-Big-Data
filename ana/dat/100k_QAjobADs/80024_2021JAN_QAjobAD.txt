 Certification Safeguards the Client 
 Zim—who is certified by the  American Council on Exercise —says it’s important to know how to train people. Without proper certification, clients are put at risk. “I highly suggest that somebody get certified to protect their clients from getting hurt. 
 Some fitness instructors have an associate’s or bachelor’s degree, according to the  Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) . Those may be degrees in exercise science, kinesiology, or physical education. 
 Working as fitness trainer allows people to be their own bosses and doesn’t necessarily require incurring a lot of costs, according to Zim. “I can take charge of something myself. I can create my own business by myself. There's no major overhead to becoming a trainer. I mean, really, you just need to learn what to do. And you can call yourself a trainer. You can take people to a park and train them in a park.” 
 Zim says he likes to switch up his clients’ routines to keep them from getting bored. He says, “My concept is to never do the same workout twice. I always want to push the client. If you're doing the same thing over and over again, clients will get bored and leave you. I believe in always making it interesting, changing it up.” 
 Zim’s workouts isolate specific muscles. He says, “So using weights, using cardio—I created a whole program that's very unique. I use much lighter weight than people are used to using in gyms.”
