 Online videos help a lot. Look at mock interviews, learn how to present yourself and make sure your body language is as expected. Update yourself with the content needed for your domain. Certifications are a plus. International work experience is a plus. 
 There is a standard question at the end of every interview - "Do you have any questions" for which people generally tend to say no. Do not do that. Read about the company, ask them meaningful questions about their organization. 
 5) On the day of the interview.. 
 If you are in Germany, it's best to attend the interview in person. If you are seeking a job from outside Germany, try your best to travel to Germany.

 Give your best shot. Be positive. Be honest.
