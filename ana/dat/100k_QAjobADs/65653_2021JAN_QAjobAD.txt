 The WAG Coach Certification   .  With the WAG coach certification, you learn the science of nutrition and also learn HOW to coach people. You get real-life client scenarios and your response is graded by one of our coaches. They even give you live feedback! 
 Do your research and get to know other experts in the field.  Some experts in the field that have online books, courses and newsletters with easy-to-consume information are Alan Aragon, Eric Helms, Precision Nutrition, Chris Kresser, Lyle McDonald and ADAPT Health Coach Training Program. 
 You have the passion, drive and education to be a nutrition coach. What actionable steps can you take to get started? 
 If you have been through a transformation yourself, you can start by mirroring whatever system worked for you. For example, if you were emailing with a coach weekly and that's what helped you, that's a system you can replicate for your own clients.  Use those general principles to help you create a system and structure that works for both you and your clients. 
 Look at other people in the field who are successful and ask for their advice. People are often honored to share what they've learned along the way, so don't be afraid to reach out! 
 Leverage your current network and the people that already know and trust you.  Reach out and tell them what you 're doing and how you can help them and the people in their circle.  This could be done through face-to-face conversations, phone calls, emails, text messages, social media and online networking programs. 
 Sign up for the  WAG Coach Certification  to get in-depth training on both the science of nutrition and the psychology of lasting change. 
 You'll work with an actual WAG coach and go through real-life practice scenarios to ensure you're ready to work with your own clients after graduating. 
 As a student and graduate, you'll also join our exclusive coaching community, where you'll be able to connect with and receive help from other students-in-process and Working Against Gravity coaches.
