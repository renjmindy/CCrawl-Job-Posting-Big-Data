 Ergonomics Certificate vs. Certification 
 Corporate or private-label certification is offered through a reputable ergonomics (training) company which offers certification in ergonomics such as a Certified Office Ergonomics Specialist (COESp) or similar credential after completing a short course in the basics of ergonomic theory and practice. 
 This is far different from a board-certified professional ergonomist (CPE) or certified industrial ergonomist (CIE) who typically has a degree in human factors/ergonomics, engineering, physical therapy or related field. These programs offer credentialing at a national level with a much more complex application and testing process along with peer review of various work samples. 
 Individuals who earn a  certificate in ergonomics from a private-label certification workshop  should recognize their limits in primarily evaluating  healthy employees  who are new hires, those who have relocated or just need assistance with workstation set up and fit or follow up from receiving new equipment. Depending on knowledge, confidence, and skill level, the in-house evaluator may be able to assist in performing a follow up to a professional evaluation to help assure implementation of recommendations. 
 For the in-house evaluator, proficiency comes from practice and skill application following methodology taught in training. However, improvement comes from additional course work or through validation of oneâ€™s work. More importantly, having the chance to work with a mentor will assure ongoing competency and confidence in building skill, knowledge, and critical thinking in ergonomics.
