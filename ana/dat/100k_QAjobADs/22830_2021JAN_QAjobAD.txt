 The chronological resume is the traditional format that most are accustomed to: Work History is detailed in order of date, usually most recent first, with duties outlined either in bullet or paragraph format beneath. A functional resume is more modern in approach and emphasizes skills over work history. The Skills or Qualifications sections are often split into several subsections. This can make it easier for employers to scan your qualifications to quickly see if you might have the skills they are looking for. Reported estimates are employers take 30 or even as little as 10 seconds to screen resumes. For this reason, a functional resume is most often the format to use to apply online or secure the first interview. A more detailed, chronological resume can be presented in a first or second interview if appropriate. 
 Skills 
 Subheadings with meaningful titles should be used to allow the employer to quickly scan a resume to see that you may have what they are looking for. Use no more than three or four, otherwise the purpose may be defeated. Group your skills from all of your jobs, past and present, under these subheadings. Use current voice – just because you are not working at a job currently doesn't mean you don't possess this skill! Likewise, include skills from unpaid positions as well as paid. 
 Work History 
 Again, include paid and unpaid positions – give yourself credit for everything you know and can do. If you don't, no one else ill. If you don't have a skill or experience required for a position you would like to pursue then volunteer or intern to acquire the missing attribute. Be forward thinking about your resume and your career. Most people don't work for the same employer for 30 years and retire with a gold watch these days. Plan now for your next job change if you are working. If you are looking for any job in the storm now, be mindful to plan beyond that next job.
