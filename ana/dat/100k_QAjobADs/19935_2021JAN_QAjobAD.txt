 Highlight New Degrees and Certifications 
 Generally speaking, professional resume writers will list education and credentials at the bottom of the first or second-page of your resume, after the professional overview. Of course, there are exceptions to every rule, but that is true for most professionals with more than 10 years of work experience. 
 However, if your career change hinges on a new certification or degree that you have earned, you might want to find a way to call attention to it. You can include the initials (such as PMP or MBA) after your name, highlight the degree/certificate in your achievements section, or move your education section to a more prominent position on your resume. 
 If you decide to move your education section to a higher position on your resume, you might want to consider breaking your professional experience into two separate sections. The first one would be related to experience (even an internship) that aligns with your new degree and career direction. The second one would be labeled something such as “Other Relevant Experience.” That section would be an abbreviated summary of your career experience not related to your new goals. 
 The reason you want to include older history that might not be related to your new career path is to establish that you are not a new graduate (and have experience that justifies you apply to more than just an entry-level position).
