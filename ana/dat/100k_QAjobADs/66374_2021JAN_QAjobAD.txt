 Secure Certifications 
 Not all welding industries require certifications; however, it is helpful to have one regardless. The  American Welding Society  offers a  Certified Welder Program  which provides a certification exam for $75. It is important to explore the industry youâ€™re interested to determine if certification is necessary. 
 Two more things about welding:  The industry has typically been a male-dominated field. But with the welder shortage, there are more efforts to attract women to the industry. Read  this  Atlantic  story  about "Women Who Weld" for more about their work to bring gender equity to welding.
