 Skills, Qualifications and TrustMark Registrations 
 The Job Seekers Public Profile contains details of the type of skills they describe themselves as having as well as any skills that they have registered with TrustMark. TrustMark is an independent scheme operated to promote and improve standards in the repair, maintenance and improvement sectors. Being TrustMark registered means that the tradesman has been assessed as reputable and trustworthy by the scheme operators. 
 The Job Seekers Public Profile will also provide details of any qualifications or certifications that they hold, and, possessing such qualifications may be instrumental in your decision making process. However, as WorkLocally does not verify any certifications / qualifications, please ensure that you check the Jobs Seekers certifications and qualifications where appropriate. 
 Feedback 
 When a Job has been undertaken by a Job Seeker, both the Job Seeker and Job Poster have the opportunity to leave Feedback about the job. Job Seekers and Job Posters can leave Positive, Neutral or Negative Feedback which, over time, is used to build the Public Profile of the WorkLocally member. 
 Although a more in-depth view of all Feedback left is available for review, the Positive Feedback Percentage, based on a Feedback score calculation, provides an overview of the feedback that the WorkLocally member has received over a 12 month period.
