 What is your coaching philosophy? 
As the principal owner of Quest Executive Coaching, I value the connection between professional fulfillment and personal happiness. I appreciate individuality and leadership at every level. I recognize our minds need to learn and grow to be fulfilled. My belief is that each person is capable of extraordinary accomplishments and the daily challenges are opportunities for people to flex their muscles. My mission is to be a catalytic partner to leaders and their teams as they make an impact and tackle challenges confidently. 
 As an International Coach Federation Associate Certified Coach, I am committed to a strong Code of Ethics and stringent Core Competencies. I blend my commitment, authenticity, and business acumen to provide productive coach / client results. The coach / client partnership creates an optimal environment for creating solutions. It is through taking on challenges and seeing through curious eyes, there will be personal, professional and organizational development.
