 I enrolled into NYU's Coaching Certification program, quit my job and started working for a coach. You see, when I made that choice, things started to fall into place. Just a year after the program, I started my own coaching practice. I put one foot in front of the other. 
 I'm going to be honest here, it wasn't always easy. It definitely took some sweat and tears, but the only way to get to the other side is through it. 
 Now, 6 years later, from that day I made the choice, I am so happy I did. 
 I want to share this story with you because if you are undecided about what direction you want to go, it might be because you're not listening to your true desire. 
 I believe the answers are within us and in order to live the life we imagined, we must be willing to listen to our inner voice. 
 As a coach, I help you drown out the noise in your head that is full of fear and doubt "shoulds" "if only" "someday when" and direct you to go confidently in the direction of your desires.
