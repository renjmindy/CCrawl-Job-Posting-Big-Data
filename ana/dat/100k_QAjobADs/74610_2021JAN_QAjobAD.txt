 Spark is looking to hire motivated, dedicated, and experienced Nurses. In this role, you'll be supporting individuals in the community requiring direct care with personal hygiene, wound care, bladder/bowel care, and surgery recovery. Care is tailored to each person, so each position is unique. Some clients need mainly in-home support. Others require support participating in community activities. Whatever the circumstances, we want people who will genuinely care about their well-being.
