 Now, I say move on. Get certified and then move on. I don't mean to belittle the usefulness of Salesforce Certifications. They are the college degree of the Salesforce world. A degree is a gatekeeper and so are Salesforce Certifications. If you aren't certified, you have to go the extra mile to prove your abilities. So, get your certifications and move on. 
 Now, here's my simple tips for passing the exams: 
 Join a study group -  https://success.salesforce.com/_ui/core/chatter/groups/GroupProfilePage?g=0F9300000001pLJ 
 Study, Study, Study - There are so many guides out there now that there's really no need to link a bunch here. Google it and you will be good to go. 
 Do the  Trails ! 
 Focus your learning - Each exam gives a percentage breakdown of what category the questions will be on. Focus your learning on the groups with the largest percentages.
