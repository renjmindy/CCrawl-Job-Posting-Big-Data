 Certification usually takes a little under a year to complete, though the curriculum is generally just as rigorous as most ADN programs, which means students must learn quite a bit in a significantly shorter period. 
 Additionally, like an ADN, LPN/LVN certifications will not allow nurses to progress very far in their careers, but they are always able to enroll in  additional education  to better their understanding and preparedness for the field. 
 Hopefully these explanations can help you understand what your options are in nursing.
