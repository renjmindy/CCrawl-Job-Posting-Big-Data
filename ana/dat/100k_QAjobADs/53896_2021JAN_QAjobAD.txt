 Certification/Training Requirements 
 In order to get the necessary licences and permits, certain classes of drivers may have to undergo formal training. 
 Drivers requiring a heavy vehicle licence (trucks and buses) need to complete an assessment for Heavy Vehicle Competency conducted by a Registered Training Organisation in some states (this is a specific NSW requirement - other States have their own training requirements) 
 Other Certificates that may be required for vehicle drivers include: 
 Certificate II in Driving Operations (Passenger Car Drivers) 
 Certificate III in Driving Operations (Bus and Truck Drivers)
