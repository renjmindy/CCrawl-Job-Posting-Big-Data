 Write Your Qualifications And PVP At The Top 
 This is something your potential manager sees at first glance. Highlight your education first and all relevant certifications that you have done. This section doesn’t only include educational qualifications, but you can also highlight your professional experience. 
 But before that, you must add your Personal Value Proposition (PVP) at the top. State who you are and what sets you apart from the rest of the candidates. State your strengths and what benefits the company would get by hiring you. This part does require a lot of time and thought to create a compelling statement that convinces the manager to call you. 
 Include Keywords To Get Through  Application Tracking System (ATS) 
 Many companies search for employees through an electronic system. There are certain keywords or qualities that a company is looking for, and if you don’t add those keywords, your application will go to the rejected pile. 
 Therefore, doing keyword research and adding them to your resume will increase your chances of selection. To do keyword research, print out the job ad, and start marking all the relevant keywords you think they might be looking for. Research about them on their websites and social media pages. This should help give you an idea of what type of employees they are looking for.
