 Job titles are the official names that describe the responsibilities of the job that is being performed **2. Qualifications, Skills & Experience ** 
 Job descriptions can help identify particular skills or abilities that are necessary for a position. You don’t expect a painter to have the same skills as a heavy machine operator. Do you expect that the drywall installer will need finishing experience, too? Does the job call for a commercial driver’s license, a degree or professional operator’s license? Is it an entry level position or does the job require someone with years of experience? 
 3. Job Duties 
 A job consists of a group of activities and tasks that employees must perform in order for a company to accomplish its goals. Listing job duties helps employees understand what is expected of them, but should be flexible to change as needed. There are many players on a baseball team. Everyone simply needs to understand their expected role. If everyone knows what their job is, they’re happier and able to be more productive in their specific role. 
 The ideal situation is having highly motivated and skilled employees who are eager to do more than their assigned tasks. Workers who are interested in learning new skills or take on extra responsibilities after their assigned work is done are an asset to a business. Unfortunately, not everyone is on the same wavelength. Some workers are only putting in time for the paycheck, and will refuse to assist beyond what they’re supposed to do. By including “and other duties assigned” to a job description, the employer can add new responsibilities to the job as needed.
