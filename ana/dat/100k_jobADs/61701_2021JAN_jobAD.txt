 Reality Bites - A Year of Art, Wolf Problems and Hard Decisions 
 2018 has, for many people I know myself included, been a really tough year. In terms of family, we've been through a lot of hard times, worst than most, and survived it, though it's fair to say that my family now is considerably smaller. That means that close family friends we've had for years, and in some cases my entire life, really  do  mean the world to us! ‚ù§ 
 I learnt years ago that  family is not about blood  , it's about who loves you unconditionally and who you love unconditionally, about special friends, people you can rely on in good times and bad and people you'd do anything for. I'd jump in front of a bullet for either of my darling Goddaughters and would do anything for my lovely supportive mates in deepest darkest Wales who I feel such a kinship with. 
 So when we faced the prospect of losing several very close and dear family friends to various cancers, including my lovely Godmother (who thankfully beat all the odds and the grim prognosis she was given); it makes you reassess things and clarify what is really important - a case of  " Don't sweat the small stuff!" . 
 While I'm able to produce a lot of high quality art relatively quickly, something I admit has always come easily to me, I must stop beating myself up for being less prolific in my writing. As much as I love writing and it's always been a part of who I am, it does take a greater toll on my health and tends to burn me out quite badly. 
 Part of recovering from illness is being honest with yourself about what you can and can't do and not castigating yourself for your limitations. Too many of us are our worst critics and being too critical of oneself can be tantamount to  creative paralysis! 
 So despite being the world's slowest writer (George R.R. Martin ain't got nothing on me!) I'm determined not to spend 2019 procrastinating over how slow I am. I  WILL  finish Book 2 and Book 3 and finish the series, but I'll have to do that at a pace I can cope with. Ironically, I actually have two brand new short novellas out,  _ A Friendship Forged  _ and  The Siege of Kallorm , published by  Grimbold Books  on  December 1st 2018  , which are set before the events in my novel  White Mountain  , so at least that's something new for my incredibly patient and loyal fans. üòÄ ‚ù§ 
 This year it's been great to see my illustration business take off and how ridiculously busy I've been with commissions, but the dominating factor has been the sadness surrounding one of my four wolfies becoming disabled. Anyone that knows me, knows how important my boys are to me, I'm called the  ' Mistress Of Wolves'  for a reason! So facing a horrible inherited disease that has no cure, that we can do nothing about and that is always fatal,  Degenerative Myelopathy  (DM), has been a devastating blow. üò¶ My two white German Shepherds turned 9 years in June, not exactly old dogs, but long before that my beloved Tolly was diagnosed with DM. üò¶ We've spent thousands we can't afford on trying to fight this horrific disease but to no avail. The only comfort we have is the fact that we've tried our very best even using the latest cutting edge veterinary techniques like Platelet Rich Plasma to help combat this disease. It's been heartbreaking to see Tolly's startlingly swift decline over the year from running around in the snow in February to being unable to walk or stand by the end of August when he lost the use of his back legs completely and had to have a doggie wheelchair. We now face another devastating realisation that his biological brother, Korrun, is also now showing clear signs of having DM too. üò¶ 
 In a strange way, it was Tolly's illness that pushed me onto  creating more artwork  this year (to pay for extortionate vet bills) and was the catalyst to me eventually opening my first Etsy Shop -  Sophie's Artisan Arts , which has really helped since setting it up in July. The highlight of the year though was being a shortlisted ** 'Best Artist'** in the  2018 British Fantasy Awards  and being an Artist-In-Residence for  Dan Holloway  's fabulous Oxford University funded game,  Mycelium , which was launched in October and for which I created all the artwork (50 images in total). Still so proud to be involved in such an amazing project. 
 The other unsaid thing, which will remain unsaid by me for a while until I'm ready to talk about it, has also been all consuming this year. I've battled it alone as I just haven't been in a place where I feel comfortable sharing it with anyone or asking for help (something I've always been bad at). 
 What the future brings, I don't know‚Ä¶lol, but my life has certainly never followed a conventional path! üòÄ 
 Even when I was a kid I knew that certain paths were not for me. I never wanted that fantasy princess day, walking down the aisle in a white dress, centre of attention, to exchange one man's name for another. Hell no. I know it works for most people, so good for them, but it's not for me. I'm a great believer in personal freedom and in everyone choosing the path that suits them best rather than 'doing the norm'. Life's too short to waste it following someone else's idea of how to live rather than what works for you and makes you happy. 
 With that in mind‚Ä¶I've decided  NOT  to make any  New Year resolutions . üòÄ 
 
 2019 will bring what it will bring. I have aspirations I'd like to achieve, but I know life rarely follows the route you think it will, so I'm just going to plod on, try to learn to say "NO" to people when I know I don't have time to do something (rather than killing myself to get it done in time) and just  ' roll with the punches'! 
 So‚Ä¶Happy New Year everyone, I hope 2019 brings you happiness and peace in whatever form that means to YOU.
