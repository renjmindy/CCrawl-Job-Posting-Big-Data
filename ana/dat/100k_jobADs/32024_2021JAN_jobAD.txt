 5/25/14 -  Learning Commons Librarian 
Zayed University, Dubai, UNited Arab Emirates 
 The University  : Zayed University is an innovative institution based on an international model of higher education. With approximately 550 full-time faculty serving approximately 9500 undergraduate and 1000 graduate students on its campuses in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. English is the primary language of instruction and administration. Zayed University is fully accredited in the UAE and by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education in the US. The United Arab Emirates is a progressive country known for its high standard of living and its safe and family-friendly environment. 
 The Opportunity  : Zayed University seeks a librarian to assist in the daily operation of the Learning Commons on the Dubai Campus. The new Learning Commons is a space in the Library that seeks to support students, staff, and faculty in their use of rich and emerging technologies for learning and research, and specializes in assistance with the pursuit of English language skills and development. 
 Sarah P 's comments : Zayed is arguably one of the better academic institutions in the UAE. That said I have had friends apply there, have interviews that went well, and thenâ€¦nothing. This is business as usual for hiring practices in the Middle East.
