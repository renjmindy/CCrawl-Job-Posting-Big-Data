 Over 1 billion smallholder farmers produce 80% of the world's food, and four of the five most traded commodities on earth, yet the vast majority lack access to the internet and even basic information to help them solve problems or share ideas. No one has built a platform for these farmers. Until Wefarm. Wefarm is already the worldâ€™s largest farmer-to-farmer digital network, with more than 1 million farmers using our ecosystem in Kenya and Uganda alone. Our farmers share more than 40,000 questions and answers every day. Farmers connect with one another to solve problems, share ideas, and spread innovation, for free, and without needing an internet connection (Wefarm works even through SMS). Utilising the latest machine learning technology, Wefarmâ€™s service gets bespoke, crowd- sourced information to help farmers increase yields, gain insight into pricing, tackle the effects of climate change, source the best quality seeds, fertiliser, and loans and diversify their agricultural interests. With the smallholder global agricultural market valued at over 400 billion USD, our vision is to create a digital online/ offline ecosystem for global smallholder agriculture. WeFarm has won Googleâ€™s prestigious Impact Challenge Award, the MEFFYS Award for Innovation in Technology, the Messaging and SMS World Awardsâ€™ Best SMS Solution, Business Rocksâ€™ Global Startup Pitch Battle, Chivas Regalâ€™s The Venture Competitionâ€™s UK prize, and 2nd place in their Global final and the European Union Commissionâ€™s Ideas from Europe Prize.
