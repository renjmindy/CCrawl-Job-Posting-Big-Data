 "Redefining my Happiness" - Nayana Nair 
 so as the last effort to rescue me 
they came in, 
dressed in the ultimate cool lifestyle. 
 they handed me all the tools that i might need 
to break away from the 'sad' in me. 
they filled me up with clocks that told the wrong time, 
told me that i would get used to the thrill of it. 
 told me to scrape down 
whatever stands in my way to happiness. 
told me my happiness should now be 
keeping an eye on the better guy, the better job, 
better photos on social media to highlight the same, 
weekends in lightless room with strangers. 
 when i became nauseous from too much change, 
when i ran into the fire 
to save the idea i had of myself, 
they held me back, 
told me i would develop a taste for such things 
i just needed some help, some influence, 
some liquid courage, some castles of smoke, 
guts to throw away everything that doesn't serve a purpose. 
they told me to talk like the ones who hurt me 
and to call it empowerment.

 "Ready to Break" - Nayana Nair 
 We are the mediocre television soap 
that no one wants to see. 
We have learned to gulp down bland food, bland life. 
The books that get us jobs, get us friends, gets us love, 
we have learned to pay for it without bitterness. 
 We adore the mania, the depression, 
the moments when we don't want to think clear- 
that makes us feel alive, 
anything like that, 
we are ready to call it love. 
 In our small hands we carry 
whatever meaning we have left in us- 
the offering that no gods want. 
We are ready to break for anyone 
who is ready to break for us.

 "A Silent Machinery" - Nayana Nair 
 I put on my favorite show 
(that I have seen for umpteenth time), 
increase the volume, 
fill my plate. 
My eyes glued to TV 
notices too late all that I have spilled, 
fill my plate with things I won't eat. 
 The same beautiful scene. 
Under the yellow light 
stand two actors, 
pretending to be in love, 
doing a better job at it 
that we ever could, 
saying words 
we could never say. 
 My heart breaks to see this love, 
it pops like a bubble wrap, 
bursts like a bubble of daydreams. 
No, it doesn't hurt. 
I just hear a sound 
from the otherwise silent machinery 
that keeps me running. 
 I am glad you meant enough to me 
to have become 
a familiar bump on the familiar road 
that my heart always takes.

 "Saviour" - Nayana Nair 
 This sad heart of yours, 
this heart that I love the most, 
I wondered once 
why it couldn't rise above what it is suffering from 
even when you have me. 
Why as I sit with you talking about myself 
you smile as if trying to contain the tears 
that you won't be able to explain. 
 x 
 I have always felt that even though 
we were meant to go through everything together 
it was just me 
looking at you 
fighting someone who I couldn't even see. 
 x 
 Every drop of love that I bring to you 
end up being just another drop of expectation 
that helps you drown that much faster. 
 x 
 And when I am done being disappointed with myself 
for being insufficient, 
for not being able to make a difference in your life, 
I end up thinking that maybe 
sometimes love cannot exorcise 
the feelings that we have for ourselves 
and maybe I just need to learn to see the you 
who is able to smile instead of all that you suffer from 
with pride 
instead of taking pity on you 
and trying to replace you as your saviour 
when you are doing a fine job being one yourself.

 "Unnoticed" - Nayana Nair 
 Yesterday, a line etched on my hands 
slipped away from the skin that once held it so dearly 
and still I lived on as if the the fate I lived now 
was the one I was destined for. 
I like to call it yesterday 
for it is easy to suppose that we always knew what was coming, 
that the things we lost didn't entirely go unnoticed. 
When in fact most days we wake up remembering 
details about things that have gone to places 
where they no longer have to care whether they are still forgotten 
by people like us who do such a poor job of caring for anything. 
We are always too young to know or too old to bother. 
All that find a way to us through this forest of sadness 
are disappointed to see what we are 
and try best to stay, to lurk around, to be of some use to us, 
till we drop them from our mind, 
and they stare us in face and try to digest the excuses 
that we didn't even care to give.
