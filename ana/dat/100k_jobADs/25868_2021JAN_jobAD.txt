 I like the feeling of beauty inside a program. Not just any program. My background has been focused around OOP, but I am trying to branch out into other territories, such as Functional Languages. I want to go back to an idea of simplicity.

 Steve Jobs 
 apple.com 2011-10-05 at 10.43.35 PM 
 When  Steve Jobs  died, the world lost a complex visionary. The asshole who declared floppy disks obsolete in circa 1989. The weirdo that gave us the  NeXT cube , with its absurd magnesium body, its beautifully architected OS and this obscure language no-one else was using, Objective-C. The man who gave a name to those strange devices called "MP3 players" that nobody was using, and who insisted on the necessity of single-button mice. Not forgetting the businessman unafraid to admit his LSD experiences. 
 You don't see too many people like that. More holistically, this guy made me understand that engineering and business can meet with art and idealism, and for that I am grateful.
