 Gladeo League Spotlights and Profiles 
 
 Gladeo is a non-profit 501(c)(3) that aims to create a database of business profiles as a means of helping younger generations decide what they want to do for a living and what kind path they can take to get there. 
 I began working with Gladeo in the summer of 2017 as a member of the Gladeo League, the organization's internship program. 
 I primarily work on two kinds of pieces:  Career Spotlights  , which take a closer look at professionals working in an industry and how they've succeeded through Question and Answer-styled interviews, and  Career Profiles  , which are examinations of specific jobs, namely what they entails to find and succeed in a given position. 
 In August 2018, I became the Managing Editor for the Gladeo League. On top of editing and publishing pieces for other reporters online, the opportunity offered me the chance to lead biweekly meetings, run the Gladeo blog, hire new interns and complete larger projects for the organization.
