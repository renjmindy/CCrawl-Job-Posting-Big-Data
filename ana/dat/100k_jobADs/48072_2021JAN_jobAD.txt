 Dear Sir/ Madam: 
 I am 45 years old Filipina who has no experience as a caregiver here in the Philippines and abroad and have no reference letters to submit. Will I still be qualified and be chosen to work as a caregiver in Canada? I have attended a 7 month Live-in Caregiver Course here in the Philippines and graduated in 2002. 
 Thank you for responding. 
 Sincerely, 
 Marion G.
