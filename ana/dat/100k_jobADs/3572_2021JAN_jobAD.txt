 #Nonprofit Jobs Tips 
 If you're interested in working with a nonprofit, the best approach is to volunteer first to figure out the culture and style. If that doesn't pan out, then it's time to search for jobs online. Besides general job websites like monster.com, you could narrow your search to websites that specialize in the nonprofit sector. Below are some options: 
 https://www.workforgood.org/jobs/ 
 https://www.idealist.org/ 
 https://www.bridgespan.org/ 
 https://www.philanthropy.com/ 
 https://careers.councilofnonprofits.org/ 
 http://nonprofit-jobs.org/ 
 To get a job at a nonprofit, a passion for the organization programs is a must. Read up on it online, including the latest news on it in the media to emphasize your interest. Next are some issues I noted many people do when trying to get a job with a nonprofit. 
 Dress formally  -- Don't assume that just because it's a nonprofit, you can go in wearing sweatpants, for instance. Proper dressing shows respect and professionalism. It's better to overdress since most employers understand that people want to make a good impression. 
 Don 't talk badly about other organizations  -- This could be done saying that a place has a toxic environment or something more subtle. Sometimes when giving examples of situations, people slip and show issues that should have been kept private. 
 Check tax returns at guidestar.com  -- Tax returns- 990- can show how the organization is doing financially, details about each program, and even salaries of board members and the five highest employees. Look at page 7- Part VII. 
 Happy job hunting!!
