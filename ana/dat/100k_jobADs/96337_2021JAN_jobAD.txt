 Job: Reference/Instruction Librarian 
 Posted on  July 4, 2014  by   sarahgprescott 
 7/1/14 -  Reference/Instruction Librarian 
The American University in Cairo, Egypt 
 Under the direction of the Head of Research and Information Services, the successful candidate will be responsible for the development and delivery of library services and resources that facilitate research and learning at the university. 
 AUC is an English-medium institution; eighty-five percent of the students are Egyptian and the rest include students from nearly ninety countries, principally from the Middle East, Africa and North America. 
 Sarah P 's comments : This could be a good opportunity for someone with the required experience to begin an international career. Having said that, I would do some careful research as Egypt is in a particularly vulnerable position at the moment and many long-term expat residents have left.
