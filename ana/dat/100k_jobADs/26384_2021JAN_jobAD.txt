  Keep Your Career Success Goals With You at All Times  
 Bud Bilanich 
 August 24, 2012 
 Success Tweet : Keep your goals with you – in your wallet, or on your screen saver. They will be a constant reminder of what you will achieve.  Notice the last two words in the tweet – “will achieve.” I didn’t say, “hope to achieve,” or “want to achieve,” or worse yet “try to achieve.” I said, “will achieve.” “Will achieve” is a positive, proactive statement that reinforces your visualization of your career success. As the tweet suggests, keeping your goals close at hand is a constant reminder of what you will achieve. Thinking in terms of “will achieve” rather than “hope to achieve,” want to achieve,” or “try to achieve” is a solid piece of career advice. The other day, I saw a quote from John Wooden, legendary college basketball coach, and the author of several books on life and career success. This career success coach has them all in his library. Coach Wooden’s success pyramid is a truly comprehensive look at how to become the life and  career success  you deserve to be. Here is the quote: 
 "I am not as good as I ought to be. I am not as good as I want to be. I am not as good as I'm going to be. But I am thankful that I am better than I used to be." 
 
 Notice that Coach Wooden uses positive affirmative language when he says,  “I am not as good as I’m going to be.”  Even at 99 years old, he was still growing. Keeping your  career success goals  with you is a great way to help you become as good as you’re going to be. For one thing, keeping your goals nearby makes it easy for you to reflect on them several times a day – see the post I did on this. For another, keeping your goals with you, makes them part of you. I keep my goals in my wallet. They’re easily accessible. I pull them out and look at them so often I usually have to print a second copy midyear. The originals tend to get creased, dirty and threadbare from so much folding and unfolding. Having my goals in my wallet in right front pants pocket every day makes them seem more real to me. Reviewing them a couple of times a day motivates me to do the work I need to do to accomplish them. As I often am when I write these blog posts, I’m on a plane. I just wrote all of this week’s posts. Then I took a minute to stretch and review my goals. One of those goals is to create a membership site using  Success Tweets  and these blog posts as part of the content. The sooner I write all 140 blog posts, the sooner I’ll be able to put up my membership site. The sooner the membership site goes up, the sooner I’ll be helping more people take advantage of my career success coach thoughts and ideas. Just reviewing my goals gave me the energy to keep writing, instead of reading for the last hour of the flight. See how this works? First of all, be thankful for being better than you were, believe that you will be better than you are. Use your goals – the things you will achieve – to inspire you to do the work necessary to become better than you are, and to become the life and career success you deserve to be. Pretty good career advice, if I do say so myself. The common sense career success coach point here is simple. Successful people set and achieve high goals. Goals are your promise to yourself that you will become better than you are. If you follow the advice in Tweet 26 in  Success Tweets  ,  “Keep your goals with you – in your wallet, or on your screen saver. They will be a constant reminder of what you will achieve.”  You will be more likely to achieve your goals, become better than you are, and create the life and career success you want and deserve. I keep my goals in my wallet, and look at them at least a couple of times a day. Try this career success coach advice. You’ll be surprised at how much you can accomplish.  Photo credit: Shutterstock
