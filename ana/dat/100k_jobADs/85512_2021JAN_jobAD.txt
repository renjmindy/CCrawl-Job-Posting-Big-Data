  Job Rejection: How Can I Get Back on the Horse?  
 Work It Daily 
 September 16, 2009 
 Dear Experts, I have been job searching since August 2008; I also graduated in November of the same year. I have landed numerous interviews at various companies and have yet to land an offer. In fact, I have had 3 interviews in the last 3 weeks and was rejected for all 3 within the past week; one of them I REALLY thought I had a good chance of getting. I have implemented most of the advice you have shared over Twitter, etc. and over the past month, I have found myself losing hope about finding a job; coupled with the recent rejection, it's hard for me to even write a cover letter. I'm not sure if its just a case of being burned out or depression is getting the best of me. Do you have any advice on how I can get back on the horse?  Here is how our T.A.P. experts answered this question:   Q#292  Start making "deposits" for success in family, physical exercise, & personal dev to combat that depression! ( @beneubanks )  Q#292  Break frm job search 4 a few days 2 week. Get a fresh outlook. Work out nd eat more veggies 2 fight depression. ( @kgrantcareers )  Q#292  Take a day off and do something fun. Sometimes you just need to clear your mind to get back on track. ( @gradversity )  Q#292  Ouch! I had 2 yr srch; 1 foot in front of other, no stone unturnd. "never give up!" "darkest b4 dawn" ( @juliaerickson )  Q#292  Job seekers today struggle w/ the same level of rejection as actors, models & musicians. Don't give up! ( @jtodonnell )  Our Twitter Advice Project (T.A.P.) is no longer an active campaign. To find an answer to the above question, please use the "Search" box in the right-hand column of this website.
