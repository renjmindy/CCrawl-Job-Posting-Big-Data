 "Secular" jobs vs "Full-time" ministry 
 On  June 28, 2013  By  Rob In  Devotional 
 
 If you are in a secular job that doesn 't violate scripture, your vocation is just as important to God as is a full-time missionary in India. God calls each of us to our vocation. It is in that vocation where He desires to use us for His kingdom. 
 Os Hillman 
 
 
 _The architect who designs buildings to the glory of God, who works with integrity, diligence, fairness, and excellence, who treats his wife with the love Christ has for the Church, who raises his children in Godly wisdom and instruction, who urges non-Christian coworkers and associates to heed the gospel message -- in short, who acts as a responsible manager in the various arenas God has entrusted him -- this man will receive eternal praise from God. That is what really matters in eternity. In short, God's interest is not simply that we do holy activities but that we become holy people. Not pious. Not sanctimonious. Not otherworldly. But pure, healthy, Christlike. _ 
 Doug Sherman & William Hendricks 
 
 If you're a Christian, you're always a full-time minister, regardless of whether you have a day-job or whether you are a paid church worker.
