 The job search process 
 January 3, 2019January 30, 2019   lindakempwriter 
 I am busy applying for jobs. Each day, I receive emails from online job search sites, such as seek or indeed. I flick through and I apply for any role I think I'm well matched to. 
 The part that scores deep with each application is the key selection criteria. When did this become so cumbersome. Some of the jobs I'm interested in are part-time roles that are barely above an entry-level admin position. Yet there are, in some cases, over ten key selection criteria! And in each one, there is always, ALWAYS, the criterion of being proficient in MS Office products. I mean, in today's high-tech world, how many have not ever opened a Word document? Very few, would be my guess. 
 I know the market is competitive. I get that. I know that roles are hotly contested. But I also know that application letters and interview performances are rarely an indicator of the best person for the job. There are often applicants who swan into the interview and toot their own horn ably and without any level of self-consciousness. This often doesn't mean they are going to fill the requirements of the role. There are others who fumble and squirm in an interview, like me (that didn't surprise you, did it?). I know I'll be GREAT, if only I can get through the discomforting experience of telling a panel of strangers, who hold my future and livelihood in their hands, how fabulous I am and well-suited to the role. 
 But back to key selection criteria. Jeez, I wish there was another way. For now, though, I'll continue to delve my way through them. 
 Many of them. So many, I have no idea how many applications I have out there. It's a  mystery  which one I will end up with, but I know I'll get one, eventually.

 All the best with your searching Linda. I think many applications have become bloated because assumptions cannot be made and an employer could find they have a new employee who is not fit for purpose and nowhere to turn. At least, that's what I've seen lately.

 I once sat on a selection committee, and the experience scared me for life, but one thing it did teach me is that I should NEVER feel bad about not getting a position and I should NEVER feel superior for getting a position. People on selection committees are NUTS. One quick example (I have dozens): this was 'back in the day' and there were three of us on the committee, and one member wanted to EXCLUDE all applications that were typewritten, and the other one wanted to exclude all applications that were handwritten -- get the idea? I aged badly during this process. The end product was us (not me, I was the one dissenting vote) appointing the second best candidate, even though the best candidate was WAY more qualified and experienced. To make the experience even more annoying, I got the job of telling the best person that they had not been offered the job!!!
