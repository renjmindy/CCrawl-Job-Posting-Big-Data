 MGM Resorts International to host jobs fair in New Jersey for MGM National Harbor 
 __ Marie Kelley 
 __ August 10, 2016 
 __ Latest Casino and Gambling News ,  Employment & Careers ,  Maryland ,  New Jersey 
 In preparation to fill hundreds of positions that will be needed once the  MGM National Harbor  opens in  Maryland , the parent company of the project, MGM Resorts International, will be hosting a jobs fair today and tomorrow. Interestingly enough, the job fair will be taking place in Atlantic City at the  Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa . The MGM National Harbor casino is currently under construction, costing $1.3 billion to create. 
 Last week, MGM bought out Boyd Gaming Corp., their former Borgata partner, for $900 million and are now looking for individuals to fill several positions within the new casino venue. MGM will be hiring cocktail servers, bartenders, and technicians for slot games as well as dealers for table games. 
 MGM National Harbor is expected to open in the fourth quarter, with positions needing to be filled in the meantime. The job fair was brought to  Atlantic City  just after the Trump Taj Mahal announced they would be closing in October, with almost 3,000 individuals losing their employment.
