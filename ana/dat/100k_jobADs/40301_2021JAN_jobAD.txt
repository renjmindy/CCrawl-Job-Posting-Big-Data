 By NY Workers Compensation Attorneys 
 **On the Job Injury Attorney - Queens, NY ** 
 Some jobs require workers to move their bodies in repetitive ways. Oftentimes, unnatural motions performed repeatedly can result in a repetitive stress injury which can not only be painful, but also result in the inability to work. If you have been diagnosed with a repetitive stress injury, it is recommended that you speak with a Queens, New York on the job injury attorney today. Workers’ compensation benefits may be available to you; however, to receive them in their maximum amount, you may benefit from having the legal team at  Polsky, Shouldice & Rosen, P.C.  on your side. 
 Repetitive Stress Injuries 
 According to OSHA, repetitive stress injuries account for at least one third of all workers’ compensation claims filed in the US. These types of injuries are broad and can be located on all parts of the body. They are a result of repetitive movements, motions, or postures that cause strain, and eventually an injury. It may take several months or even years to notice the physical symptoms. In general, the longer it takes to notice them, the more damage has been done. 
 Because of the complexity of workers' compensation claims, particularly in relation to repetitive stress injuries, you may benefit from speaking with a Queens, NY on the job injury attorney before you attempt to file a claim. Legal guidance can be valuable under such circumstances, because some workers’ compensation providers tend to reject repetitive stress claims as injuries resulting from non-work activity. An experienced Queens, NY on the job injury attorney understands how to successfully counter this stance, whenever possible. 
 How Repetitive Stress Injuries Happen 
 Today, many workplaces are fast moving and request employees to exert their bodies to the limit. Sitting or standing for excessive periods of time, while conducting tasks, can lead to inflammation, pain, and injury. Certain worker populations may be especially prone to repetitive stress injuries: 
 Computer Workers -  Sitting in front of a computer for hours every day can result in neck and shoulder pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and eye problems. 
 Construction Workers -  People who work in the construction industry may be especially prone to repetitive stress injuries. Repetitive motions of swinging a hammer, heavy lifting, looking upwards for long periods of time, or using a jackhammer can cause long term injuries. 
 Workers Who Sit or Stand a Lot -  Excessive standing or sitting can damage the body. Whether you sit at a desk for 7 hours a day or work as a waitress for many hours, you may be at risk for developing a repetitive stress injury. 
 Commercial Painters -  Painters, as well as window washers, use the back, neck, and shoulders while working. They may develop neck pain and pain in other parts of their body that is a result of standing or constant looking upwards. 
 This is just a sampling of those working populations especially prone to repetitive stress injuries. If you have developed a repetitive stress injury, and would like to know whether or not you can get workers’ compensation, please call a  Queens, NY on the job injury attorney  today.
