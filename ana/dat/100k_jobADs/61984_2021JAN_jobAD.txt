 Network Tracing for Test Jobs

 During recipe development, developers test recipes by going to the  Test Jobs  tab and clicking the  Test  button. This update shows the network tracing for test jobs giving detailed HTTP header, request and response information. 
 How does this help? 
 Users want increased developer productivity and robust recipes. Developers want bug-free recipes. 
 With the network tracing for test jobs, developers can: 
 
 Detect errors early on during recipe development to create more robust recipes 
 Resolve errors faster by troubleshooting the HTTP call details like headers and request payload 
 Easily cross-check recipe logic with the action input and output to network tracing HTTP request 
 Test the recipe as usual - network tracing should automatically show up 
 
 Network tracing is an ideal way to review HTTP calls during development without needing any extra effort from developer or ops. 
 How does it work? 
 Network tracing for test jobs serves as the network-borne early warning (NEW) like the AWACS (airborne warning and control system). Developers test the recipes as they always do by going to the recipe editing mode and clicking the  Test  button. The network tracing for the actions will be available in the  Debug  tab.
