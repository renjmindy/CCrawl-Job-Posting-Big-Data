 5 Tips for Professional Networking on LinkedIn 
 Posted on  June 19, 2011  by   Buddy_Scalera 
 
 LinkedIn Logo 
 Because of the rapid growth of social media sites like Facebook and LinkedIn, many people are unsure of how they should draw the line between professional and personal communications. It's a bit of a balancing act, but if you follow a few rules of thumb, you'll do a better job of managing your professional brand. 
 First off, if you aren't yet familiar with it yet,  LinkedIn  has become the hot destination for professional networking. It's the ultimate social and professional mixer that helps people connect through career experiences. 
 Essentially, you go to LinkedIn to create a  living resume . It may help you get discovered by HR recruiters or former co-workers. So it is essential for you to market yourself properly. Here are five easy tips for making the most of LinkedIn. 
 1. Be professional. 
It's strange to even say this, but you need to treat LinkedIn as you would any other workplace. Consider LinkedIn just another extension of your career, because for now, it kind of is. There are enough working professionals on LinkedIn that you must assume that everything you write is going to be seen and interpreted by some of your co-workers. 
 Separate your personal online life (e.g., Facebook) with your professional online life (i.e., LinkedIn). There is the "work you" and the "home you." LinkedIn is the place for the work version of yourself.  Continue reading ->

 Funemployment - Fun for the unemployed 
 Posted on  June 10, 2009  by   Buddy_Scalera 
 As the recession drags on, more people I know are losing their jobs. It's sad and scary, especially for people who have children to support. 
 But apparently, it's not all gloom and doom for the unemployed. Some people are calling themselves "funemployed." That is, if they're going to be unemployed, they're still going to have some fun. 
 
 Here's an quote from the LA Times: 
 For the 'funemployed,' unemployment is welcome 
These jobless folks, usually singles in their 20s and 30s, find that life without work agrees with them. Instead of punching the clock, they're hitting the beach. 
 
 I have a friend who has been out of work for two months now. He's single with no kids, a low mortgage, and COBRA benefits. He saved his money carefully and plans to take his time looking for work…after the summer. He looks relaxed and happy for someone without a job. 
 So, even though a lay off can be difficult, I hope that people can still manage to have a good summer and enjoy the time off. Have some fun, you'll be back to work soon.
