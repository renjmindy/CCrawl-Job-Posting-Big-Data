 We are looking for a candidate that would enjoy working full time dayside hours, Monday through Friday and or early mornings. 
 Making people’s day on all fronts:  Greeting people, taking orders and satisfying McCravings. 
Preparing food and keeping our world famous burgers and fries, world famous. 
Processing payments. Working cash, working your smile. 
Package take-out food. But no sneaking fries…we know they’re everybody’s favourite! 
Fridge management. Okay, it’s stocking the fridge, but it’s really important when you serve the world’s most popular burger.
