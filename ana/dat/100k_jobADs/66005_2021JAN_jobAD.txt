 Thanks to rapid growth, my client, a private equity backed software business with an exciting growth plan requires an accounts receivable and invoicing assistant . Staff welfare is hugely important to this business as is customer service and with a growing order book the rest of 2020 and 2021 is looking very exciting. This organisation offers flexible working and a number of staff benefits to attract the very best candidates. 
 This is a newly created role with dual responsibility of supporting cash collection and raising client invoices. You will be supporting the collections manager in reducing debt levels, cash collection and building internal relations with the sales team. The second part of the role will focus on raising invoices and working with the sales team to ensure these invoices are correct. 
 The ideal candidate will have some cash collection and/or invoicing experience with a strong grasp of MS excel and word. We are looking for someone who is motivated to learn and is able to be part of a small finance team. 
 This is a rare opportunity for someone to growth their career in collections and invoicing whilst working for a company that will support training and learning. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
