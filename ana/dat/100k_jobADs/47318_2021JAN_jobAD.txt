 Hi all, 
 So it looks like Paypal is massively expanding in Ireland, adding up to 1000 jobs in Ireland over 4 years, at a new Paypal customer care centre in Dundalk, Co Louth. 
 Dundalk is situated about an hour from Dublin..( I know it well, that's where I got my first job @ National Pen! ) 
 If you click on the below link, it will land you straight at all the vacancies .
