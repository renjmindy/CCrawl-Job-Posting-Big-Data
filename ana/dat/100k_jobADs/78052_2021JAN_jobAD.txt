 Career 
 Wickert as an employer 
 
 Successful, family-managed, medium-sized enterprise (SME) in the mechanical engineering sector with a long tradition 
 As a family-run medium-sized company we belong to the majority: 
 
 99% of all companies in Germany are medium-sized companies 
 We (medium-sized companies) make up 60% of all jobs and 82% of all training places in Germany 
 We are the job engine of the German economy 
 We, Wickert, provide security for our employees 
 
 In good times as well as in bad, we hold together as a family. Family business for more than three generations. 
 We cultivate a family corporate culture. We live flat hierarchies. Our communication channels are short and personal. 
 
 Worldwide activity in many different industries 
 Very high production diversity and variety. With us you are always involved in new projects. At WICKERT, almost every press or system is a new project. Always get to know new industries and technologies. Be there when innovations arise. 
 High vertical range of manufacture 
 We have a high vertical range of manufacture. This means we can produce a lot of parts for our presses ourselves. 
 Thanks to our own machining department, the hydraulic department, the control cabinet construction, as well as the hardware and software departments, we are able to control the quality of the individual components 100 percent. 
 All from one hand. Consultation, annual maintenance or retrofit of our customers' machinery and press systems 
 We rely on long-term and sustainable relationships. 
 With us you have a varied activity. You work across departments and always get a look into many different areas. 
 WICKERT is in the heart of the South Palatinate. In the university and fortified town of Landau, there are numerous cultural offers. The southern wine route is a popular holiday region.
