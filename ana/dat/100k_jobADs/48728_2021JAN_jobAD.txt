 Automatic evaluation of critical jobs at risk

 You can now set the riskConfidence optman key to obtain an automatic evaluation of the risk level for a critical job. 
If the probability of completing the critical job before the deadline is below the level you set for the riskConfidence key, the critical job is considered at high risk. The calculation is performed by comparing the confidence factor of completing before deadline and the percentage specified in this parameter. 
For more information, see the  Global options - detailed description  section in the Administration Guide.
