 A Few Freelance Writing Job Resources 
 August 31, 2015August 30, 2015  /  Lisa J. Jackson (@lisajjackson) 
 Here are a few writing-related sites you can check into for freelance or contract gigs. Most of them offer a lot more than jobs, too. 
 Freelance Writing Gigs : http://www.freelancewritinggigs.com/ "Whether youâ€™re a seasoned writer or a beginner, the information you need to be a successful writer is at your fingertips here at Freelance Writing Jobs!" (check out the Resources for Writers tab off the main page; business tips, job hunting tips, writing tips, and a lot more) 
 Make a Living Writing : http://www.makealivingwriting.com/ "Iâ€™m Carol Tice, an award-winning, fun-loving freelance writer living in the Seattle area. Iâ€™m obsessed with helping writers earn more from their work." (a lot of free resources; podcasts; downloads; monthly membership-fee community; and a lot more) 
 If you're looking for work in New Hampshire, I recommend the  NHJobsList  Yahoo Group: http://www.nhjobslist.com/ "NH Jobs List is a mailing list focused solely on jobs in New Hampshire." (If you sign up, you will be on the e-mail list for any NH job; several technical writing-related jobs come through each month. At the least, you may learn about a company in an industry you are interested in.) 
 Freelance Writing : http://www.freelancewriting.com/freelance-writing-jobs.php "Helping freelance writers to succeed since 1997." (e-mail list with helpful articles, tutorials, jobs, and links to writing contests). 
 This is one of several free infographics for writers from the site - a mind map for how a writer finds freelance work:

 Your help is great timing. I recently looked at outsource.com but after I filled out all the info, they wanted me to pay in order to send a quote to a prospective publication/employer. Doesn't seem right to me to pay to look for a job so I didn't do it. I 'm used to the employer paying the search agent, not the employee ( in this case the freelancer) Anyone else have similar experiences?

 This is great help. I've been having trouble trying to find freelance work for the purpose of building my copywriting portfolio. I currently have very little experience, so many people on these freelancing sites prefer people who have it. This seems to be the inevitable catch-22 of my life right now. I've also tried outsource.com and did not want to pay for bids. I am on upwork.com which doesn't require payment to bid on jobs, but I've had no real luck yet. I am also entering competitions that pay. The one I have had success with is copyshoppy.com. The only thing is, I am not sure how winning a couple of these can help add to my portfolio. I'm always looking for advice!
