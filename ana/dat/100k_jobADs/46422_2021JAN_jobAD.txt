 What is Howbout?   üéà 
 Howbout is a social planning app that modernises the calendar and the way you organise your social & personal life. It helps you instantly find a date you're all free, easily organise any in-person or virtual event and quickly manage everything you've got going on. 
 Following a really exciting 1st year - where we were downloaded 30,000 times, were featured 3x by Apple, helped users in >100 countries organise more than 700 events a day and got backing from a senior Snapchat exec - we're looking to grow our team and take Howbout to the next level. For more information about Howbout, check out our  website .

 Given our early stage, we're looking for someone with awesome communication skills, a strong work ethic, and the ability to work flexibly in an agile start-up environment

 Good understanding of how to communicate, create content for and market to millennials and Gen Z 
 A creative mind with critical thinking skills and the ability to understand and act upon user analysis 
 A strong work ethic and team player mentality 
 A quick learner who's up to date with social trends and ready to hit the ground running 
 A sense of humour - we don't take life too seriously and our brand tries to reflect this! 
 Prior experience and / or strong interest in technology or consumer startups 
 
 **What 's in it for you? ** üôå 
 
 Full-time leadership position at a high growth tech startup
