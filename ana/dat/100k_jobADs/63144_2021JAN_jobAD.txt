  Stick With Cool Internship or Take Paying Job?  
 Work It Daily 
 August 28, 2009 
 Dear Experts, I just graduated and have been looking all summer for a job. An internship opportunity came up that is incredibly cool - HOWEVER, it doesn't pay a dime. I accepted it and agreed to start in September. Since then, I got an interview and landed a job with a company this week. The job isn't very exciting and the pay is really low. So, I'm wondering, should I stick with the cool internship or take the paying job?  Here is how our T.A.P. experts answered this question:   Q#268  Sounds like the internship is in your field. Chance of FT later? Don't take job just b/c it's a job. ( @heatherhuhman )  Q#268  The internship is worth more in the long run. But if you need to get paid, there's no shame in the other job ( @gradversity )  Q#268  Intern v. paying job: If $ isnt the issue thn whichevr positions U better 4 mtng UR nxt career objective. ( @RTResumepro )  Q#268  It all depends on if you can survive without an income. Or U could take a PT job while interning. ( @beneubanks )  Q#268  U know answer in ur gut; do u need $? If not, give urself permission 2 follow heart. ( @juliaerickson )  Our Twitter Advice Project (T.A.P.) is no longer an active campaign.
