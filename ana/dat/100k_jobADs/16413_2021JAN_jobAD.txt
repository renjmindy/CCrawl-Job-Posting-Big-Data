 5 Reasons On-Job Employee Training Can Yield Better Results 
 __ September 12, 2014 __ Business ,  Employment  __ No Comments 
 There was a time when prospective employers went about their work like a mafia boss. They were a bunch of monopolistic people, and they would rule their domain ruthlessly. Today, however, things have changed ever since the competition in the corporate sector grew like a tumor. 
 More competition means employees now have to work extra hard for their employer to retain their repute and ensure professional growth. Regardless, working hard isn’t sufficient for one to observe a stead career growth and thus true professional success. The only way this goal can be achieved is through continuous learning. 
 Over the years, companies have realized that investing money on their employees is actually more fruitful than any other strategy. Hence, more and more companies are now training their employees with a view to encourage more productivity at  workplace. 
 Training does not only mean, giving a motivational speech, but it can widely vary from simple speeches to high-end workshops. The type of on-job training can also greatly depend on the nature of job, ranging from safety tips for employees who work with chemicals or heavy equipment to communication tips for customer support. 
 LOW RATE OF TURNOVER: 
 Management gurus have found that some employee, who are not given on-job training or workshop facilities, feel they are not wanted. Employees like it when the company shows interest in them, they feel like a family. According to  research , trained employees are more committed to serving their employer than the ones who are not trained. 
 Turnover rate is a very effective tool to measure the culture and environment of a particular company in that a high turnover rate gives a murky image to the company. Companies think that a high turnover means a low salary. However, it mostly means that the management is not interested in the employees. Targeted training for employees on a per annum basis can show them that managers care for them. 
 INCREASE IN PRODUCTIVITY: 
 It is quite obvious that every time a person is taught something, he performs that task in a much better way than before. Training too can help instill practices and beliefs in a person, based on which he can achieve more at his workplace. Training employees basically sharpens their skills and prepares them for more challenging tasks. 
 BOOSTS CONFIDENCE: 
 Training boosts confidence among employees, because training not only gives them the feeling that they are important for the company, but also for its business and future growth. 
 KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER: 
 Training is essential for knowledge transfer. It happens a lot that one employee who knows more than his colleague leaves the company, the company will have to hunt for someone who has the skills. This might delay work. In order to avoid such mishaps, it is better to train the remaining workforce. 
 TRAINING ADDS FLEXIBILITY AND EFFICIENCY: 
 Training employees can create a flexible workforce. Employees can be cross trained in sales, customer services as well as operations. This will help companies manage a flexible workforce that can easily be rotated around the company. 
 This is especially useful in case where one employee leaves the company and someone else from the workforce is needed to replace him. Companies like Google, have a flexible workforce and a flexible culture. This helps in employees being more happy and alert at work. 
 The reason why training has been so fruitful for so many companies, especially the multinational organizations, is because training gives the notion to employees that their employer is interested in their well being and improvement. 
 Training and upgrading employee skills is a far better investment than outsourcing or hiring new employees. Employees are a very important asset for the company. The happier, informed and relaxed a workforce will be, the better it will be for the company. 
 Training is also effective in allowing the employees to network. It allows employees to make new contacts with other participants of the training program; this is beneficial for the employer because these contacts can help in company’s growth later on.
