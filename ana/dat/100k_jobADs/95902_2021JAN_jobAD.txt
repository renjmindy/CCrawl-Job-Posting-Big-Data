 Book Resources 
 The following resources are linked to my e-book  How to Become a Traveling Librarian . Combined with the resources listed on the  International Librarianship  section of my website, they are a compilation of all I have learned in my 20+ years of following the ever-expanding field of international librarianship. 
 FYI: the book is currently only available as an e-book in Amazon. If you do not own a Kindle, you can download a free  Kindle Reading App  and read it on your computer or you can download  Calibre , a free program which will convert the mobi file to an epub file and allow you to read it on the iPad or Nook.
