 Job 
 Pizza & Perfume = üòê 
 When I was 16 years old, I worked at Round Table. 
When my shift was done, I changed back to my real close; but I still kind of smelled like pizza sauce. So I sprayed Ralph Lauren perfume, and no more pizza smell on me! ‚Ä¶ Then 5 minutes later, my close smelled like Ralph Lauren AND pizza again üòê 
 Someone actually posted this on ebay: 
 (Vintage) "Lauren by Ralph Lauren, 1 fl/oz Bottle,  Approximately 1/2 Full " 
 (?!?! -- Who would buy this half empty perfume bottle?) 
 Maybe she works at Round Table, and she knew that Ralph Lauren doesn't hide pizza smell too? 
 Hmmmmmm ‚Ä¶

 Dear President (again) 
 üìÑüìûüëç 
 (Update): 
 Dear President Donald Trump, 
 **I hear you need a new Nation Security Adviser -- oh I meant ** Attorney General   ! You‚Äôre in luck! I would be a great   Attorney General   . 
 Actually, I really don‚Äôt know much about what   Attorney General   (much less Nation Security Adviser) does. I was a copywriter in advertising. But like you, I watch TV news and regular shows. I didn‚Äôt watch  **  The Apprentice **  (sorry). However, I‚Äôve never gotten fired from my real job, so that‚Äôs a plus don‚Äôt you think? 
 **I didn‚Äôt vote for you, but unlike Michael Flynn  and  ** Jeff Sessions   , I‚Äôve never lied. Well, I once stole a candy bar when I was 9 years old. But someone saw what I did (it was my Dad) so I had to go back to the store and tell the manager what I did. She was mad at me, but she just warned me to never do it again. Thankfully, I‚Äôve learned my lesson! 
 Anyway, let me know when I can start the job. Thanks! 
 Sincerely, 
 Maureen Twomey

 Dear President Donald Trump, 
 I hear you need a new nation security adviser. You‚Äôre in luck! I would be a great nation security adviser. 
 Actually, I really don 't know much about what nation security adviser does. I was a copywriter in advertising. But like you, I watch TV news and regular shows. I didn‚Äôt watch  The Apprentice  (sorry). However, I‚Äôve never gotten fired from my real job, so that‚Äôs a plus don‚Äôt you think? 
 I didn‚Äôt vote for you, but unlike Michael Flynn, I‚Äôve never lied. Well, I once stole a candy bar when I was 9 years old. But someone saw what I did (it was my D   ad) so I had to go back to the store and tell the manager what I did. She was mad at me, but she just warned me to never do it again. Thankfully, I‚Äôve learned my lesson! 
 Anyway, let me know when I can start the job. Thanks!
