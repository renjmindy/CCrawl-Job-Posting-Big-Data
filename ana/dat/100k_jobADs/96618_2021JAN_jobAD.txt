 So this morning, on the way to work, I royally ticked off a fellow commuter when I came to a complete stop in front of him…at a red light. He gestured widely with his mouth agape at my audacity. I waved over my shoulder at the red light. He waved at me with one finger. I waved back…with all my fingers. Seriously, it was a bouquet of fingers! 
 This guy was not the worst guy I encountered this week… 
 Sunday afternoon my cell phone started making phaser noises like the Federation was under attack, and I jokingly said, "maybe my cell phone # is in another porn ad".

 Oh Snap!! Sometimes I hate it when I'm right… 
 I have been extremely popular this week, at all hours of the day and night. And not in a good way. 
 When this happened  last October , the ad offered "massages". This time, the ad is…less clear. Most texts are just " Hey baby, are you free?". Only one really tipped the scale on the Creepometer. 
 I was laughing about it with Little Guy the other day, and I pointed out that the ad couldn't be more wrong about me. I'm not young, Japanese or cheap, but at least they got lady part right. He pipes up…"you're not a lady either". Good job, buddy!

 (I wonder who taught him sarcasm?) 
 I may have joked about wearing "hooker" boots and have been known to make comments that were seriously  misinterpreted . This career opportunity may have appeared unexpectedly…  again  , and I may have more ambition than to be the  Gatekeeper in the Cubicle of Purgatory  for the rest of my working life. But even so - pass. 
 
 Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. Three times is enemy action. - Ian Fleming 
 
 Happy Weekend!

 Loved this post and enjoyed the "Church Lady" post AGAIN! Your brand of humor (and sarcasm) is my cup of tea, Jenn.
