  5 Job Options For Military Veterans  
 Amanda Green 
 June 11, 2014 
 It’s not unusual for military veterans to go into law enforcement. In fact, many find it to be a natural transition. Not only does the military and law enforcement require similar skill sets, many law enforcement agencies also offer  partial retirement credit  to veterans. This means that a veteran who left the military after 10 years--and is ineligible for military retirement benefits--could become a police officer and apply his military time toward his retirement.  Related: 10 Helpful Job Search Resources For Veterans  While law enforcement is attractive to many vets, there are some who prefer a different path. Here are some other job options for those individuals: 
 
 1. Information Technology 
 Thanks to the rapidly increasing use of technology in the military, many veterans have extensive training in the IT field. Whether the vet has experience with technical and equipment support, data management and processing, network administration, programming or software development, companies are looking for qualified candidates in all fields. Some companies, like Intel for instance, even have recruitment programs specifically geared toward veterans, which are designed to help them find the jobs that make the most of their skills. 
 2. Training and Development 
 The same problem-solving and crisis management skills used in a military setting come into play in training and development. In fact, many companies also prefer veterans for the leadership and work ethic they bring to the table. 
 3. Manufacturing, Industrial, And Construction 
 Manufacturing, industrial and construction have all become crucial parts of the economic recovery in the United States. In an effort to employ more veterans, many of the top manufacturing and industrial companies started the “Get Skills to Work Coalition,” specifically to help veterans find work in those sectors. The manufacturing and industrial jobs aren’t restricted solely to the factory floor; they also include positions in engineering and management. In the construction sector, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been a major force in hiring and placing veterans. 
 4. Administrative Services 
 Many veterans can excel in administrative positions, especially with companies and organizations that provide services to other veterans. For example, a veteran working for a mortgage provider like  Lowvarates.com , that focus' specifically on veteran services, can help other veterans through the process of qualifying and applying for VA loans. A veteran working as a school administrator can help fellow vets apply for GI Bill benefits. 
 5. Transportation 
 The transportation field is broad and includes a variety of jobs, including train engineers, airline pilots, cruise ship captains, and long-haul truck drivers. In fact, in 2012 the U.S. Department of Transportation revealed a plan to  hire 5,000 veterans  with 500 rail companies across the nation. The rail industry isn’t the only one stepping up. Veterans can also find jobs in transportation and logistics through the Troops to Transportation and Logistics program sponsored by Corporate America Supports You. These are but a few of the possible career paths available to veterans. While law enforcement remains the most popular option for many, it’s not the only option. Veterans can find several options by searching federal job sites, like USAJobs, or by contacting some of the companies and organizations mentioned in this article.
