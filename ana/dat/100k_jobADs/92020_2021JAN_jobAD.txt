 Coach Profile 
 Lyne Tumlinson, PCC, CAE, CPBSCAE 
 How will clients benefit with you as their coach? 
 I help small business and association leaders transform managers into leaders and work groups into powerful teams. 
 What is your coaching philosophy? 
 I dream of a world where people are excited to go to work with purpose, jumping out of bed thinking, "Thank you, God, it's morning!" instead of, "Oh Gawd, it's morning." I work with association leaders who are sick and tired of wonky team dynamics and drama, to find their authentic voice and blend their best gifts for amazing and fun teamwork. 
 What types of clients do you work with? 
 Small business and association leaders. 
 What is your professional background? 
 I am the Founder and Team Leadership Coach at Lift Team Coaching and focus on helping other connect using their strengths and developing teams of empowered leaders to step up to offer specific value to their organizations and all stakeholders. My background in personality, cultural diversity, and leadership development has been a perfect storm of preparation for this calling. I implement my team coaching serving as choir director, aspiring to share hymns both sing-able and presented with harmonious blend ed harmony, like a high-performing team. That requires attention to each singer's uniqueness â€“ as to where they stand, their tempo and dynamics, voice tone and part. 
 I am a Professional Certified Coach with (ICF) the International Coach Federation, holding additional certifications from People Acuity (a Strengths Strategy company) and Reach Personal Branding; along with training in Advanced Group & Team Coaching from inviteChange (coaching and coach training company). I earned my CAE designation during my eight-year tenure with the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America, that included five years as Director of Career Services. I earned an MA from the University of Kansas and has studied Psychology, Business, and Russian studies.
