 Role overview 
 In a paediatric intensive care nurse role, the NICU RN provides care for children and adolescents, usually up to the age of 18, with life-threatening or high-acuity conditions that require constant monitoring. Working in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU), a high-tech children’s services area for critically ill, medically complex and/or post-surgical patients, paediatric intensive care nursing jobs also involve collaboration with families, physicians and other healthcare professionals or clinicians to determine the best course of patient care and recovery. 
 Required Qualifications 
 Nurses interested in pursuing a NICU Registered Nurse job must have completed a four-year course of instruction at an accredited university, or have earned an associate of nursing degree from a two-year community college followed by a diploma program at a healthcare facility. In addition, according to our partner NurseZone, many facilities require additional paediatric education and support (PEDS) training.
