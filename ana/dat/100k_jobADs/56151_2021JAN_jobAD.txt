 Getting Better Response And Spending Less On Jobboards 
 Posted  by   @BillBoorman  on   August 1, 2012  in  Recruiting 
 Lets be honest about this, job boards aren't dead, and are showing no sign of passing on any time soon. LinkedIn is not a job board, it's a place you can post jobs with other content. Facebook are so keen on the job board concept that they want to build their own of sorts. as discussed in my last post. Recruiters love job boards because for the most part, the candidates that come from them are low hanging fruit and easier to convert to hires. Posting to a job board is the default process for most recruiters, especially in the agency world, it's often automated through job posting tools before any search takes place. Post and pray is alive and well! 
 Last week I worked with a team of agency recruiters on what they were spending, and how they could reduce their spend whilst increasing the quality of the response. for most recruiters, advertising is an after thought and mostly a cut and paste job description. A job description is rarely a sales document. It's a list of duties and what the hiring company is looking for, and not what the company can offer. They are often full of general statements, like "good team-player" rather than anything specific that is of use to job seekers. What I'm seeing from all the research in this area is that potential candidates are worn out by the application process, getting no feedback and the like. They are only applying for jobs where they think they have a good chance of getting an interview. This means that the skills required need to be clear and the top text. Ads that look like fishing ads with multiple locations are really a waste of money, the job must look real and not a CV collection point. 
 It is important to remember that you are not writing for a print media ad. A creative job title or over worded content just won't get eyes. There are 4 challenges to consider when crafting your ad: 
 > Being found 
 This means coming up top in searches when job seekers enter their searches. Before writing your text, check what the competition is posting. Consider what you would set as the search parameters if you were the job seeker. The jobs that come out at the top will show the number of times the keywords have been used. You need to go one better. It is not about keyword stuffing though, repeated key words need to be in context. 
 > Being found by the right people 
 It's not just about being found, it's more important to be found by the right people. this means doing a little research. This means adding specific skills as keywords in your text and title. this might cut down the volume of response, but it will get the right people applying. Most job boards will provide you with response data. Monitor the ratio of views to applies to see if you are converting the people who are looking at your ad in to applicants. If the ratio is low, you are either getting found by the wrong people or the job is being presented in the wrong way. Monitor all your views, response, interviews and hires so that you can constantly look at ways of improving what you do. 
 > Selling the opportunity 
 Consider what would make you apply. Your job needs to hit the spot ahead of your competition, which means selling what is in it for them before listing duties etc. Top text is what you are looking for (specifics), second text is what you can offer in real terms and specifics. Why should someone want your job over your competitors? 
 > Jobs by e-mail 
 This is massively overlooked but is a critical area. Most job seekers don't visit the board on a daily basis in the hope that a new job has popped up, but register, upload a CV and sign up for jobs by e-mail. That means that the right people are likely to see your job by e-mail. 
 
 Do you know what the jobs look like when they get mailed to applicants? sign up for a few because this is how your jobs are going to be delivered. 
 
 
 Think title. If your title is the same as everyone else's then it is not going to stand out. including a location will help with this, as well as salary. Most jobs by e-mail show title only, and this is what is going to either get people to click on the link or move on. 
 
 Keeping your ads current keep them top of the listings. It is worth advertising fewer jobs and refreshing more often, people search most current jobs from the last few days first, and if they find what they want then they are unlikely to look further. By spending time on your ads, using the CV database to understand which job boards are best for your target audience and using keywords to get found will help you get the right eyes to your ad, once they are there, it's appealing copy that gets results, and it pays to back this up with plenty of social content for people who like to check out opportunities before hitting apply. A strategy of making sure your employer brand content is aligned with your job advertising will get the two content places working in unison. 
 Good luck!

 Bill, a fabulous piece, which neatly reiterates what I tell my clients - often falling on deaf ears - on a daily basis. Write better copy and you will receive more, better qualified, applications. Easy. So you'd think…

 The intrinsic value of thoughtful job board postings will absolutely capture quality (not necessarily quantity) candidates …you made that fact crystal clear! The more appealing the opportunity the greater chance of visibility and positive response by the highest caliber candidates has been my experience.

 Hello, I think your blog might be having browser compatibility issues. 
When I look at your blog site in Ie, it looks fine but when opening in Internet Explorer, it has some overlapping. 
I just wanted to give you a quick heads up! 
Other then that, terrific blog!
