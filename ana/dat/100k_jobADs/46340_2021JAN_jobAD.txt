 New job! 
 Posted by  gwenix

 As most of you may know, I started a new job a few weeks ago. What you may not know is the story behind getting this job. 
 While I was taking time off between jobs, I found out that GitHub was looking for volunteers for RailsConf. I signed up, and for a few hours of volunteer work on the first day, I got a free ticket. I knew that I was going to this event, not knowing Ruby or Rails, with the aim of learning new things and shaking hands. And that is exactly what happened. 
 However, the fun part was during a break in sessions, we were all given cheesecake to enjoy during a bit of a social hour. I sat down at a table and introduced myself to the folks there. At this point, it was just for social reasons, I was trying to do all my hand shaking at the vendor booths. 
 One of the guys at the table was a really nice guy I talked to for a long while. As we got up and exchanged business cards, I found out he's the VP of Engineering at his company. Wow! I had no idea! He did email me the following week asking me to interview there as well, and … well .. he is now my boss. 
 I am now officially a DevOps Engineer, and I really like all of the people I am working with at this new job. So -- the risk I took in quitting the last job worked out. 
 I am counting my lucky stars on this.
