 ü§ñ  Why we do what we do 
 When we founded Massive Miniteam all we wanted was a nice and stable work environment. For us that meant being happy and healthy while working on exciting projects. Today we are fortunate to share this vision with our ever growing team. 
 We value good communication, inclusivity and professionaism. We want to ensure that everyone feels comfortable and respected so that they have space and time to grow. To work with us means to join a kind and generally lighthearted environment and always be confronted with new and exciting tasks to tackle. 
 ‚Äç 
 üëæ  What we do 
 Very early on we realized that being financially stable as a young game studio meant that we needed a steady income without relying on successful game releases. Putting our tech industry experience to use, we started working for clients in the field of automotive, e-learning, VR and AR. This strategy gave us the opportunity to grow and develop Spitlings our first own game. Spitlings was released in 2020 and is available on all major gaming platforms. 
 Our experience developing for consoles gives us the opportunity to work with a lot of interesting companies and to help them port their games to many different platforms. 
 Today we mainly work on game projects with a small part of the team doing contract work and porting. We have a few exciting game projects we are currently working on and a lot more coming in the future. We would love to share more with you in an interview.
