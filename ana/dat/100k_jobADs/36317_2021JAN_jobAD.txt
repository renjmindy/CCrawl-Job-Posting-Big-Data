  5 Tips For A Safe Online Job Search  
 Teena Rose 
 May 20, 2013 
 Think you're safe conducting a  safe job search online ? Think again. Conducting a job search using the Internet has definitely transformed how job seekers contact hiring companies. The availability of copying and pasting a text version resume into a form at a company’s website (or uploading a Word file) has laid the foundation for an easier and more convenient job search process. No longer does a job seeker need to spend hours with the traditional method of printing and mailing his resume to countless recipients. With the Internet’s convenience, a breeding ground for scam artists continues to grow each year as well. Identity thefts increased to an overwhelming 10 million cases in 2008 and another 11 million more for 2009. Many of these cases are the result of phishing — so not surprisingly, the employment industry is under attack as well. The FTC reports approximately 12% of total fraud involves employment fraud. Phishing is an attempt to extract personal information through what appears to be authentic e-mails. If you are job searching, an e-mail from a seemingly interested recruiter, for example, may not raise a red flag with you. You may think the contact person and company listed are legitimate. Yet, looks can be deceiving. Knowing what to look for and how to spot fraud (or potential for abuse) can be the best deterrent to ensuring you have a safe experience, while conducting your job search. 
 
 Be Leery Of Submission Invitations 
 Scammers and spammers follow much the same patterns. Mass e-mails are sent to an enormous list of recipients. Not everyone on the “hit list” is searching for a new job; however, only a small number of people need to be convinced or tricked into believing the e-mail is authentic in order for the scam to be deemed successful. Receiving an e-mail from a recruiter who states, “We saw your resume on the Internet, and we find your skill set to be perfect for one of our clients. Please complete our online application through the below link.” Should this happen to you, ponder a series of questions: 
 
 Did you send your resume to this recruiter? 
 If not, how did the company learn about you (legitimate e-mails should tell you)? Just mentioning, “Saw your resume on the Internet,” is vague. 
 Upon further examination, do the company and the company rep appear reputable? 
 
 Visit the company’s website (caution: type the web address into your browser, avoid clicking the link in the e-mail). If you’re still unable to determine the validity of the request, call the company. Verify everything; sender’s name, e-mail address, and so on. Still avoid clicking the link in the e-mail... it’s just a good habit to start! Always proceed with suspicion when you receive any cold-contact e-mail from someone. 
 Avoid Responding To Requests For Personal Information 
 Let’s say you receive an e-mail from what appears to be a well-known job bank. The e-mail states your account needs your contact and payment information to be updated in order for service renewal. You click on the link and you’re taken to a page that looks, feels, and “smells” right. You then proceed by submitting the requested information. The link appeared safe, but you were taken to a site designed to defraud you. 
 Make Sure The Webpage Is Encrypted 
 When using a paid resume submission service, or any other service for that matter, ensure the private information you provide is encrypted upon hitting submit. Encryption, in short, ensures the private information you submit online is kept safe. When at your browser, you can recognize an encrypted form when the root URL starts with “https:” instead of “http:” or you see the padlock present in the bottom right corner of your screen. Purchasing from companies having added security measures in place can ensure your private information avoids the hands of ill-willed people. Learn more about encryption by reading Jeff Tyson’s article titled, “How Encryption Works,” at www.howstuffworks.com. 
 Read And Understand The Privacy Policy Of Sites You Patron 
 The Better Business Bureau possesses a strict policy for members who do business online. A privacy statement for example must be displayed on member’s website, no exceptions. High business practices are a necessity for maintaining the trust of online buyers; and the BBB understands the critical importance of trust among consumers. A privacy statement outlines what type of customer information is collected and how it’s used. Information transferred or sold could be basic, like name and e-mail address, or far more in-depth like name, address, social security number, and phone number. No matter how basic or detailed the information, the company must have the logistics spelled out in their privacy policy, so you can make the decision whether to patron the site in the first place. 
 Tell... Because So Few Others Do 
 Reports show a staggering 80% of online fraud goes unreported. If the proper authorities aren’t aware of the magnitude of fraud that actually exists on the Internet, then getting the much-needed funds to battle the problem will take more time. The  Internet Fraud Complaint Center  has an online complaint feature for individuals to report phishing attacks. The IFCC report process requires basic information, including information on the perpetrator and type of fraud. For phishing schemes, forward the fraudulent e-mail to the legitimate company in addition to filing a formal complaint with IFCC. Phishing is smearing the good names of countless companies, and notifying the company about the scam can also help the fight. Bringing affected companies on board early will provide a multi-prong approach to this epidemic. The lesson job seekers should learn is to avoid giving your information out freely. Whether you’re at the end of a phishing attack or the job application requires more information than you’re willing to provide, proceed with caution. Much like you’ll analyze job opportunities; intensely examine each person who receives your personal information. With safe online practices, you’ll get the best return from your  job search efforts  — instead of spending hours filing a police report and calling credit bureaus and credit card companies.
