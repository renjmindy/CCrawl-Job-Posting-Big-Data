 Farmer to Rocket Scientist. The Kingdom and You. — letters to a modern-day Job

 I suddenly shuddered. I realized that if I had got my hands “bloody” and won the battle at my former workplace, I would have totally missed out on something so much better! Then I realized that the colleague that stayed behind is actually the one digging for scraps because my old company does not pay well. I realized that by “losing” I won, and him “winning” he actually lost. Such is how the Kingdom works. Matthew 19:30 says “But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.”
