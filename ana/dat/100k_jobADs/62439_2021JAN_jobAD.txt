 Online Content Manager 
 Job description 
 Analyst Technical Content (Technical Writer) 
 Rio Tinto has a long history filled with firsts. They have developed some of the world's largest and best quality mines and operations, and have people working in 35 countries across six continents. Aluminium and copper, diamonds, gold and industrial minerals, iron ore, coal, and uranium: their materials make up the world around us. 
 About the Role 
 Rio Tinto Rail Operations is currently seeking an Analyst Technical Content to focus on content management. This role is based at the Rio Tinto operations centre at Perth Airport, Monday to Friday, working an on-going contract within the Rail Governance team. 
 This opportunity is suited to a Writer who would like to branch into content management. Training in Rio Tinto management systems and processes will be provided. The role is largely focussed on managing changes to existing content (corporate procedures and manuals) and as such there is a heavy HTML exposure. The nature of the work follows repetitive process cycles, and this calls for someone who is comfortable with complex computer-based operations of a repetitive nature. 
 As the Analyst for Technical Content, you will be maintaining content in HTML5 and Microsoft Word format using MadCap Flare as the content management system. The content is managed using single-sourcing principles and read by our customers using several systems and mediums. While previous experience in Flare, or a similar tool, is an advantage, it is not essential. 
 This position would suit a technical writer who is organised, methodical, able to troubleshoot, and accustomed to working to strict deadlines. 
 You will be responsible for: 
 
 
 Transitioning, maintaining, and retiring controlled document content for rail in consultation with the business, subject matter experts and authors and in-line with Rail Governance processes 
 
 
 Using and updating the document management system 
 
 
 Participating in and contributing to Rail Governance meetings, discussions, and workshops 
 
 
 Applying continuous improvement methods with respect to Rail controlled document content and processes. 
 
 
 Project support as required for the Rail Governance team. 
 
 
 You will be a great candidate if this sounds like you: 
 
 
 If the Rio Tinto Values of Safety, Teamwork, Respect, Integrity and Excellence resonate with you and you have good relationship building skills. 
 
 
 You must demonstrate an established interest in and commitment to a writing discipline, e.g., Technical Writers, web content managers, etc. 
 
 
 Can demonstrate skills in HTML code writing; and 
 
 
 You should have post-secondary education or equivalent in a writing-related area, e.g., English qualification, document writing training, writing professional, etc.
