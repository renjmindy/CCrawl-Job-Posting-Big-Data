 Description 
 Currently, I'm doing import business with China in Japan. 
I want to expand my business to Southeast Asia this time, so I am looking for a partner. 
I would like to purchase at Shopee, but I do not support shipping to Japan. 
 So,I wanna request you that written under sentence. 
 I buy goods with my money (electronic money). 
↓ 
Send it to your address. Weigh your luggage and send a photo of mesure. 
↓ 
Send you shipping to Japan (electronic money) Take out your parcel at the post office 
 That's all there is to it. I can understand English, so I don't think it's a problem at all. 
Below are the requirements for our partners. 
 ● Be fluent in English 
● I have an electronic money account (Paypal is preferable, but others are also possible) 
● The distance is such that you can carry your luggage (about 5 kg) to the post office. 
●If possible, it's best to live near an urban area (because many Shopee stores support urban areas).
