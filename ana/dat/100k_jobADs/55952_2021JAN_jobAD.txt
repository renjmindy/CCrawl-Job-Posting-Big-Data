 Hot Damn! it's a Full-time job 
 Carta is looking for a Senior Design Technologist in San Francisco, CA, USA. 
 About 
 The Team You’ll Work With: 
 The Web Presence team at Carta is a creative group of interactive, visual designers, design technologists and engineers - and we’re just getting started! We are building a design system for carta.com that brings equity and ownership to life. We nurture a creative team environment that promotes taking risks and being bold. We measure success not by pages or features shipped, but rather by the impact we drive for the business. 
 The Problems You’ll Solve: 
 We are developing Carta’s Web Presence experience to be the best one-stop-shop for all things equity. We are looking for a Senior Visual Design Technologist to scale and build the Web Presence System at Carta. You will establish rules for creating a scalable design system, to which others will contribute. You’ll build new components, use those components to build entire web pages and often incorporate animations. You care as much about responsive design as you do about web accessibility, SEO, and performance. You will help debug problems if they arise, traversing all layers of the web application to understand it fully. You’ll coordinate with our product design team to align on brand identity and product development.
