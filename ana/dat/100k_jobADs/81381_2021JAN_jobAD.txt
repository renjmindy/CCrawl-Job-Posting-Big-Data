 I don't fit in ,  mindfulness ,  Stories we Live 
 "I'm not creative enough" is a lie 
 December 5, 2017   Mairead 
 Mindfulness can help us become the unbiased observer and see the truth that there isn’t a right size or a wrong size; there isn’t a right career or a wrong career; there isn’t a right opinion or a wrong opinion; there isn’t a right lifestyle or a wrong lifestyle. As an unbiased observer we can make up the story we want to be living.
