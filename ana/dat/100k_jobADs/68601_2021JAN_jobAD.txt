 What are the Online Jobs? Online jobs are the jobs where you can work online from your home or from any other place. Till now you must have seen lots of online jobs ads but still not able to find a suitable genuine online jobs. 
 Part Time jobs, Data entry jobs, Envelope Staffing Jobs,   Earn millions in a month  all this type of ad which are in short don’t provide much details other than the telephone number, you call and you get to know that you have to pay registration fees all these are bogus. 
 Never pay any amount to get the online jobs. Keep in mind in any online job you are not going to earn six figure amount within a month. 
 You might be wondering really people earn money through online. 
 Online you can work as data entry, virtual assistant, HR Assistant, Travel Assistant, Customer Care, Online Marketing, Medical Transcription and as many more which related online. 
 So today we are providing here some useful tips to find suitable online jobs. 
 Tip#1 . The first tip is to use proper keywords like Work from home jobs or Work at Home or Online Jobs or freelance jobs or freelancing jobs or any other related keywords in popular search engine like Google you will get lots of results. But in all that results you have to find the legitimate jobs because 90% of the sites are not trusted. One of the criteria to identify is teh site does not ask for registration fee. Check one such website from this link  http://moneyconnexion.com/top-20-hottest-online-jobs.htm  & find dozens of legitimate online jobs for free. 
 Tip#2 . You can also use keywords like Data Entry, Virtual Assistant etc as per your job profile and then you can look for the online jobs category or you can ask directly the company if they can offer you to work from home. One of the top company that provide data entry job is iGate. You can check Google to find the data entry jobs from iGate. 
 Tip#3 . Now a days everything is getting online all the big companies, small companies, sole proprietor, freelancers are online and many of them are hiring freelancer or giving the option to work from home. Try to find these companies which are providing online jobs or allowing to work from home. 
 Tip#4 . There are also some Indian online companies who provide the online jobs where they don’t have any employee all are the freelancers. 
 Tip#5 . Create a profile on websites like Naukri.com, MonsterIndia.com, now you will think these Job sites provide only the office based jobs. No, there are online jobs also on these job sites. Many of them are legitimate, but you have to make sure before you start working. Even you can find here some big companies also who provide online jobs. Make a different profile for the online job search, use online job keywords. 
 Tip#6 . Register on websites which provide freelancing work like Elance.com, Guru.com, Worknhire.com etc. Create a profile as per your skills and bid for the project on these websites. On these websites there are many vendors from all over the world who are offering the freelancing work and there many freelancer who on daily basis bid on the project. 
 Tip#7 . Even on local classifieds you can find the online jobs but as above said you have to verify the genuine one. 
 Tip#8 . Think what do you want to do? What is your job profile and what kind of work you can do online? Once it is clear you can concentrate on one job profile instead of looking for various online jobs and getting confused. 
 Tip#9 . Sign up with social networking site like LinkedIn where people are getting connected for job opportunities and employers are looking for the right candidate, here through the network you can find out who is offering online jobs. 
 Tip#10 . If any of your friend or relative is having small business or working as a freelancer you can ask them also for the online job. Even if now they don’t have the extra work but if in future if they want to hire any person then definitely they will think about you first. 
 Tip#11 . The last tip for all those currently employed persons are ask your employer if they can offer you to work from home. But here job profile should like you can online no need to go office on daily basis. Your boss may agree if you try to convince them why you are looking for work from home option. 
 At last I can say even though if you find a genuine work get more details about the client before you start. As you will work for whole month or on whole project and at last you may not get the payment nor the client will reply as other than the mobile number and email id you don’t have any other contact details. Many must have faced this situation so do a proper research before you start working with any firm.
