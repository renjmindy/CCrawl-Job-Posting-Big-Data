 Gaming is the biggest vertical in the global media and entertainment industry; much bigger than filmmaking. Gaming attracts millions of fans and has players hooked to their screens with exhilarating entertainment even as technology pushes the envelope allowing for more thrilling and immersive experiences. Gaming studios with their talented teams comprising creative and technical talent, both in-house as well as freelance, are rewriting the rules of the game to meet the explosive demand for experiential excitement. Some of the best studios in the business are employing game developers and  freelance gaming  experts to create bestsellers with the potential to rock the entertainment world. 
 Game producers are employing blended teams to access the best gaming talent and inspire them to collaborate on superior gaming experiences. As new formats, platforms, and technologies revolutionize the game and intensify the already challenging environment of the fiercely competitive yet staggeringly remunerative gaming industry, talent is in hot demand as a flurry of game design jobs and  freelance game developer jobs  clutter the job market. 
 What’s more, with the industry witnessing a shift to a blended workforce model, opportunities are growing fast for freelancers. Studios are adjusting to the new order and reworking their project briefing, planning, and execution models to ensure that their in-house teams and freelancers work in tandem to achieve project goals. Whether one is a  freelance game developer , game play tester, or a game designer, the fact is that gaming freelancers are in high demand with plenty of opportunities coming their way.
