 The Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics (WIAS) is an institute of the Forschungsverbund Berlin e.V. (FVB). The FVB comprises eight non-university research institutes in Berlin which are funded by the federal and state governments. The research institutes are members of the Leibniz Association. 
 WIAS invites in the Research Group 
 " Nonsmooth   Variational Problems and Operator Equations " 
 (Head: Prof. Dr. M. Hintermuller) applications for a 
 Research Assistant Position (f/m/d) 
 (  Ref. 20/27  ). 
 to be filled at  the earliest possible date   .  The position is associated with the research project 
 "   Equilibria for Energy Markets with Transport" 
 within the Berlin Mathematics Research Center MATH+. 
 The purpose of the position is to carry out research in the field of modeling, analytic, optimization and numerical aspects of generalized Nash equilibrium problems with partial differential equation constraints. The position offers the possibility to do a doctorate (PhD). 
 Requirements:  A completed university degree in mathematics or a related discipline (preferably with very good results); Knowledge of partial differential equations, continuous optimization and applied functional analysis; Experience in the field of numerical and computer-aided implementation; a high proficiency in spoken and written English. 
 More information can be found under  http://www.mathplus.de/  or  http://wias-berlin.de/people/hintermueller/ . 
 The position is remunerated according to TVoD and is initially limited to two years. 
 The Institute aims to increase the proportion of women in this field, so applications from women are particularly welcome. Among equally qualified applicants, disabled candidates will be given preference. 
 Please upload your complete application documents, including cover letter, curriculum vitae and certificates, via our    applicant portal  until  December 31st, 2020  using the button " Apply online ". 
 We are looking forward to your application!
