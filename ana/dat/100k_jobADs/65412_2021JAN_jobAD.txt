  How To Manage Career Uncertainty  
 Aaron Sanborn 
 January 13, 2021 
   
 In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic greatly disrupted the economy and resulted in layoffs at multiple businesses. 
 It also served as a reminder to professionals that your employment status can change in an instant. 
 No matter how established and comfortable you are in your career, uncertainty can always be around the corner and there are things that you can do to prepare yourself for these situations. 
 Be Honest With Yourself 
 From time to time, it's important to ask yourself,  "Am I happy with my career?" The answer to this question tells you whether you should be building a  career plan  strategy for your current profession, or if you need to shift gears and get yourself ready for a career change. Every job is temporary! People change, businesses change, and obviously the economy is always changing. The key is to have a good idea of the direction that you want to go in if you find yourself dealing with a job loss. Do you want to continue down a similar career path, or make a change? 
 Make Yourself An Indispensable Employee 
 One of the most consistent pieces of advice that we give at Work It Daily is the importance of showing value at your job. Employees who consistently find ways to save or make the company money have a way of making  themselves indispensable . But beyond that, showing a strong work ethic and commitment to your job are all traits that employers value, and they help you build a reputation as an exceptional employee. Even if the worst-case scenario occurred and you still lost your job at some point, all of these accomplishments and traits can be used to market yourself when you're hunting for a new job. Be sure to use numbers and statistics  on your resume to quantify  how you made your previous company more efficient and profitable, and keep in touch with former colleagues and supervisors who can vouch for you as a good employee. Making yourself indispensable may not work 100% of the time, but it's never a wasted effort because your accomplishments will speak for your work ethic and character, and will help you land on your feet. 
 Embrace Career Growth 
 It's important to be a lifelong learner, both in your professional and personal life. Professionally, while it's important to be in the present and focus on your core job responsibilities, it's also important to keep an eye towards the future and think about ways your role can expand. You sometimes hear stories about managers asking job candidates where they want to be in 10 years and the candidate answering  "I want your job!"  While this isn't the ideal way to answer this interview question, it's good to have that type of ambition. Career growth is a multi-step process that starts with excelling at your primary position and then taking on additional responsibilities. From there, it's about gaining the confidence to bring ideas to the table about expanding your role and then seeking  opportunities for promotion . Those who are willing to grow their careers position themselves well in times of uncertainty. But once again, if you do happen to lose your job, this willingness to learn will serve you well on the job search, and impress potential employers. Always be on the lookout for  ways to upskill . 
 Make A Career Change 
 If you're no longer happy with your career, chances are you aren't doing everything you need to do to grow it, and your job may be vulnerable in times of uncertainty. Making a change will not only be a good move for your own happiness, but it's also the better long-term career move. Sometimes career uncertainty and job loss is the push many professionals need to make a change.  Career change  isn't an easy process, but if you take some time to learn and commit to the process, it can be very rewarding. The good news is Work It Daily can help!

  How To Successfully Change Careers After A Layoff  
 Aaron Sanborn 
 December 04, 2020 
   
 For most workers, being laid off or furloughed is a scary thought, and unfortunately this scary thought became a reality for many professionals who had their jobs impacted by COVID-19. 
 However, for some, losing their job is the push they need to make a career change. 
 It's not as crazy as it sounds!  Some people need a change but are too afraid to make one, and losing their job is the perfect opportunity to do so. In addition, many workers who lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 crisis may find that it will be  difficult to get back into the industries  they were working in. Career change isn't easy, but with an organized approach, it can be done successfully. It won't happen overnight, but with patience and commitment, you can ultimately end up in a better place. Here's what you need to know about the career change process as you embark on the job hunt. 
 Commit To A Career Change Plan 
 Before committing to a career change, make sure you're ready to close the door on your current career. A career change should not be an impulse decision or strictly driven by the trauma of a layoff. So, it's important to take some time to really think things over. But, if your decision comes from a prolonged period of career unhappiness, then the time may be right. Identify the new industry that you're looking to get into and then create an  interview bucket list  of 10-12 companies where you would like to work. Take a self-inventory of yourself and identify the transferable skills you possess that would also apply well to this new industry. Identify where you need to upskill. What skills are you missing for this new position? Come up with a plan for gaining these skills. Attend training courses, workshops, classes, or certification opportunities. 
 Changing Careers Is About Who You Know 
 Now that you've drafted a career change plan, the real challenge begins: building your network. When applying to a new industry, it's not enough to just apply online and pray that you'll get an interview. You have to put the work in. Go to the company's website or LinkedIn account to identify the human resources manager and the company's key players. Try to make an actual connection. Tap into your current network to see if you already know someone working at the company or have a friend who does know a current employee. Use any connection you make to learn more about the company and to tell your career story, where you've been, and why you are choosing to change careers. Any connection that you make is a foot in the door. This is a much more efficient way to conduct a job search, rather than just applying for every online job posting (spray and pray). Most resumes don't even make it past the Applicant Tracking System (ATS). In addition to trying to secure an interview, putting in this work will also help you build networking skills and expand your professional network. No matter where you are in your career, it always pays to network. This would also be a good time to update your  LinkedIn profile , too. 
 Ease Your Way To Your Dream Job 
 What if you could get a job at the company you want to work for, just not at the position that you wanted? That would actually be a career victory. When it comes to career changes, very rarely can you just switch lanes and land your new dream job. Sometimes you need to ease your way in. If you're struggling to get the position you want within a certain company, research other positions inside that company to see if there are any positions that better fit into your current skill sets. If there is, apply for that position. That way you at least get a job at the company. From there, you can figure out a way to  gain the skills that you need , so that you can one day move into your dream position. 
 Beware! Career Changes Come With Salary Implications 
 This may be hard to believe, but when it comes to a career change, sometimes salary is the last thing that you think about. That's because the career change process is so involved. It takes a lot of effort to come up with a plan and eventually secure an interview. Salary considerations are something that get placed on the temporary back-burner.  But, if you've reached the point in the process where it's time to discuss salary, you've done something right and don't want things to unravel. Depending on the type of industry you're going into, you'll be looking at either a salary increase, decrease, or match. It's essential that you do your research about the position and the average salary for such a position in your geographical area. Websites such as  salary.com  and  glassdoor.com  can be good resources for this information. Having this information could be helpful in  salary negotiations , or at the very least mentally prepare you, particularly if you're facing a salary decrease. It's also important not to lie when asked about your current salary in order to get a higher salary. It never pays to be dishonest. Being laid off and then deciding to change careers is a lot to take on. If you're organized and committed, you can do it, but you don't have to do it alone!

In addition, Work It Daily has a number of other resources that can give you the added edge you need to make a successful career change, including our masterclass training  Laid Off & Looking .

  4 Signs You Chose The Wrong Career  
 Jan Felton 
 Aaron Sanborn 
 November 17, 2020 
   
 Choosing the wrong career path is a setback, but it's not an impossible setback to come back from. 
 The key is to realize that you've made a wrong decision, identify why it happened, and then put together a plan for moving forward. 
 Are you worried that you've chosen the wrong career, but aren't sure? Here are five signs that you have: 
 You're Not Enjoying Your Work 
 Those who achieve career success usually find their jobs personally fulfilling, and love to find ways to solve the challenges that come with the job. Remember, preferences are different for different people and therefore it would be stupid to choose a job just because others have had success with it. What you must do is  choose a career  that perfectly matches your aptitude and skills. Do not be pigeonholed into a specific career just because someone you know is happy in it, or you may end up frustrated. 
 You're Not Performing Well 
 The most important factor that determines one's career growth is work performance. Employees that find ways to save and make the company money tend to produce the most results and position  themselves for a promotion . But, if you find that your work performance is gradually degrading and your superiors are not happy with you, or if you can't come up with ways to improve your job performance, or are not enthusiastic about improving your performance, then it may be time for a career change. 
 You're Not Satisfied With Your Role 
 Even if you have senior status at work, you might still feel frustrated with your job responsibilities. Remember, job satisfaction is one of the key reasons behind constructing a successful career. If you're not satisfied with your job responsibilities, you could try to have a  career discussion with your boss  to see if there are opportunities to change some of your responsibilities. However, if you go this route, you need to bring some ideas to the table about changing your job responsibilities, and how it will benefit the company. If you can't do that, or are not enthusiastic about this opportunity, you might not be on the right career path. 
 You Have Lots Of Stress Or Anxiety 
 Stress and anxiety are common for almost everyone who works. However, if a stressful work environment goes on to affect one's health conditions drastically, he or she might want to consider a career change.  If you feel that stress and anxiety are affecting your mental peace at work, consider that it may be the wrong career option for you. Choosing the wrong career isn't something you should be ashamed of! It happens to a lot of people. Like with any mistake, it's important to learn from it, and apply those lessons to your efforts of choosing the right career. The thing that you could do is stay in a career that you're unhappy with. It not only stunts your career growth, but it negatively impacts your employer. Work It Daily can help you with your career change!

  How To Stand Out At A New Job (And Fit In Too)  
 Andria Corso 
 Aaron Sanborn 
 November 05, 2020 
   
 Congratulations! After months of job hunting, you finally got hired for the job you wanted! 
 Getting a new job is exciting. However, after the dust settles from celebrating this accomplishment, you have some work to do. 
 Being a new employee can be tough sometimes. But if you're ready to embrace the challenge, you can make a smooth career change. Here are a few tips to make sure you start your new job on the right foot. 
 Understand The Company Culture 
 First, take time to get to know the culture of your new company. The best way to do this is to schedule meetings with your teamâ€”both those who will be working for you and with you.  Ask them questions about their work routine and how they get things accomplished. It's also a good idea to get a sense of how easy or difficult it is to implement new ideas and initiatives. This will give you a good feel for how adaptable (or how slow) the company culture is to change. You should also take note of your own workplace personality and how it fits into the company culture. If you're in need of a good personality test, try Work It Daily's FREE  Workplace Personas Quiz. 
 Identify The Key Stakeholders 
 Next, find out who the key stakeholders are for your specific role and meet with them. For example, if you are entering a company as a finance manager, find out who the key business leaders are that you will be supporting in your position.  Take time to build relationships with them and understand their primary financial concerns. You should also take time to get to know their work routines, and the best times and ways to communicate with them. While communication is important, it's also important to respect each others' schedules. 
 Find A Work Buddy 
 via GIPHY Another tip to help you get off on the right foot at the new job is to get a buddy. This should be a  peer who works  on the same team as you or in the same department as you. This person will help you figure out who's who and give you some inside information on some of those office politics . It's important to understand the team dynamic so you don't step on anyone's toes or disrupt the culture when you first get there. Your buddy is also there for you to ask questions such as, "How do I order office supplies?" or, "How do I set up my voice mailbox?" 
 Show Your Commitment To The Job 
 Next, have a career  conversation with your boss .  This lets him or her know you're serious about and committed to growing your career.  When you first start working at your new company, you may not know enough (yet) to speak specifically about the career paths available there. However, take time to have a conversation with your manager about your aspirations.  Share information about your desires to advance and grow as well as specific information about your strengths and the areas you'd like to develop. Ask your manager for input on your career plan and then use it as a living, active document. 
 Make A 30-60-90 Day Plan 
 Finally, it always helps to have a  30-60-90 day plan  as you start a new job. Document the details of what you want to accomplish in your first three months. (For example, the specific people you want to meet with, the tasks you want to accomplish, etc.) It also helps to share this plan with your manager so you can get some input.  There may be some things missing that your manager views as being critical to accomplish in the first 90 days.  Remember to be flexible with your plan as things may change and objectives you set for the first three months may shift as you get more involved and begin to learn more about your new job.  You want to be seen as committed to meeting the objectives you set, yet flexible enough to deal with changes. By implementing these few simple items, you can get off to a great start at your new job and quickly begin to be viewed as a value-added asset at your new company. Looking for more great advice?
