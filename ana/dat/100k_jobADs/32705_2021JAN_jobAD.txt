 Taking on new music projects: 'Exciting few months ahead and launch of Rishi Arts website'. 
 After a refreshing trip to see the tabla family in California for our annual classes with our Guru Ustad Zakir Hussain, I am extremely happy to be back in England with a range of ‘work’ to look forward to. I have some fantastic projects coming up. Each one is going to be offering something new to my artistic portfolio. 
 Here is a breakdown of them: 
 
 Music Pathways- mentoring young musicians and preparing them for the sector. Arts Council and Youth Music initiative.  http://www.phizzical.com/music-pathways-have-you-got-what-it-takes-to-become-a-leader/ 
 Methods of Misunderstanding- Collaboration with visual artists Ashok Mistry. Looking at tabla notation as data and the way it is interpreted. Supported by Arts Council 
 Antara- My YoTabla students and ADAA students showcase. First live music and dance showcase with young people.  https://uk.patronbase.com/_EmbraceArts/Productions/W523/Performances 
 Freshly Brewed- sharing Assamese music and culture with support from the Arts Council. Composing the music with my sister Dr Samyami S Chowdhury  https://uk.patronbase.com/_EmbraceArts/Productions/W537/Performances 
 
 It is wonderful that each project is different and requires a range of skill sets such as organisation, multitasking and communication. For the projects I am personally leading and producing, strong leadership will be required. For example, the Freshly Brewed project will be showcasing Assamese music and providing a flavour of its culture. North Eastern music is under represented in the UK, so it is very important that I look at the bigger picture to ensure that the Freshly Brewed performances are presented at the highest quality so a lasting positive impression is left on the audience. More importantly, I will need to strategise on where we can take it next. 
 These projects along with my work with Crystal Law, CEMENT, on going YoTabla teaching and other performances, is going to throw up many challenges and heavily test my skills. I can’t wait! This is the only way growth can occur. I would not have it any other way. Being reflective and keeping the big picture clear in each project will enable me to overcome any obstacles. 
 This goes hand in hand with the launch of the Rishi Arts website  www.rishiarts.com  This has been on my to do list for a while and I am really happy it has come to fruition now. I am pleased with the overall content on the site. I have been accumulating content since 2011 and finally seeing the end result has made me grateful for all those opportunities that came to me. The journey of pursuing artistic excellence and serving others never stops. By constantly expressing and sharing this journey, I am hoping other start up creatives will draw inspiration from my experiences. This has only been possible as I have consciously chosen to be around positive, influential, successful and role model type individuals.

 Leadership- does not have to be shouted from the roof tops. 
 
 Since I have immersed myself into the creative sector over the past few years, there is a lot I have learnt about leadership. I draw upon examples from the network of individuals I spend time with. There are particular traits they possess which makes them stand out as leaders. Leadership is a term that can be heavily loaded as there are many definitions and interpretations of it. 
 One of the main aspects I have noticed is that strong leaders do not have to be extroverted and have an outgoing personality. They quietly get on with the task in hand and let their actions speak for them. Robin Sharma sums it up very well ‘Leading without a title’. I strongly believe that everyone is a leader, but the ones who stand out are the ones who are constantly putting ideas into action and delivering on them. They do not say ‘I am an amazing leader’ or ‘I was the best leader on the project’. 
 Leadership runs through many facets of our personal and business lives. It is something that can be learned and everyone has the potential to achieve it. Firstly, one needs a clear vision, definitive purpose in life and desire to carry it out. Based on these elements, leadership qualities will emerge organically. This is because, once you know what you want, you will not settle for anything less. You will always look for the best individuals to be around and utilise their skill set in a mutually beneficial relationship. Tip: Find individuals in your circle who are successful leaders and observe everything about them. 
 There are many projects I am grateful to be involved in this year. Each of them requires me to ‘lead’ in some form. However, it will be highly off putting to fellow collaborators if in meetings I say ‘Hi I’m Rishii, the leader of this project’. Just reading it out loud sounds ridiculous. When you are working hard, taking responsibility and seeing the big picture in any project, the respect that is attached to leadership will be visible. 
 I will end on a wonderful quote by William Shakespeare in Twelfth Night: 
 “Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them”. 
 Feel free to provide your own Interpretation!
