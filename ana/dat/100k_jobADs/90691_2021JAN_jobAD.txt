 Are you a passionate Sales Engineer, with a proven track record winning new business, who'd like to be the "game changer" in changing the direction of this small business? 
 I'm currently recruiting for a privately-owned, precision manufacturing business with a rich history and an exciting future, based in Solihull in Birmingham. With a globally-renowned brand and a market-leading range of products, this family-owned business is looking to grow their small, turnkey fabrication shop into a standalone business supplying the materials handling industry. 
 The business has established relationships with a number of customers, and consistently generates sales opportunities with new potentials, but lacks an experience Sales Engineer to develop technical solutions and follow up robustly to secure orders - this is where you come in. 
 You will have experience working as a Sales Engineer or similar within any technical discipline - capital equipment, process automation, machine tools, material handling amongst others. At the heart of your role, you are a solutions provider who listens to your customer and presents practical, viable solutions to their problems. You're curious and tenacious, and you work in an organised manner to ensure all enquiries are handled professionally and rigorously. 
 The successful candidate will receive a salary of approximately £40,000 plus an uncapped commission structure designed to reward you with your success. Please apply with your CV, or for additional information or a confidential discussion, please call Paul Strachan on 07725-844784. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
