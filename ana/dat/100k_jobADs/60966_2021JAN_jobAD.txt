 (not satire - it's Richard Littlejohn!) 
 Daily Mail columnist Richard Littlejohn must be getting old because he seems to be getting ever so muddled up about things these days. 
 Obviously we all know Littlejohn is a disgusting gutter-press bully-boy for writing articles like the one which bullied the recently deceased primary school teacher Lucy Meadows: 
 Why we need press regulation – primary school teacher bullied by Daily Mail columnist is found dead 
 But being controversial - no matter how many lives it might destroy - is just more readers and on-line hits to the Mail and what it sees as its 'straight-talking' right-wing columnists like Littlejohn. 
 Mind you - I'd have thought the one quality necessary for a 'straight-talking' columnist would be to be …. well ….. straight talking. 
 So how come on 10 December last year, Littlejohn  wrote an article laying into two Australian DJs  for publicly baiting a nurse - Jacintha Saldanha (RIP) - with tragic results, but then just 10 days later  wrote an article himself publicly baiting a teacher  - Lucy Meadows (RIP) - with equally tragic results. 
 I wouldn't have thought there was much 'straight-talking' about being so paradoxically hypocritical you end up disappearing up your own arse with the force of your own inconsistencies, would you? 
 Clearly muddleheaded Littlejohn is in the wrong job. Why not help the Daily Mail save the million a year it pays him by signing this petition asking them to relieve him of the job he clearly can't cope with doing any more: 
 The Daily Mail: Fire Richard Littlejohn for victimizing Lucy Meadows, leading to her possible suicide

 Richard Littlejohn has never been overly concerned with facts; even to the extent that his own Editor (Paul Dacre) when giving evidence to the joint parliamentary committee on the Draft Defamation Bill on 18 July last year stated: 
 thinking about some of the things that Mr Littlejohn writes in my paper, I do not know whether they are honest but they certainly get people talking.

 It is ironic – given his often pejorative language towards disabled people (and the disenfranchised in general) – that Littlejohn then attacks the recent Guardian report on the increasing levels of abuse being suffered by disabled people. Littlejohn writes: 
 Now it is claimed — in The Guardian, naturally — that ‘two-thirds’ of disabled people have been subjected to abuse and threats of violence because of the Government’s plans. 
 Do you believe that? No, me neither. 
 and yet there it was in the levenson enquiry..clear as anything..with the inclusion london and stratchcyde report on the portrayal of disability in the media..

 @Tom i wonderd what would happen if you placed two related items from the same newspaper together what you would get? 
 how about this: 
 first in this case you have Interserve (who ran the disgraceful work program) who have bought up advantage an elderly care at home business who we are told: 
 “Advantage, which manages the care of 500 people, is part of a home healthcare market judged to be worth around £10bn. Analysts also believe public sector budget cuts should drive opportunities for outsourcing companies in this area.” so OUTSOURCING’ of elderly care is profitable !!! 
 This article I found in the telegraph.. 
 http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/supportservices/9753868/Interserve-buys-Advantage-Healthcare-for-26.5m.html 
 then also in telegraph we read this: 
 Snap inspections expose scandal of ‘institutionalised abuse’ in care homes and hospitals 
A landmark programme of unannounced inspections in hospitals and care homes has found that more than a third are still failing to respect elderly people’s basic dignity, despite a series of scandals. 
 http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/elderhealth/9938660/Snap-inspections-expose-scandal-of-institutionalised-abuse-in-care-homes-and-hospitals.html 
 so, elderly care homes nasty very bad (some probbly are) 
but care at home business (very profitable) is better, well it must be cos its a growing market aint it??

 shock horror!!!! Tories visit a foodbank (run by Tories) 
 "Stephen Doughty (Cardiff South and Penarth) (Lab/Co-op): Despite a 400% increase in the demand for food banks since 2010, the Prime Minister has neglected to give clear answers to me or to my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Sarah Champion) about whether he will visit one. May we have a debate on the subject of food banks in this Chamber so that we can bring the facts to the Prime Minister, if he is unwilling to go and see them for himself? 
 Mr Lansley: I heard the Prime Minister’s reply during Prime Minister’s questions yesterday, and the hon. Gentleman might recall that during business questions 
17 Jan 2013 : Column 1044 
 last week I made it clear that my hon. Friend the Member for Loughborough (Nicky Morgan) and I have visited a food bank. We rightly appreciate the service that is being provided by food banks and the Department for Work and Pensions operates a food bank referral service that works with them, including, in particular, the Trussell Trust. The Government are also working independently, not least through the Healthy Start scheme, which helps about 500,000 very low-income families across the UK to buy milk, fruit and vegetables as part of a healthy balanced diet." 
 http://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/mel-kelly/well-trousered-philanthropists-tory-party-chums-and-food-parcels-for-poor 
 "The Trussell Trust describes itself as “a Christian charity that does not affiliate itself with any political party”. It is controlled by Tory Party Councillor and Mayor of Worthing, Neil Atkins and director Chris Mould, who splits his time between the Trussell Trust and the Shaftesbury Partnership." 
 "Co-founder of the Shaftesbury Partnership was Nat Wei, a former McKinsey consultant experienced in both venture philanthropy and venture capital who was appointed the Government’s Chief Adviser on Big Society in May 2010 and made a life peer. He stepped down from the Shaftesbury Partnership and became an Honorary Founding Partner. (On 24 May 2011, Lord Wei stepped down from his Big Society role). 
 Other people in the Shaftesbury Partnership with links to the Tory Party include “Associate” Dominic Llewellyn (Conservative party candidate in 2010 election) who co-authored for the Tories what has now become the government’s Big Society policies. Dominic is an associate in the Big Society Network – which was also co-founded by Cameron’s big society tzar Nat Wei."

 There is a Youtube clip where, on a Richard Littlejohn talkshow of 8th July 1994, a guest, the late Michael Winner, tells Littlejohn that he is "an arsehole" in being dismissive to 2 lesbian girls who are also guests on the show….. 
There is also Johann Hari's blog of June 12, 2005, entitled: "Richard Littlejohn : Racist and Homophobe" in which Hari lists instances where Littlejohn's outspoken opinions have been called into question:
