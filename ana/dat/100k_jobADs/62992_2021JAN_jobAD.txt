  10 Careers That Make You Fat and How to Deal  
 Ariella Coombs 
 June 26, 2012 
 Is  work  making you fat? It could definitely be a factor.  A recent survey  conducted by CareerBuilder found that 44 percent of the workers surveyed gained weight at their current job. The study also highlighted ten occupations that are at the most risk of workers gaining weight. These professions include travel agents, attorneys/judges, social workers, teachers, artists/designers/architects, administrative assistants, physicians, police, firefighters, marketing/PR professionals, and IT professionals. Over 50 percent of workers surveyed blamed their weight gain on sitting at a desk all day. However, stress-eating and eating out on a regular basis were also major factors. Fighting fatigue at the end of a long work day can be challenging, and motivation can be difficult to find. ****The survey found that 10 percent of workers didn't exercise at all, and less than 60 percent worked out on a regular basis. Is this out of laziness? It might be, however, we all know how draining it can be to stare at a computer screen all day. Who has energy or motivation  to go for a run or prepare a healthy meal after doing that all day? 
 What do you do to stay healthy at work? 
 So, how do you deal with this problem? Here are three tips to stay healthy and fit at work:  Take a walk on your lunch break.  Taking a 15-20 minute walk at lunch is an easy way to get a little exercise in at work. Not to mention, it will help you energize your brain so you can  be more productive !  Exercise in your chair.  Who would have thought that, while you're writing your reports or going through e-mails, you could be exercising, too! Check out some  easy office chair exercises  from Web MD.  Pack healthy snacks.  Replace your chips with a healthier version of munchies. Crunch on some baby carrots or fresh bell pepper strips instead (you can even dip them in ranch dressing, yum!).
