 Hello Khusboo, 
Thanks for dropping me a line, apologies for my late reply!! 
Best to check out  http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/migrant_workers/employment_permits/work_permits.html 
It gives you a good overview on how it all works with workpermits. 
Let me know if you have any further questions!
