 Ethyca builds automated data privacy infrastructure and tools for developers and privacy teams to easily build products that comply with GDPR, CCPA Privacy Regulations. Ethyca's powerful and flexible automated data privacy and protection tools provide any business with a future-proof solution to compliance with privacy regulations across global jurisdictions. Whether you're simply collecting consumer email addresses or inferring complex data points from unlimited data points, Ethyca provides your product, engineering and privacy teams with unmatched ease of use and functionality to better care about your user's data. We believe that user privacy matters more now than ever and that the solution to managing user data is not in regulation but in code. We are a passionate and excited team of problem-solvers (that also happen to be music lovers, exercise enthusiasts, PC and console gamers, and wine aficionados). We not only love solving challenges for our customers, but also thinking about the current and future state of data privacy in society. At its core, Ethyca is engineering company. We're building a missing component of the internet's infrastructure - privacy-respecting data systems. If you're as stimulated about this mission as we are, we'd love to talk to you.
