 Joberg2C 
 April 2015 
 We are very grateful to the N3TC for the continued support of Music Voyage and therefore it was our pleasure to play in the N3TC Chill Zone at the Clifton village leg of the Joberg2C. The most colourful T-shirts, banners and business cards given to us by N3TC made all the difference! Our students love wearing the t-shirts, they feel important and special and look so smart. Together with the banner and the music we make such an impact and are very proud musicians.
