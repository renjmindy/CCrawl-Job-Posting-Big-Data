 Parked on the dole: Closing Job Centres and handing responsibility for finding work to private companies would condemn thousands - if not hundreds of thousands - of people to a life on benefits (if they don't get sanctioned and starve). 
 It 's incredible that allies of George Osborne are backing proposals to shut down all Job Centres and let private companies fill the void. 
 The proposal to let the private sector find work for Britain's unemployed is actually being considered for inclusion in the Conservative Party's election manifesto for 2015,  according to the  Huffington Post . 
 It quotes a 'senior Tory' who told  The Sun  : "Introducing competition into the job search market is a natural Conservative thing to do." 
 This means Conservatives are naturally unimaginative, if not altogether stupid. 
 Have they already forgotten the lessons learnt from the way work programme provider companies treated jobseekers that were sent their way -  as  Vox Political  reported last year ? 
 The process is known as "creaming and parking". 
 Work programme providers knew that - because they get paid on the basis of the results they achieve - they needed to concentrate on the jobseekers who were more likely to find work quickly. These people were "creamed" off and fast-tracked into work, thereby creating profit for the companies. 
 And the others? Those who need more time and investment? They were "parked" - left without help, to languish in the benefit system for months and years on end - in a situation that Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has said many times that he wanted to reverse. 
 In fact, his policies have perpetuated the problem. 
 And now George Osborne wants to spread this practice to all jobseekers, across the country. 
 It 's time the voting public woke up to what the Conservative Party is, and "parked" it in the history books where it belongs.

 Government's 'troubled families' programme is failing; we knew it would

 Remember back in April last year, when  Vox Political  said the Coalition government's plan to stop children in 'troubled' families from playing truant, while finding work for the adults and stopping both from committing crime, was doomed to failure? 
 If you don't, it's not surprising (our readership back then was around a quarter of its current level) - and you haven't missed much, because the scheme is back in the news as it is (again, unsurprisingly) failing. 
 The  VP  article  pointed out that the government had been fiddling the figures in its bid to make it seem that 120,000 such families exist in the UK; in fact, "the number came from Labour research on disadvantaged families with multiple and complex needs, rather than families that caused problems," according to 'trouble families tsar' Louise Casey at the time. 
 The article pointed out that local councils, offered a £4,000 bonus for each 'troubled' family they identified and helped (for want of a better word) were shoehorning families into the scheme - whether they qualified or not - just to make up the numbers. 
 It was doomed from the start. 
 So today we have figures obtained by Labour's Hilary Benn, showing that around 106,500 families have been identified for the scheme (according to averages worked out from councils that responded to a Freedom of Information request). Of these, only around 35,500 were engaged by the scheme, which then failed in three-quarters of cases (around 26,600 families). 
 That leaves 8,878 families who actually came back to the straight-and-narrow - less than one-thirteenth of the target figure. 
 A success rate this low could have been achieved if the government had done nothing. 
 (That seems to be a running theme with the Coalition. What else does it remind us of? Ah, yes…  The Work Programme . In this context it is extremely interesting that Mr Benn said the biggest obstruction to the scheme was the Work Programme's failure "to deliver jobs to the poorest people in society".) 
 According to  The Guardian , "Data from 133 councils out of the 152 participating in the scheme found that almost one in seven families that had been "turned around" were either still on drugs, had children missing from school or involved in criminal acts. 
 "Another 60 per cent of households deemed to have been successfully helped by the scheme in March still had adults on unemployment benefits after leaving the programme." 
 Bearing in mind the £4,000 'carrot' that was waved in front of councils as encouragement for them to take part, you'll enjoy the revelation that each local authority claimed to have found an average of 812 troubled families - 20 per cent more than central government had estimated. 
 Again, this is hardly surprising. Government-imposed council tax freezes have starved local authorities of money and £4,000, multiplied by 812, brings an average of £3,250,000 into each local authority that they would not, otherwise, have had. 
 So much for David Cameron 's plan to "heal the scars of the broken society". 
 The Guardian  also tells us that the 'troubled families' programme was launched by Cameron as a Big Society (remember that?) response to the riots of summer 2011. 
 In fact it doesn't matter what the Coalition government does - or, indeed, what Labour plans to do if that party comes into office in 2015; schemes that are imposed on people from above will never succeed. 
 The problem is that  the United Kingdom has become an increasingly unequal society  , with money and privilege bled out of the majority of the population (who do most of the work for it) and into the hands of a very small number who have power and - it seems - no responsibility at all. 
 The vast majority of us are seen as disposable commodities by these exploiters - whose number includes a large proportion of MPs with interests in private business; they use us to make their huge profits and then throw us into unemployment. 
 Is it any wonder that such betrayal breeds families that turn away from the system and take to crime instead? 
 When David Cameron slithered into Downing Street he said he wanted to "re-balance" society. In fact, he  over  -balanced it even more in favour of privilege and wealth. 
 Now we need a  proper  re-balancing of society. The only way to solve the problem of 'troubled families' - a problem said to cost us £9 billion every year, by the way - is for people to be born into a society where everybody is valued and receives a fair (in the dictionary sense of the term, rather than the Conservative Party definition) reward for their contribution. 
 That will mean a fundamental shift in attitudes that should be taught to everybody from the cradle upwards. 
 You won't get it under the Conservatives or any other right-wing government because they are exploiters by definition. 
 Will you get it under Labour? 
 Possibly. But a lot of right-wing Blairite dead wood will have to be cleared out first, and Hilary Benn is not the man his father was.

 At last the crisis of British democracy is addressed by a party leader: ED MILIBAND

 Champion of democracy: Ed Miliband told the country he wants Parliament to provide what the people want, signalling that Labour plans to return to the principles of democratic government that have been abandoned by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. 
 Hopefully the naysayers among  Vox Political  's readership will have a little more respect for Mr Miliband after today. 
 He is the first - and so far, the  only -  leader of a mainstream British political party to have correctly identified the biggest problem facing our democracy at this time: 
 The fact that people aren 't bothering to vote. 
 Here's what he said, in his response to the Queen's Speech: 
 "The custom of these debates is to address our opponents across the despatch box in this House, but today on its own that would be inadequate to the challenge we face. 
 "There is an even bigger opponent to address in this Queen’s Speech debate - the belief among many members of the public that this House cannot achieve anything at all.  Any party in it. 
 "About 10 per cent of people entitled to vote, voted for UKIP in the recent elections. But - as significant - over 60 per cent did not vote at all. 
 "And whatever side we sit on, we will all have heard it on the doorstep: _ 'You’re all the same, you’re in it for yourself, it doesn’t matter who I vote for.'_ 
 "Of course, that’s not new, but there is a depth and a scale of disenchantment which we ignore at our peril - disenchantment that goes beyond one party, beyond one government. 
 "  There is no bigger issue for our country and our democracy. 
 "So, the test for this legislative programme, the last before the general election, is to show that it responds - to the scale of the discontent and the need for answers. 
 "In this election, we heard concerns about the way the EU works and the need for reform. We heard deep-rooted concerns about immigration and the need to make changes. But I believe there is an even deeper reason for this discontent. 
 "Fundamentally, too many people in our country feel Britain doesn’t work for them and hasn’t done so for a long time: 
 "In the jobs they do and whether their hard work is rewarded. 
 "In the prospects for their children and whether they will lead a better life than their parents, including whether they will be able to afford a home of their own. 
 "And in the pressures communities face. 
 "Above all,  whether the work and effort people put in is reflected in them sharing fairly in the wealth of this country. 
 "The Governor of the Bank of England gave a remarkable speech last week saying inequality was now one of the biggest challenges in our country.  We should all be judged on how we respond to this question, right as well as left. 
 "There are measures we support in this Queen’s Speech including tackling modern slavery, an Ombudsman for our Armed Forces and recall. 
 "But the big question for this Queen’s Speech is whether it just offers more of the same or whether it offers a new direction, so we can genuinely say it works for all and not just a few at the top." 
 Yes - exactly.  Yes! 
 Within the last couple of days, I was saying on the  Vox Facebook  page that Labour needs to recognise the threat posed by UKIP in the context of disenchantment with democracy: With so few people voting, the door is thrown open to loony extremist right-wing parties. 
 The only solution is for the mainstream parties to ensure they know exactly what the people will support and offer the electorate what we want, rather than what they want to push on us. 
 With this speech, Mr Miliband has made it clear that he gets it, and that he is listening. 
 As the only leader who does - and is - this should put him well ahead by next May. 
 All he has to do is deliver what he has promised.

 UKIP backlash gains momentum with Farage radio interview

 Friends in right-wing places: Nigel Farage with (among others) US right-wingers Ron Paul and James Beeland Rogers Jr. [Image swiped from Pride's Purge.] 
 LBC radio interviewer James O 'Brien's encounter with Nigel Farage has been gaining attention and approval up and down the UK, after it became clear that the charismatic UKIP leader wasn't just defeated on many issues - he was routed. 
 Considering Farage's own win against Nick Clegg in the televised debates earlier this year, it seems we've come to a lamentable situation in this country, where politicians can lose a battle of wits with anyone who has taken the time to do a little research. 
 That being said, if anyone were to ask who  you  would prefer to have running the country, it's unlikely that either profession would figure in the top two. 
 The interviewer confirmed the findings of many social media bloggers over the past few days, starting with reference to two more UKIP members who had shown their true homophobic and hypocritical colours. 
 He quoted former UKIP council candidate John Lyndon Sullivan, who tweeted: "I rather often wonder, if we shot one poofter, whether the next 99 would decide on balance that they weren't after all. We might then conclude that it's not a matter of genetics but rather more a matter of education." 
 And UKIP's small business spokesman has employed seven illegal immigrants in the last year, said Mr O'Brien. 
 Farage employed the usual UKIP tactic, which is to demand that the questioner find out "what's going on in the other parties". O'Brien put him straight by pointing out that the other parties weren't the issue at hand. 
 Later in the interview, he added: "The reason it doesn't possess the same urgency as the UKIP conversation does is - (a) - the question of quantity; there is simply not the avalanche of bigotry emerging from other parties that emerges from yours, and - (b) - … the opinion polls do not report significant swathes of the country who are fearful that your party represents deeply divisive and racist ideas." 
 He was saying it is possible that UKIP is influencing people into adopting those anti-immigrant and racist ideas themselves - and this theory has been borne out by some of the pro-UKIP comments on the  Vox Political Facebook  page (but you have to catch them quickly, before the perpetrators realise they've erred and remove them). 
 Regarding JL Sullivan, Farage said he wasn't a councillor but a council candidate, then contradicted himself by saying he had not heard of that gentleman's name. If that were true, how would Farage know whether he was a councillor or a candidate? 
 Farage's assertion that he would face a disciplinary charge on whether he had brought the party into disrepute was punctured by the revelation that his tweet was made in February. 
 On the illegal immigrants, Farage's defence was holed by the revelation that his small business spokesman resigned as a company director three days  after  the immigration raid. 
 A conversation about Farage's discomfort, sitting in a train carriage in which nobody else spoke English, was surreal. When I was a student I had the unique pleasure of sharing a carriage with a crowd of French schoolchildren. That was uncomfortable too, but I didn't attach any unreasonable baggage to it - it wasn't an indication that French kids were overrunning Britain and it didn't show that the French were all loud and overexcitable. It was one train carriage and Farage should have more of a sense of proportion. 
 O'Brien put his finger on the nerve and pressed hard: "The point you're making is that schools in the East End are filled with children who cannot speak English. .. That's not true… Children who are typified as speaking English as a second language would include your own daughters… Perhaps [if we checked] we would realise that most bilingual children in this country are children like yours?" 
 He continued, highlighting accusations of bigotry and hypocrisy: "What the caller asked you was why so many people think you're racist… and… you talk about children who can't speak English as a first language without mentioning it includes your own children." 
 There was an implication that Farage, who has banned former members of the BNP from joining UKIP in an effort to protect the party from adverse publicity, has himself associated with the far-right organisation; and a question over the far-right parties with which UKIP sits in the European Parliament. Farage said UKIP would not sit with people who didn't have a reasonable point of view but O'Brien flagged up a member of the group who had said the ideas of Anders Breivik, the Norwegian mass murderer, Islamophobe, Anti-Semite and anti-feminist, were "in defence of Western civilisation". 
 Farage's paper-thin defence was that the European political discourse was very different to the UK, (again) an admission that his party had encountered problems with "one or two members", and a reference to problems in other parties (the Conservatives, on this occasion) 
 O'Brien leapt on this: "Your defence so far is that you're no different from any other political party and yet your unique selling point … is that you  are  different." In addition, he pointed out that Farage refers to "members of the political class and their friends in the media", while writing columns for the  Independent  and  Express  newspapers every week and appearing on the BBC's  Question Time  more often than anyone apart from David Dimbleby. 
 Farage should count himself lucky he was not also asked about  his connections with American right-wingers , including Ron Paul (Godfather of the Tea Party) and James Beeland Rogers Jr who, together with George Soros, engineered the British economic crash of 1992. 
 Farage tried to defend his way of equating Romanians with criminality by saying that Roma people in other countries have been forced into a situation where crime is their only option - and then was forced into a corner when O'Brien mentioned UKIP's fearmongering poster, that claims millions of potential immigrants are after the jobs of British people. Wasn't he demonising foreigners by saying they will take all the jobs and push crime up? 
 "I'm not demonising anyone," said Farage, then contradicted himself: "I'm demonising a political class that has allowed us to have an open door that allowed things like this to happen." 
 "So when I say Romanian and you start talking about people traffickers, why don't you say people are perfectly entitled to feel uncomfortable about living next door to people traffickers, wherever they're from?" asked Mr O'Brien. "Why do you say 'Romanians'?" 
 Get ready for another contradiction: "I didn't say Romanians; I was asked… if a group of Romanian men moved in next door to you, would you be concerned, and if you lived in London I think you would be." 
 It was while Farage was being questioned on his expenses that Patrick O'Flynn, UKIP's director of communications and former  Daily Express  political commentator, stepped in (claiming that O'Brien was over-running, 19 minutes into a 20-minute interview). Mr O'Brien's response: "Is this a friend in the media or a member of the political class?" 
 Homophobia, racism, hypocrisy, and an incitement for others to display the same characteristics. 
 Does this country really need that kind of alternative to mainstream politics?

 Who will 'Help to Work' really help?

 The government 's latest draconian measure - to drive people who have been living off the state for more than three years into all the nonexistent jobs that ministers insist are waiting for them - was launched today. (Monday) 
 Help to Work forces jobseekers to sign on every day, commit to six months of voluntary work, or sign up to a training scheme (the last two effectively removing them from the government's unemployment figures without getting them a job) - or face having their Jobseeker's Allowance docked for increasing lengths of time. 
 It 's clearly a scam to fiddle the joblessness statistics  but, dear reader, you're intelligent enough to have worked it out before you even started reading this. 
 Of course, voluntary work must be offered without coercion - otherwise it's slavery - and for this reason leading charities have already announced that they will boycott the mandatory work placement part of the scheme. 
 Particularly disturbing - and we should be grateful that they highlighted this - is the fact that this aspect would lead to jobseekers doing more than double the 300-hours'-maximum community work than convicted criminals, who are ordered to carry out certain tasks as punishment for their offences. 
 The Guardian   used the government's own data to prove that Help to Work does not increase anybody's chances of getting a job, and is more likely to put people off signing on for the benefits to which they are entitled - a 'punishment' effect that the government is desperate to play down. 
 Esther McVey, speaking on Radio 4's  Today  programme in support of the scheme, said instead that it would be particularly useful for "people who have been away from the marketplace and the workplace for long periods of time", and specifically mentioned those suffering from mental illness. 
 All right then, let's ask this: 
 How well would this scheme fare in trying to find a job for a man aged 60 with no academic qualifications worth mentioning (left school at 14 and has lied about further education achievements), whose working life consists of a failed Army career that lasted less than six years, followed by irregular stints selling arms, working in a property company and selling gun-related magazines, in between periods on the dole. He has been funded by the taxpayer continuously since 1992 - a total of 22 years 'parked' at our expense. There are concerns about his state of mind, with fears that he suffers from paranoia and delusions. 
 Could Help to Work  really  find a job for a man like this? 
 Let 's hope so - because, if there's any justice, Iain Duncan Smith will be looking for a job after next year's general election.

 Does UKIP's Euro election poll lead really reflect the people's view?

 Deception? - The controversial UKIP advert using an Irish actor, who plays a British worker replaced by cheap Labour from Europe. 
 YouGov research for the  Sunday Times  has put UKIP in the lead in the European election contest, with support from 31 per cent of those who were surveyed. 
 This put the Eurosceptic party three points ahead of Labour (28 per cent) and a massive 12 points ahead of the Conservatives (just 19 per cent). 
 But does this really mean the Party with its Foot in its Mouth has the people's confidence? Take a look at these comments from the  Vox Political  Facebook page and form your own conclusions. I hasten to add that this is an unscientific survey, composed of comments from those who had the most to say. 
 We'll start with those who support the party. 
 Most vocal is Denise Cottham. She writes: "Mr Farage has the guts to actually 'SAY' what many other people just 'THINK!' We respect him for this. He speaks the TRUTH & is not out to deceive the public like the major parties have done all these years, while growing fatter & richer at the country's expense! And exactly where does the Green party stand regarding the EU? They make appealing promises, but will be unable to keep them without ASKING permission from the EU!!! UKIP priorities make sense, staying in the EU does not." 
 Denise Morris adds: "I'll be voting UKIP and so will many, many other concerned with EU policies that mean we can't kick out radical hate preachers, without it costing the taxpayer millions and not only that we'll pay their benefits, get them a nice big house and all while our human rights lawyers try to prevent their deportation, thanks to the EU. It's no wonder people are looking for other alternatives. Currently our only serious hope is UKIP. We all know where the Cons, Lab and Libs stand, so voting for either of these parties won't solve anything. 
 "They are the only party that can take on the other major parties and are gaining popularity. People are fed up with broken promises, lies, the open door policy. I don't like all of UKIP's policies, but I don't like all the Cons' or Lab either. Labour betrayed the working classes and the Cons have tackled the economy, but at a cost to who? The poor, the vulnerable, so I am totally with you on that one. I have to vote for what I think is best for the future of this country and my children and grandchildren and as I see it, that's UKIP at the moment. If Labour gave us a referendum and promised to save the NHS, restrict immigration, tackled the economy, then I would seriously consider voting labour but that isn't going to happen sadly. It's like being between a rock and a hard place and we need a serious shake up of politics in this country. Something has to change and for the better and maybe the challenge from UKIP will do just that." 
 She seems to have confused the European Union with the European Court of Human Rights… "The fact is the British people were conned big time on the EU. We thought we were entering a common market and now most of our laws are made in Europe. Their judges take precedence over our own judges. We were never given the referendum we should have got and UKIP are the only party guaranteeing one. If that happens then MPs can start voting with their conscience again, instead of voting for party policies." 
 Regarding the controversial poster in which a foreign actor (from Ireland) was used to represent a British worker whose job had been taken away by evil immigrants, Craig Burnside writes: "UKIP arent against immigration, they just want to control it like countries like Australia and the USA do and outsource jobs." 
 On the other side we have the following messages. 
 From Neil Wilson: "I honestly thought nobody could run a worse PR campaign than Bitter Together in Scotland re: the Independence Referendum, But I have to say UKIP are managing to do so in only a week. My particular favourite is the fact you can send their leaflets back to the Freepost address and they get charged for each one. So, they come to your border (door/letterbox) and you send them packing and make them pay for it. After all it's what they would have wanted don't you think? very apt. Although the Boarders typo is running a close second. I would vote for somebody to protect me from boarders, particularily old Etonians. But … best just to keep quiet and enjoy watching them make a monumental cock-up of a campaign all by themselves." 
 From Kim Burns: "It's the irony that's amusing us. Of course we're not going to vote UKIP! They don't like women going out to work, they want to reduce maternity leave to 4 weeks, they want to reduce taxes for the rich and increase them for the poor! Read their manifesto, people!" 
 We would if we could find it! How about this, from John Elwyn Kimber: "Those who wish to register a Eurosceptic vote without empowering the odious UKIP might be lucky enough to have a candidate representing the late Bob Crow's 'No to EU, Yes to Democracy' campaign - as in the Eastern counties. Or vote Green." 
 From Bette Rogerson: "Why would you vote for a party that says it hates Europe, but at the same time takes lots and lots of money from the European parliament? Why vote for a party whose members advocate policies like less tax for the wealthiest, cutting of maternity leave and forcible sterilisation of the disabled? Why vote for a party who wants to take the vote away from the unemployed? Is your job really that secure? Lastly but not least, why vote for a party which claims it wants British jobs for the British and then hires an Irish actor to model as a poor Briton whose job has been taken away by a foreigner?" 
 Of course, I have also weighed into these discussions. Here's my response to Denise C: "The facts are against you. Why is Farage now trying to block an inquiry into his MEP expenses? What does he have to hide? Why, if he's so keen on preventing foreigners from taking British jobs, did his party hire an Irish actor to pretend to be a British worker in a poster? Why did he hire a German to be his PA (and, come to that, what about the nepotism inherent in the fact that this person is his wife)? Why did the UKIP poster showing an 'ordinary' British woman who was going to vote UKIP actually show a party member responsible for public relations? Put all these things together and it seems UKIP and the truth are a  huge  distance apart. 
 "Look at UKIP members and the appalling things they have been saying. Farage moves to shut them up and kick them out whenever they do, but a point has to be reached soon when he - and the rest of us - realises that this is the natural mindset of his party and, as such, it is unelectable." 
 To Denise Morris's comments about European judges, I pointed out: "The European Court is different from the European Union, Denise. If Britain withdrew from the EU, it would still be a part of the court. Also, UKIP is very clearly not the only party guaranteeing [a referendum] - it's not even the only right-wing, reactionary and repressive party offering such a guarantee." 
 I added: "The Cons have  not  tackled the economy. If you believe that, you're not paying attention. I'm glad you agree that the poor and vulnerable have suffered in any case. Labour has promised to save the NHS and tackle the economy (in a more meaningful way than the Tories). Labour's attitude to a referendum may seem less than wholehearted but my impression is that they think it would get a knee-jerk reaction that would show what people do  not  understand about our participation in the European Union, rather than what they do - your mistake about the European Court is an indication that they might have a point. 
 "Regarding immigration, my personal belief is that the EU - including the UK - made a big mistake in allowing free movement between countries including new member states whose economies were not yet up to par with the better-established industrial nation states. All they have done is de-stabilise both the states from which people are emigrating and those into which they immigrate… so I would like a tighter policy on this, not just here but in the Union as a whole. 
 "And those who complain that we voted ourselves into an economic community, not a political union, are correct too. All of these things can be remedied from inside the EU, and if we were to withdraw rather than try to tackle them as a member state, the result would be worse for all of Europe in the long run. UKIP does not see that and the Conservatives cannot see past their own greed and corruption - look at who funds them (bankers and private health firms) and you'll see that this is the case. The Tory Democrats have sold their souls but Labour is just beginning to find its own soul again. That's why I think Labour is the best hope for Britain next year." 
 Responding to former Labour voter Brian Taylor, who said he wasn't enthused with UKIP but they would get his vote until a viable alternative came along, I wrote: "Do you really want a flat-rate of 31 per cent income tax, that hugely benefits the extremely rich and enormously harms the poor? That's UKIP policy. 
 "If not, you probably want the Green Party, which would also hold a referendum on Europe but is far less Tory in its outlook. I can't imagine a former Labour voter would honestly want to vote for a party that was further on the right of the political spectrum than the Conservatives." 
 So what 's the conclusion? 
 Well, from this snapshot we can see that, as Denise Cottham and Brian Taylor claimed, people think all three major parties have deceived the public and will do so again. Labour in particular is seen as having betrayed its core constituency - the working classes - in favour of  Daily Mail  readers and bankers who simply won't vote for any party more left-wing than the Conservatives. Worse still, for Labour, is people's belief that the party has been told - time and time again - what it needs to do, but has continually ignored this good advice. UKIP's problem is that its new advertising campaign also deceives the public, and leader Nigel Farage's eagerness to block an inquiry into his MEP expenses suggests further jiggery-pokery. 
 People in general also seem to be genuinely disgruntled with the EU's 'free movement' policy which allows people from any member state to take up residence in any other member state. There is evidence to show that it was a mistake to allow less-developed countries, particularly in Eastern Europe, to take advantage of this policy as many of their citizens have immigrated into the more prosperous regions - leaving their own countries struggling to build their economies, and threatening the stability of the destination countries, whose infrastructure is left struggling to cope with the influx. 
 UKIP supporters are primarily interested in having an in-out referendum on membership of the European Union, but - as Denise Morris demonstrates - do not seem to understand clearly the issues on which they will be voting. Denise's concern about the laws preventing us from deporting foreign-born 'hate preachers' would not be addressed by leaving the European Union as it comes under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights. 
 Their grasp of other UKIP policies seems catastrophically poor, though - policies including restricting work opportunities for women and cutting maternity leave, reducing taxes for the rich and raising them for the poor (to a flat rate of 31 per cent), sterilisation of the disabled (if Bette Rogerson's research is correct), and ending universal suffrage by stopping the unemployed from voting. 
 They also seem to have a weak grasp of other parties' policies regarding the EU - the Green Party wants a referendum but Denise C thinks they don't. 
 My overall impression is that UKIP is still gaining support as a party of protest, rather than because people have any belief in its policies. The person on the street - whatever their belief - feels "utterly powerless… hopeless and increasingly disinterested", a sentiment expressed by Karlie Marvel on the Facebook page today. 
 That's why UKIP is ahead today. 
 It isn 't a good enough reason and the other party leaders can now see what they need to do about it - especially Labour.

 How can a company that has discriminated against the disabled be 'DisabilityConfident'?

 Here 's a mixed message: 
 The Conservative-led Coalition government wants us all to believe that the number of disabled people getting support to get or keep a job is rocketing. 
 But the businessman it is using to front its PR campaign founded a company that has been convicted of discrimination against the disabled in the recent past. 
 According to  the government's press release , Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the founder of Easyjet, said: “Already over 100,000 disabled entrepreneurs employ an equivalent number of people in their business start-ups. 
 "I encourage disabled people out there who have a germ of an idea for a business, but are unsure of how to go about it, to take advantage of the support the government has on offer to help you make your business fly.” 
 But in 2011,  EasyJet told a boy with muscular dystrophy that he could not fly  - because his electric wheelchair was too heavy for baggage handlers. 
 And in 2012,  Paralympics presenter Sophie Morgan received similar treatment . 
 It seems, if you are disabled,  EasyJet 's business has been to keep you on the ground . 
 The government reckons the number of people using its Access to Work scheme has risen by more than 10 per cent, to 31,230 - and has claimed that disabled people are moving into jobs, training or work placements at a rate of more than 100 every working day. 
 But the press release does not elaborate on how many of these jobs are permanent, how many are merely temporary placements, how many are self-employment start-ups that will receive funding for a short period and will fold when the grants run out, and so on. 
 Apparently it is all part of a campaign launched by David Cameron last year, called DisabilityConfident. 
 From what 's on show here, it seems disabled people have precious little reason to be confident.

 Labour will ban MPs from having second jobs - hooray!

 Corporate 'partners': These are just some of the companies that 'work with' your representatives in Parliament. Wouldn't it be better if the relationship was kept at arms-length and your MP wasn't their employee? 
 This is an important step on the way towards winning a personal crusade of  Vox Political  - to clear corruption out of the House of Commons. 
 The Labour Party will change the law to ban MPs from having second jobs including corporate directorships, employment or consultancy work. 
 Think about it; this means MPs will no longer be allowed to have dangerous conflicts of interest between their positions as representatives of the electorate and any responsibilities to other employers. 
 It would go a long way towards meeting the terms of the  Vox Political  e-petition from last year, which called on Parliament to ban MPs from voting on matters in which they have a financial interest. 
 It would  not  help when MPs have shares in particular companies - but those should be declared in the register of members' interests in any case, and neglect to mention such interests should lead to strict penalties. 
 I know. The Maria Miller case (to quote a recent example) isn't going to fill anybody with hope, is it? 
 A  Daily Mail  report  has stated that the move will infuriate many MPs on both sides of the House, and some  Facebook  commenters have already trotted out the now-tired line that they'll believe it when they see it, or Labour won't be able to push the measure through as MPs would oppose it. 
 That's a mistake - a whipped vote in a House of Commons with a Labour majority means an automatic victory - in exactly the same way the Coalition government has continually won controversial votes in the current Parliament (against ardent Labour opposition that has subsequently gone unnoticed by the public - or at least, by many commenters on this site). 
 The  Mail  's article affected shock at Labour's temerity in wanting to force this measure on members of other political parties, claiming it is likely to fuel claims that the party is anti-business. 
 This is, of course, poppycock. How is it anti-business to make sure serving members of Parliament concentrate on their jobs as public representatives, rather than trying to serve two masters at once? It seems more likely that business will revive without their over-rated expertise. 
 After all, look how well they 've managed the nation's finances! 
 The  Mail  also quoted some goon who said it meant the electorate would be lumbered with more career politicians who have worked as researchers and special advisors, when there need to be MPs in every party who have had "real world" professional experience. 
 This too is poppycock. There is no reason a person in any career cannot stand for election and, if returned to Parliament, take a sabbatical from their day job until they are voted out again or choose to return to their vocation. 
 Ah. I've just looked up the name of the goon who made this claim: Tory MP Andrew Bridgen. Need I say more? 
 Finally, the  Mail  turned to the Institute of Directors for support. It's as if the paper really wanted to hammer home how corrupt the system has become, and will remain, if left as it is. Of course, the director general, Simon Walker, said MPs could better serve the public if they have "active links" with the business community. 
 Well, of course! 
 How could he influence Parliamentary decisions without a few directors in the Cabinet? 
 This is a policy that we should all support to the hilt. 
 I strongly advise you to contact your MP and seek their support for it.

 Osborne promising full employment - is this an April Fool?

 Bottom of the class: If you believe George Osborne's talk about jobs and benefits, you must have been educated at one of Michael Gove's 'free schools'. [Image: Gaianeconomics] 
 The answer has to be in the affirmative. Conservatives can 't promise full employment because it simply isn't part of their philosophy. 
 As this blog has stated many times, Tories need a discontented underclass fermenting away beneath the lowest-paid members of the working class, in order to create the level of fear necessary to keep wages down. 
 The argument is that a person will not ask for a pay rise if they know their boss will turn around and say, "There are hundreds out there who will work for less than you - pick up your cards on the way out!" 
 For a more easy-access disproval of Osborne's claim, we only have to look a little further into his speech - from the part where he said:  " For it’s no good creating jobs – if we’re also paying people to stay on welfare." 
 Hang on! When did our great Social Security system change from being a safety net to help get people back into work to  " paying people to stay on welfare" ? 
 Oh yes, that's right - when we had an unelected Conservative government foisted on us. Tories pay people to stay on welfare because they need that fermenting underclass.  The aim is always not to pay enough (as you will see). 
 The next few lines contain unfounded claims and opinions. See for yourself: 
 " We inherited a welfare system that didn’t work."  According to whom? 
 " There was not enough help for those looking for a job – people were just parked on benefits."  But there isn't enough help now. Come to that, there aren't enough jobs.  Where are all the jobs, George? 
 " Frankly, there was not enough pressure to get a job – some people could just sign on and get almost as much money staying at home as going out to work."  How many people, George? Five? Six? You make it seem as though more than a million jobseekers were sitting at home and drawing as much money in social security as at work.  That would be a lie, George. 
 " That’s not fair to them – because they get trapped in poverty and their aspirations are squashed."  Whereas Conservative policy means what? Oh yes - they get trapped in poverty and their aspirations are squashed. 
 " It’s certainly not fair to taxpayers like you, who get up, go out to work, pay your taxes and pay for those benefits."   Tory divide-and-rule.   You  are different to  them  , because  you  have a  job . If you are low-paid, it is because  they  are sucking down your tax money to pay for their extravagant lifestyles (I think we've all quite thoroughly killed that particular myth, haven't we? It doesn't exist outside the Tory political mind). 
 " Next Monday is when we do more to encourage people without jobs to find them… Benefits will only go up by 1 per cent – so they don’t go up faster than most people’s pay rises, as used to be the case."  This means people on benefits will start to become much worse-off than they are already. Jobseekers' allowance used to be pegged at around one-sixth of average pay but will now drop to a far lower proportion, because the Tories lied to you when they said benefit rises were far greater than pay rises. One per cent of Jobseekers' Allowance at a weekly rate of £71 is 70p; one per cent of the average weekly wage in April 2013,  which was £517 per week , is £5.17.  You see the difference?  Oh, and one more thing:  Where are all the jobs, George? 
 " When I took this job, some people were getting huge payouts – receiving £50,000, £60,000 even up to £100,000 in benefits. More than most people could get by working."  How many people, George? Five? Six? One, perhaps? 
 " So we’ve capped benefits, so that a family out of work can’t get more in benefits than the average working family."  I'm not actually opposed to ensuring that people on benefits can't take home more than people in work. However, while accurate, this line is disingenuous. George has ensured that a family out of work takes home at least £5,000  less  , per year, than an average working family because of the way he and his Tory friends rigged the system.  He 's lying to you. 
 " And we are bringing in a new Universal Credit to make sure work always pays."  He means "pays more than benefits". He  doesn 't  mean "pays a living wage".  Spot the difference? 
 Now here comes some more oppression, based on a really  big  lie. 
 " From this month we’re also making big changes to how people go about claiming benefits. We all understand that some people need more help than others to find work."  What work?  Where are all the jobs, George? 
 " So starting this month we’ll make half of all people on unemployment benefits sign on every week – and people who stay on benefits for a long time will have to go to the job centre every day so they can get constant help and encouragement."  Help and encouragement, is it, George? Have you witnessed the kind of "help and encouragement" they get at the job centre? DWP employees should face harassment charges for the disgraceful way they treat their fellow citizens. 
 " We’re going to require people to look for work for a week first before they get their unemployment benefit. From now on the deal is this: look for work first; then claim the dole. Not the other way around."  Why? In order to drive people into grinding poverty as early as possible? Forcing people to wait until they claim means they could be without money for food, accommodation and utilities for up to a month, while the system processes them. This is not fair. It is cruel and demeaning -  especially when Tory George knows there 's no work to be had. 
 " When people turn up at the job centre they’ll be expected to have a CV ready and to have started looking on our new jobs website."  This is the Universal Jobmatch website that is habitually used by criminals for identity theft, or to offer jobs in the sex industry. It's so bad that the government itself is planning to ditch it when the contract with its provider runs out in two years' time.  Why would anybody in their right mind use that? 
 And now here's the clincher: 
 " We will ask many of the long term unemployed to do community work in return for their benefits - whether it is making meals for the elderly, clearing up litter, or working for a local charity." 
 In other words, they will ensure that fewer jobs are available by making jobseekers do the work for nothing.  Brilliant idea, George - you are wrecking our economy. 
 " All of this is bringing back the principles that our welfare state was originally based on – something for something, not something for nothing."  A lie, couched in truth. The Welfare State is based on the principle that people on hard times were able to take advantage of benefits because, when in work, they paid into the system via taxes and National Insurance. That's the "something for something". It is  not  based on the idea that jobseekers have to take jobs off the market by doing them for free.  That 's just plain silly. 
 In fact, George,  you  are just plain silly. 
 So, returning to the question in our headline, it's clear to see the answer. 
 If anyone here is an April Fool, it 's George Osborne.

 Iain Duncan Smith's new plan to prolong child poverty

 Iain Duncan Smith wants to talk about child poverty - but how can we take him seriously when he starts the discussion with a lie? 
 "Recent analysis reveals that children are three times as likely to be in poverty in a workless family and there are now fewer children living in workless households than at any time since records began, having fallen by 274,000 since 2010," according to the Department for Work and Pensions' press release on the new consultation. 
 Oh really? 
 According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF), child poverty will rise from 2.5 million to 3.2 million during the 2010-2015 Parliament - around 24 per cent of all the children in the UK. By 2020, if the rise is not stopped, it will increase to four million - around 30 per centof all children in the UK. 
 Under the Coalition government, the number of people in working families who are living in poverty - at 6.7 million - has exceeded the number in workless and retired families who are in poverty - 6.3 million - for the first time. 
 The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has measured poverty, using several indicators, for more than 15 years; its figures are far more likely to be accurate than those of the government, which is still defining poverty as an income of less than 60 per cent of median (average) earnings. Average earnings are falling, so fewer people are defined as being in poverty - but that doesn't make the money in their pockets go any further. 
 "The previous government’s target to halve child poverty by 2010 was not achieved," states the DWP press release. Then it comes out with more nonsense: "The government is committed to ending child poverty in the UK by 2020 and the draft child poverty strategy sets out the government’s commitment to tackle poverty at its source." From the JRF figures alone,  we know that government policy is worsening the situation - or has everyone forgotten that 80,000 children woke up homeless last Christmas morning? 
 
 Let's look at the government's plans. 
 The DWP claims "reforming the welfare system through Universal Credit… will lift up to 300,000 children out of poverty, and cover 70 per cent of childcare costs for every hour worked". But we know that Universal Credit is effectively a benefit  cut  for everyone put onto it; they won't get as much as they do on the current benefits, and the one per cent uprating limit means falling further into poverty every year. Also, we found out this week that the housing element will be subject to sanctions if people in part-time jobs cannot persuade their employers to give them more hours of work.  The claim is ridiculous. 
 The DWP claims the government will will increase investment in the Pupil Premium, provide free school meals for all infant school children from September this year, improve teacher quality, fund 15 hours of free early education places per week for all three- and four-year-old children and extend 15 hours of free education and care per week to two-year-olds from low income families. None of these measures will do anything to "tackle poverty at its source".  Tackling poverty at its source means ending the  causes  of poverty, not putting crude metaphorical sticking-plasters over the effects - which could be removed at any time in the future. 
 The DWP claims the government will cut tax for 25 million people by increasing the personal tax allowance, and cut income tax for those on the minimum wage by almost two-thirds. This means people will have more money in their pocket - but will it be enough, when benefit cuts and sanctions are taken into account? Will their pay increase with the rate of inflation? There is no guarantee that it will.  And this move means the government will collect less tax, limiting its ability to provide services such as poverty-reduction measures. 
 The DWP claims the government will reduce water and fuel costs, and attack housing costs by building more homes. The first two measures may be seen as responses to aggressive policy-making by the Labour Party, and the last will only improve matters if the new dwellings are provided as social housing. Much of the extra spending commitment is made for 2015 onwards, when the Conservative-led Coalition may not even be in office. 
 These are plans to prolong poverty, not end it. 
 It is notable that the DWP press release repeats many of the proposals in an attempt to pretend it is doing more.  Take a look at the list  and count for yourself the number of times it mentions fuel/energy bills (three times) and free school meals (twice). 
 In fact, the only measures that are likely to help reduce the causes of poverty are far down the list: Increasing access to affordable credit by expanding credit unions and cracking down on payday lending (at the very bottom - and we'll have to see whether this really happens because payday lenders are generous donors to the Conservative party); and reviewing - mark that word, 'reviewing' - the national minimum wage, meaning that the government  might  increase the minimum wage in accordance with Low Pay Commission recommendations. 
 The DWP press release quotes Iain Duncan Smith, who said the consultation re-states the government's commitment to tackle poverty at its source, "be it worklessness, family breakdown, educational failure, addiction or debt". 
 The measures he has proposed will not improve anybody 's chance of finding a job, nor will they prevent family breakdown, or addiction. The plans for education have yet to be tested and may not work. The plan for debt involves annoying Conservative Party donors. 
 The JRF has  responded to the consultation  diplomatically, but there can be no mistaking the impatience behind the words of Chris Goulden, head of poverty research. He said: "Given that it has been over a year since the initial consultation on child poverty measures, we are disappointed that the government is now going to take even longer to agree what those indicators will be. 
 "With one in four families expected to be in poverty by 2020, a renewed strategy to address child poverty is vital. Any effective strategy should be based on evidence and contain measures to reduce the cost of living and improve family incomes. However, until those measures are agreed, it is difficult to see how the government can move forward." 
 Don't be too concerned about moving forward, Chris. 
 This government is backsliding.
