 Last February, Joseph Lewis wrote about  the 21st Century Career . One of the major points he discussed was the need to continue developing job skills outside of the nine to five job. However, resources are lacking in terms of just how to do this. 
 In case you missed what a 21st Century Career is, it entails a shift from working decades for the same business or industry, to a more serial style career where you progressively move up every 2-5 years in different companies.  Today a career isn’t defined so much by the company you work for, but by the unique set of job skills you acquire from experiences inside and outside of the workforce . 
 Like Joseph said, 
 
 “If your only professional endeavor is to spend 8 hours a day at a desk shuffling papers for someone who is ready to retire, then your career is already in trouble.” 
 
 So how do you succeed in a world that is quickly changing the idea of  the career ?

 It’s no secret that people who are  truly passionate  about their line of work tend to achieve more long term success than those who simply go where they believe their talents lie. They are more motivated to muscle through obstacles and take the risks they need to in order to move to the next level. 
 I’ve always believed that passion and success -- whether in the form of monetary wealth or personal fulfillment -- go hand in hand. But what do you do when you simply aren’t in touch with your passions? Or when you aren’t sure how your passions can translate into a viable career choice?  Click Here to Read Article …
