 Combine the following internship options: 
 Medicine and Nursing: St. Joseph Hospital (min. 1 week) 
 St. Joseph Hospital in Moshi Town 
 St. Joseph Hospital enables pre-medical, pre-nursing and pre-midwifery internships. You do not have to be enrolled in any university or nursing school. St. Joseph Hospital is located in downtown Moshi. Around 250 outpatients are treated every day, there are 150 beds and around 200-250 births per month. The hospital has 47 doctors, 38 nurses, 22 midwives and other staff such as physiotherapists, occupational therapists, pharmacists and administrative staff. Internships are possible in all departments of the hospital. 
 As a pre-intern, you mainly observe the specialists, but you can also help with simple assistance tasks under supervision. 
 There is an additional contribution of USD 200 per each month or part thereof. 
 Teaching: Kindergarten (min. 1 week) 
 Akili Kindergarten in Moshi Town 
 Akili Kindergarten in Moshi Town is attended by around 20 children every day. At the kindergarten you can support the educators in teaching simple English, numbers, ABC, singing, clapping and circle games, sporting activities or dancing as well as cooking, washing up and tidying up the kindergarten. You can also think of your own activities and implement them (e.g. "tooth brushing workshop"). 
 Teaching: Informal School (min. 1 week) 
 Informal Schools in Moshi 
 Informal schools are run by NGOs, churches and community initiatives, offering educational opportunities for children who for various reasons do not attend formal school. The informal schools prepare younger children for re-admittance to the governmental formal school system. In the case of adolescents, the informal schools usually impart basic knowledge that is needed for life, such as reading, writing, arithmetic, English, general knowledge and professional skills such as handicrafts, computer use, agriculture, tailoring, etc. 
 As an intern you will teach some of the subjects mentioned with local teachers, according to your interests and skills. 
 Day centres for special needs children (min. 1 week) 
 Special education, physiotherapy/occupational therapy: Day centres for children with special needs 
 In a day center for children with special needs, you can focus on special education (teaching) or physiotherapy / occupational therapy, depending on your interests. Placements are possible in various centers with different focuses. There are special educators and physiotherapists / occupational therapists who can provide you with internship supervision. 
 Social Work in Tanzania (min. 1 week) 
 Social Work: Children, Families, Women, HIV Patients 
 An internship is possible with an organization in Moshi that is active in the field of social work and supports children, women, families or HIV patients. You will get to know the work of social workers and assist with house visits and at centres that provide counselling and educational offers. 
 Veterinary Clinic (min. 1 week) 
 Veterinary Clinic Dr. Mnyoni 
 Veterinarian Dr. Mnyoni runs a veterinary clinic in Moshi Town, treating domestic animals such as dogs and cats and performing minor surgeries. There is also a shop for animal supplies. You will spend around half of your working hours in the clinic and the other half you accompany the vet treating farm animals such as cattle, pigs, chickens, goats, donkeys and poultry, for which the vet drives to farms and pastures throughout the Kilimanjaro region. You will observe the vet, get explanations and you can assist. African wild animals are not treated as they are under the remit of the National Park authorities. 
 Tree nursery and reforestation at Kilimanjaro (min. 1 week) 
 Tree nursery at Kilimanjaro 
 The tree nursery grows many species of indigenous trees as well as fruit trees. In tree-planting campaigns, especially during the rainy season, thousands of seedlings are planted in cleared areas. In addition to doing work at the tree nursery, you will also meet farmers in the village and help them grow corn, coffee, bananas and other crops. You will live in the village of Mweka on the slopes of Kilimanjaro in our World Unite! Forest Camp in a comfortable, fully furnished tent that you share with other participants (6-person tent) or, if you prefer, with a host family. 
 For this internship there is an additional one-time contribution for transport costs of 60 EUR (Moshi Town to Mweka and back). 
 Restaurant internship (min. 1 week) 
 Restaurant in Moshi Town 
 If you are interested in a career in the gastronomic sector or simply in African cuisine, you can do a restaurant internship in Moshi. We cooperate with several restaurants in the center of Moshi, which are aimed at a local middle class as well as tourists and usually offer a mixture of Tanzanian and international (Indian, Chinese, European) cuisine. You can assist in the kitchen and other service tasks of the restaurant. 
 Agricultural training center and production of building materials (min. 2 weeks) 
 Kilacha production and training center 
 The internship takes place in the Kilacha production and training center near Holili on the Tanzanian-Kenyan border, about 45km outside of Moshi Town. It is a technical college for agriculture with around 500 students as well as a production area for maize, vegetables, fodder plants, fish farming, chickens and pigs. The building materials department uses a stone crusher to produce gravel and makes building blocks and paving stones from concrete. 
 As an intern, depending on your interests, you can either work in agricultural production, in the manufacturing of building materials or in the preparation and implementation of the courses, or you can also combine. You can also take part in the courses offered by the training centre yourself, which are in English language. You will live on the premises of the Kilacha production and training center. 
 There is a one-time additional contribution of 100 USD per month or part thereof as well as a one-time contribution for transport costs of 60 EUR (Moshi Town to Holili and back). 
 And even more options to combine! 
 Zanzibar is just over an hour's flight from Kilimajaro. It is a tropical island paradise, where, just like in Moshi, we offer a selection of various  job orientation internships in Zanzibar . If you combine Moshi with Zanzibar, there are cheaper combination prices for our service package compared to individual bookings. Find details in the slider "Rates" below. 
 Full support prior to and during your time in Tanzania! 
 In Moshi Town you will live in a shared flat with other foreign interns. In the Forest Camp in Mweka (option: tree nursery) you will stay in a large, fully furnished 6-share tent which has its own bath and toilet, together with other participants or, if you prefer, with a host family in the village of Mweka, on full board. The agricultural Kilacha production and training center has its own staff accommodation, where you can book meals. Support is provided at all Tanzania locations by our 10-person team, which is led by Adelina from Tanzania and Miriam from Germany. We also have our own team members at the Forest Camp. This high level of support makes the job orientation internship also very suitable for younger participants (aged 16 and over) who are abroad for the first time for a longer period of time. Of course, you will also have a permanent contact person from our office team in Germany before and during your time in Tanzania! 
 As a participant of our job orientation internship, you will get a discount of EUR 50 on our  Career Counseling Test !

 Learning Swahili in Moshi!

You can choose the intensity of the lesson. We would, however, recommend a maximum of ten hours per week. The lessons are conducted individually; in some cases, 2-3 participants with similar levels of knowledge may be given combined lessons. The number of participants does not affect the cost of the lessons. 
 The cost for Swahili lessons: **1 Student: 8 EUR 
** 
 Please check "Language Training Required" in the registration form and specify your desired duration (minimum 20 hours). 
 Travel Health Insurance 
 We recommend the following travel insurance that is meant specifically for participants of internships, volunteering, language study, working holiday, and courses abroad. It is available for travelers of all nationalities and usable for all countries, except your home country. You can also add a journey liability insurance.

 Moshi 
 Check out our video on Moshi! 
 In this video, tourism intern Iris and our team member Adelina show us around Moshi Town and the surrounding areas. Adelina and Themi, two of our coordinators, introduce themselves. We also meet the volunteers Pia, who collaborates with the Social Reality Tour, and Laura in their host family. Coffee Farmer Dennis talks about coffee and we see a few shots from a Maasai Village. 
 Moshi at Kilimanjaro 
 Moshi is a town in the north of Tanzania, at the foot of Kilimanjaro. Here, you are in the middle of Africa and deal with people like the Chagga and Maasai. The city has about 150,000 inhabitants; however, it appears - like many African cities - much smaller, owing to the fact that many unplanned settlements are spread over long distances outside the city. Furthermore, the majority of the population do not have the purchasing power that would make transactions comparable to for instance a European city of this size. Nevertheless, Moshi is a relatively well-developed city and all necessities may be found here - from ATMs to specialty stores, restaurants to small supermarkets. 
 Moshi is the starting point of all Kilimanjaro climbs and many safaris to the Northern National Parks of Tanzania start from here. Kilimanjaro International Airport is about 40 km from Moshi. Tourism and trade of coffee and bananas have contributed to the flourishing of the city. 
 The city lies at an altitude of 813 m and has a year-round climate that people from moderate climates consider to be very comfortable (compared to the humid heat that often prevails on the coast or on the islands). 
 HIV and AIDS are the biggest problem - it is estimated that up to 16 % of the population are HIV-positive. The resulting problems are the countless orphans and street children, neglected people of retirement age and sick people, about whom no one cares because of lack of money. The other problems are poverty-related - lack of access to education, health care, infrastructure, and destruction of environmental resources such as deforestation. 
 Things to do in Moshi 
 Moshi is conveniently situated for safaris in all the Northern National Parks of Tanzania; you can travel over a weekend (Tarangire, Arusha National Park, Lake Manyara) or a multi-day tour (incl. Serengeti, Ngorongoro Crater and Conservation Area, Lake Eyasi, Lake Victoria, Lake Natron). The Kilimanjaro rises directly in front of your door - for a climb you need physical fitness and 5-7 days’ time. 
 As a day trip, you can visit the Marangu Waterfall and the village of Marangu with coffee plantations, the even higher Materuni waterfall, the Arusha National Park, a Maasai village, Lake Chala, swim in volcanic hot springs and hike on the slopes of Kilimanjaro. In Moshi, there are several cafes, restaurants, internet cafes, bars, discos, swimming pool and even an open- air cinema with karaoke. 
 Getting There 
 Getting To Moshi 
 You book your flight to Kilimanjaro International Airport (JRO). If the flights to Dar-es-Salaam (DAR) are much cheaper, you can also fly there and then book a separate connecting flight from DAR to JRO. From JRO airport, we pick you and take you to your accommodation in Moshi.
