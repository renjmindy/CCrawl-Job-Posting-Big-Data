 What Makes You Tick? 20 Questions To Help You Find The Right Career For You 
 8/12/2016 
  0 Comments  
 Did you vow to make this the year you figure out what you want to do and be post-baby? If you're not there yet, don't panic. There's still time to make progress before 2016 comes to an end. 
 Where should you start? Your very first move should be to get to know yourself better. The more you understand yourself and your motivations, the more informed and productive your career search process will be, and the more likely you'll find a career that is right for you. 
 We've put together a list of  20 self-discovery questions  to help you identify your values, strengths and passions. Download and print off the list, find some child-free time, and start working your way through the questions, jotting down your thoughts and ideas as you go. 
 If you have spent many years caught up in the whirlwind journey of motherhood, it might take a while for you to figure out what you really want for yourself moving forward. That's okay. Invest in your future by giving yourself the time and the space to take a step back, dig deep and dream big. And if you need more support, join our next monthly online JumpStart Your Career coaching programme. Click  here  to find out all the details, and read what other mums have to say about the programme. 
 You can find the list  here  in our Resource Hub. 
 We would love to know how you got on with this exercise. Please do leave a comment telling us what you discovered about yourself, and what you think your values, strengths and passions might be.
