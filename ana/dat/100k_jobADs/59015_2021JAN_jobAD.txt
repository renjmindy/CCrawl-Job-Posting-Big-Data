 Jobs: School Librarians

 10.25.17 -  School Librarian Positions 
TesJobs, UK 
 Sarah P 's comments : Fall is the time to begin to apply for international School Librarian positions. Although TIE ( The International Educator ) is US-based,  TES  is UK-based and free! They do tend to feature schools which offer the  British National Curriculum  and/or the IB ( International Baccalaureate ) however I have known folks to 'cross over' and my recommendation is to try and gain experience in as many systems as possible. By the end of my career, I could list 4 different curriculums and knowing them helped me to become a better librarian and educator (  not  Teacher-Librarian!) For more info about t\his subject, please read  Chapter 3  of my book and/or visit the  Book Resources  page. 
 TES currently has four jobs listed:
