 About this project 
 it-programming / others-5 
 USD 500 - 1,000 
 I need several hundred pairs of renders of simple uniform 3D objects in daylight and artificial light. For example, a render of a tomato in daylight and a render of the same tomato (same white empty background, same angle), but with artificial lighting. Then the script should load another 3D model, e.g. 
A banana, and then make two two renders of it as well. Repeat 100+ times. 
 I understand the objects should be similar and have similar materials for this process to be possible. I assume we can use a ready-made pack of simple food-related 3D models that are sold on the web. I'll purchase the one that is needed, but I need guidance from you regarding the best pack to buy. 
 Please find attached a photo example of the end result - a tomato in day lighting and in artificial lighting.
