 Introducing Liv, Creator Of theCramm + My New Job! 
 May 28, 2017May 28, 2017  /  Gracie 
 Hi Guys! 
 Today I'd like to introduce you to a friend of mine, Olivia (Liv) Seltzer. She is an amazing and passionate young person and the creator of a brilliant movement called  theCramm . I have recently joined the team to help Liv out on her mission and I must say, I am enjoying it immensely. 
 Liv is a blogger, so some of you may know her, though she doesn't post anymore. She now focuses all of her time and attention on theCramm. 
 Let me tell you about it. TheCramm aims to inspire, empower and inform today's young people. Each morning, Liv gets up at 5am, reads all the latest world news and then writes humourous, relatable and engaging newsletters for 13-30 year olds all over the planet. She believes that you can't change the world without knowing about it. 
 I have now taken on the role of her researcher, which is an incredible opportunity for me. To read my stories in her words, please visit  theCramm website  and sign up for the e-newsletters or texts. Liv and I would both really appreciate it. You'll be motivated to make a difference and have a smile on your lips from Liv's great sense of humour. Please please please sign up today! Thank you very much. 
 **What are your thoughts? Are you going to support theCramm? Are you someone who wants to change the world? Have you got any feedback on theCramm for Liv and I? Don 't hesitate to let me know! **

 I know! I was thinking, "Wow, we have a really similar sense of humor!" when I was reading some of her Cramms.

 That's kind of cool! I think it's critical that youth are actively knowledgeable about current events, and I think this is a great way to mobilize some of that!
