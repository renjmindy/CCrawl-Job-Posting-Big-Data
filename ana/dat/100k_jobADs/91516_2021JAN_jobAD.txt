 Heats School of Welding Technology 
 Philippines is now facing an increasing rate of unemployment everyday. It is a fact announced daily on TVs and printed media which is a result of Economic downturn worldwide. But despite the hardships, Filipinos' character of patience and hardwork will always emerge because Pinoys are natural survivors. There maybe a decreasing demand on wirings, computers, electronic and other related industries but a number of identified skills are still in demand. 
 One of thriving opportunity for Filipinos abroad is the Welding Industry. The Demand for this specific skill is increasing recently. Surprisingly, this is not just a man's job anymore as for the latest development, women are already starting to try this area. 
 The Philippine Government has encouraged Filipino entrepreneurs to open up welding training centers to cope up with the increasing demands for Filipino welders. In my area in particular, there are newly opened technical school offering welding related courses.  Heats School of Welding Technology  is one good example. Heats started to hold trainings in 2008 by renting private rooms. Most of the participants are now working abroad. 
 
 Engr. Pedro Jose Jr. 
 The good man behind this project is  Engr. Pedro Jose Jr.  He is a native of Kapanikian, Lapaz, Tarlac. He has been in the field of Welding, QA/QC and Inspection for the past 14 years in the Philippines, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Indonesia and Brunei. 
 His Noble Mission for the School is to produce World Class Pinoy Welders, Welding Inspectors & other skilled workers. To realize this mission, he turned his home into a Technical School to help not only his fellow Tarlaqueño but his fellow Pinoys from adjacent areas as well. 
 Heats School of Welding Technology is now in the process of TESDA Accreditation and according to TESDA personnel, their accreditation documents will be released this February 2009. HEATS' building, classrooms, facilities (such as Welding booths, working table and grinding table), welding machines, tools and materials are now in place and ready. 
 Pictures below are the proof of Mr. Jose's humble attempt to turn this project into reality.
