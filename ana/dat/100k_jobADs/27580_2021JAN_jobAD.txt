 The most overrated jobs of 2013 
 9/24/2013 
  1 Comment  
 When reading this article: 
 http://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-most-overrated-jobs-of-2013-192901302.html 
(the part about the Stockbroker is funny, I quote directly from the article: 
"Most trading is automated, staring at a computer screen. Compensation, while good, is not phenomenal--they're not rolling in money," Lee said. 
 But wait, you say. The market is at an all-time high! 
 In fact, market volatility has taken an already high-stress job to meteoric levels of stress. And you know what the biggest complaint from clients is now in this market? 
 "They're not making enough money!" Lee said. 
 Plus, they don't have the budgets they used to, so there aren't as many steak dinners with clients as there used to be.") 
 What are your thoughts on the article?

 It is funny with these jobs that are listed in the true reality of the level of stress and work that each position requires.
