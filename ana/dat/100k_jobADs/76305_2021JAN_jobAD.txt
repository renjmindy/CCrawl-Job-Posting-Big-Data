 Microsoft Ignite US 2017 - Major Azure Announcements 
 10 October 201728 April 2018 Mr. Fox SQL (Rolf Tesmer) Leave a comment 
 [ read this post on Mr. Fox SQL blog ] 
 Microsoft Ignite  is probably the  biggest  technical event that Microsoft host yearly with many  major announcements  across the  entire solutions portfolio suite  -  and this year 2017 was certainly no exception to that ! 
 This year it was held in  Orlando, FL  over  5 days (25 - 29 Sep)  and was  attended by more than 30,000 people  across the two major events of  Ignite  and  Envision.  The event covers all areas of Microsoft solutions including  Azure, Office, Power BI, SQL Server, Windows, Dynamics  , etc, etc and is a  world of technical goodness ! 
 The announcements across the  Azure Cloud  space in particular are  significant and very exciting  , and provide a  strong lead  as to the direction Microsoft are taking their technologies today - and in the very near future. 
 I have prepared a  summary deck  of what I think are the  major announcements  specifically across the  Azure Infrastructure and Data  space which are important to be aware of. There are of course  even more  announcements that this across other solutions areas I mentioned above that I haven't covered in this deck. 
 You can download the **Azure Data & Infra ** announcements  deck from  [MY PRESENTATIONS]  page here on my blog site **Ignite US 2017 Announcements - ** https://mrfoxsql.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/azure_igniteus2017_whatsnew_v0-21.pdf 
 In addition to all the  technical goodness  -  Satya  also released a new book called "  Hit Refresh  " which outlines the  inside story  of  Microsoft 's own digital transformation . 
 
 Hit Refresh  is about individual change, about the transformation happening inside of Microsoft and the technology that will soon impact all of our lives—the arrival of the most exciting and disruptive wave of technology humankind has experienced: artificial intelligence, mixed reality, and quantum computing. 
 
 You can read about it here - and also grab a copy if interested to learn more -  https://news.microsoft.com/hitrefresh/ 
 Happy reading! 
 … AND of course, as I always say,  please review and validate this yourself as your required outcomes may vary!

 What Exactly is the "Data Platform" Nowadays? 
 19 April 201728 April 2018 Mr. Fox SQL (Rolf Tesmer) 1 Comment 
 [ read this post on Mr. Fox SQL blog ] 
 A couple of months ago I was presenting at  SQL Saturday Melbourne (582)  on  Azure Cognitive Services  and got chatting with some of the other presenters about our sessions. 
 I co-presented with  Krissy Rumpff  from  Microsoft Data Platform Team  ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/krumpff/ ) - and for those interested our session is here -  http://www.sqlsaturday.com/582/Sessions/Details.aspx?sid=56483  …or… **you can look at the recording here - ** https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Ignite/Australia-2017/DA321 
 Anyway, whats interesting is that some of the other presenters were asking why we were presenting on  Cognitive Services  , when in fact this was  SQL Saturday ? And,  you know  ,  Cognitive is not the Data Platform? 
 This is actually an **interesting point - **and since then I have had a pretty good think about what this means - and so  this is the purpose of this blog post!

 PASS - A Business Case for Attendance 
 26 April 201628 April 2018 Mr. Fox SQL (Rolf Tesmer) Leave a comment 
 [ read this post on Mr. Fox SQL blog ] 
 For those tech professionals who play in the  SQL Server and Business Intelligence  world (  and let me say that 's a huge number! ) the  PASS Summit  provides one of the most fantastic and focused learning and networking experiences available. 
 I simply  cannot think of any other SQL/BI event  that brings together such a range of deep expertise and learning, open networking opportunities, knowledge sharing and community involvement than that of  PASS . In fact I know of several of my Aussie counterparts whom attend no other training throughout the year except for the complete 5 day immersion that only PASS can offer. 
 For those new to  PASS  - see here  http://www.sqlpass.org/summit/2016/Welcome.aspx 
 I have attended a few  PASS  events now (  and have been lucky enough to present in 2015!  ) and each event has been better than the last. With the  Call For Speakers  now closed I can see that this year's  PASS 2016 in Seattle (Oct 25-28)  is shaping up to be yet another fire cracker! 
 Will I be presenting this year?  Well, I actually didn't submit any extracts. I started a job with  Microsoft  (Azure) and needed to focus on the ever expanding learning curve! 
 Anyway - I have blogged about my experiences submitting and attending PASS many times… 
 
 **Submitting - ** https://mrfoxsql.wordpress.com/2015/09/01/experiences-of-submitting-a-pass-2015-session/ 
 **Attending (one of many) - ** https://mrfoxsql.wordpress.com/2015/10/29/pass-2015-session-report-keynote-and-sql-server-on-azure-virtual-machines-features-best-practices-roadmap/ 
 
 Unfortunately  such amazing resources don't always come free and these uncertain financial times can create an uncertain training budget for many organisations and individuals alike. 
 As such for those attendees whom find themselves in this position I have  prepared a brief below  which can hopefully help you prepare a convincing  business case for attendance . This is one I wrote a few years back after presenting at a few SQL Saturday and PASS virtual chapter sessions and helped me position the key benefits of PASS. 
 Take from this what you will - and be sure to update this with the most recent content and also to reflect your personal and business circumstances. 
 GOOD LUCK! And I hope to see you at PASS !

 House Price Predictions @ PASS 2015 
 8 September 20158 September 2015 Mr. Fox SQL (Rolf Tesmer) Leave a comment 
 The  PASS speakers  were announced a quite a number of weeks ago now for  PASS 2015  in October - and I felt pretty damn  honored  to be one of the 160 or so selected to speak at the conference (…  and as a quick aside I also note a reasonably large contingent of Aussie & Kiwi presenters too! ). 
 It will be my 2nd conference, and first time speaking at it. 
 Exciting?   Absolutely!   Nervous?   Absolutely! 
 So what is my topic I hear you  think  - and why might it be interesting to  you ? (read on!)

 Experiences of Submitting a PASS Session

 It will be my 2nd conference,  but first time speaking at it. 
 It actually came as a (  welcome !) surprise having attended my first  PASS  in  2014  (actually on recommendation of fellow Aussie  Rob Farley  ) and then to go-on and submit a session for  PASS 2015  (on suggestion of  yet another  fellow Aussie  Victor Isakov  ). 
 Both guys are also presenting at PASS 2015, checkout their sessions. 
 So what was my experience of submitting a PASS session, and how did the process unfold ? (read on!)

 Mr. Fox SQL Blog… 
 2 April 201520 June 2015 Mr. Fox SQL (Rolf Tesmer) 
 So I've decided that its finally time I took a  bite out of the magic apple  and started doing some  Blogging . 
 Starting a blog has been on my mind for some time (  read years  ), and I never really got onto it mostly due to timing issues. 
 As a  SQL Consultant  I've read, accessed and joined in on many blogs over the years and its been (quite frankly) invaluable, so this is an opportunity to share some of my own interesting things that I have picked up over the past years (which is  my part  to do), and with some patience and luck (which is  your part  to do) I hope that you find them interesting too! 
 So this is essentially the first blog post of (hopefully) many! 
 So stick around and  follow  if interested - ! 
 Lastly, my personal caveat, SQL is a  large and complex product,  so keep in mind  nothing  can be tested or investigated from every angle 100% of the time and so there may be inaccuracies or limitations.  Constructive feedback is appreciated and I can correct where applicable! 
 If you want to know a few things  About Me  then go  here
