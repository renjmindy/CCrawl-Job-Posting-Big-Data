 Toohotmama's "Cool-Chick" Award 
 IDA ROCKS! 
 
 Ida Hayes-Green Graduates High School at 99! 
 Ida Hayes-Green finally got her high school diploma, one month before her 99th birthday, just last week. 
 She’s been very busy with all the attention, but when that dies down,  Toohotmama’s  intend to contact her for an interview. Enquiring minds want to know what colleges she’s targeting. 
 Dudette! What’s your major? And we’ve got some serious advice about dorm life. Stay away from the all you can eat ice-cream machine. They’re not kidding about the whole 'Freshman 10'. And unless you’re into drunken, one night stands, avoid the Frat parties. On the subject of Dead-week… Okay. We won't go there. 
 Waiting until Finals to cram might work, especially for those of us with short-term memory loss, so what the heck. Give it a try. Beyond that, enjoy. These next four years will fly by and before you know it? You’re 103. Congratulations, Ida Hayes-Green! You're our hero and one Hot Mama!

 Bad Hair

 The 35 Symptoms of Menopause  :  A continuing education . Today, we explore  Symptom #26: 
 Hair loss or thinning head or pubic hair. Increase in facial or whole body hair. 
 So many of our friends complain about this symptom. The hair falls off the head and seems to just explode out of everywhere else. 
 So, girls. How do we get rid of unwanted hair without the hideous pain of waxing / electrolysis and those horrible red bumps that come after shaving? Well, after a LOT of debate-and experimentation-we've come to the conclusion that there is no solution. Why are we fighting the inevitable, ladies? 
 Let go of your inhibitions. If you've got it, flaunt it. Embrace your inner gorilla! Oh, we're not saying it will be easy. The first time we hit the beach sporting our new hirsute look, we were a little bashful. But as you can see by the video our husband's shot, (above) after a couple Mai Tai's we got into the rhythm.

 The World's Oldest Author, and it ain't me! 
 Wendy! 
 Number one son just brought home the Guinness Book of World Records and yes!! There is hope for our careers!! 
 Apparently, Louise Delany and her sister, Elizabeth Delany published their second book,  The Delany Sisters ' Book of Everyday Wisdom'  back in 1994, when she was just 105 years old. I don't know about you, but this puts a HUGE gust of wind in my sails. I'm not even  half  her age yet. You know, we outta think about doing a book together one day, in say…50 or 60 years. Yeah, sure, we'd be all done with menopause, so we'd have to think up some new thing to gripe…er, offer wisdom about, but I say let's go for it! 
 I'm gonna go to Amazon now, and see if I can get ahold of a copy of their book. It's my new holy grail.

 Crazy, Sexy Menopause! 
 
 
 Wendy and Carolyn are two long time friends and romance novelists. Together, they are trying to juggle Marriage, Motherhood and Menopause while keeping their sense of humor. And they said it couldn't be done...
