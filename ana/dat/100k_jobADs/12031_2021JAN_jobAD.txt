 Live-in Childcare Jobs in Canada 
 Posted on  February 12, 2009  by  caregiver 
 A caregiver recruitment agency based in Canada whose main objective is to recruit the best child caregivers locally or around the world is seeking qualified applicants to fill the caregiver needs of their clients. With an international network of affiliate offices, they aim to help Canadians find the right caregivers for their children by providing them with the perfect candidate for their childcare needs using their cutting-edge video resume system. 
 Most of their clients are willing to be a caregiver work abroad sponsor and the Canadian immigration process wouldn’t be much of a problem. That’s because the agencies founder himself is a Canadian immigration lawyer and has helped thousands of people immigrate to Canada since 1991.
