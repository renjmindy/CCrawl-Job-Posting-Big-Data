 POWER prays for jobs 
 Mar  30 
 ********What would you say if you were hurrying to catch a plane and saw 36 people walking through the concourse and praying? 
 A group of that size might not be intimidating if it weren’t for their activity. This scene occurred today at Philadelphia International Airport with Bishop Dwayne Royster leading his interfaith group, Philadelphians Organized to Witness, Empower and Rebuild ( POWER ). Members of the clergy representing Christian, Jewish and Muslim faiths directed their prayers to the need for jobs and in particular, at the Philadelphia airport. Their goal is that the Lord will direct Mayor Nutter to go forward with the proposed expansion of the airport. 
 Not to detract from their mission, but it does make you wonder if they prayed with their eyes shut – I often pray when I’m driving, so I know that the Lord hears even though my eyes are open and my head is looking forward instead of bowed. Were they praying aloud? Were they taking turns or praying all at the same time? I guess it does not matter. God is all present, all knowing and all powerful, so it would not have bothered Him. Would their actions have bothered you?
