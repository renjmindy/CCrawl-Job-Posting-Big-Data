 Gleeson are working with a Retail organisation who have shown no signs of slowing down and are actively looking for a Qualified (ACA, ACCA, CIMA) Finance Manager to join the team. The role will lead a small team and take ownership for the monthly management accounts and support the commercial and operational teams. 
 The business has recently restructured their finance team and with a new FD in place, they now need a confident Finance Manager to take ownership of the monthly management accounts which is currently closed in 7 days, and requires a hands on Accountant who can identify and implement processes to speed this up. The role will be supported by a Qualified Management Accountant who will own the majority of the hands on tasks, however, they will still need additional support and ongoing development. 
 Due to their business model, they have seen significant growth over the past 3 months which has seen an increase in sales and seen them take market share away from their competitors. As the Finance Manager this role will offer lots of business partnering exposure and will need someone who enjoys building relationships. A main point of contact will be the Operational Director who looks after Customer service, logistics and the warehouse. They will need constant support to ensure accurate budgets and forecasts are in place and cost savings can be implemented. 
 With so much variety on offer the role will keep any Accountant busy, and due to the continuous growth there is a unique opportunity to add real value and improve profitability. The business are happy to offer flexibility and are happy with 2/3 days working from home. 
 Package on offer: 
 
 £45,000 - £50,000 
 Bonus 
 25 days holiday 
 £700 yearly discount
