 Who are Buzzbike? 
 Buzzbike is revolutionising the way that we travel within cities, with a mission to disrupt the way you move by changing the way you own, empowering active, urban mobility to build a better tomorrow. We provide our riders with everything they need to get started: a premium bike, high quality lock, on-demand maintenance, a bike replacement service in case of theft, and our app which incentivises and rewards you the more you ride. And our Bike Professors (next level mechanics) and Rider Happiness team will be on hand to ensure a smooth ride at every step of the way. All this for a monthly subscription you can cancel any time. 
 But getting members on a Buzzbike is just the beginning. We have ambitious plans to build and curate an urban cycling community, that anyone can be a part of. With rider events and lots more - we hope to get everyone in the city on a Buzzbike. 
 Lockdown has changed a lot in the world of business, and it has provided the cycling world with a unique opportunity to help reshape city transport - with cycling lanes popping up across London - and Buzzbike is at the leading edge of this movement. With a massive commitment to sustainability, and improving the health and happiness of cities in the process, this is a fantastic opportunity to be a part of the future of city cycling. 
 Described by the Guardian as the "the Netflix for Bikes", Buzzbike is backed by the Adidas family and the Chairman of Brompton Cycles. Check out www.buzzbike.cc to find out more about us and our mission.
