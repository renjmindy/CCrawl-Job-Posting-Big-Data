 About the Job 
 Our growth and expansion means that our consumer web application needs to be highly polished, yet designed with sufficient flexibility to add new products, customize workflows, and cobrand with our partners. We also develop and maintain internal applications that provide significant leverage to our operations teammates. The backend that runs all of this is evolving toward an event sourced architecture that supports the highly asynchronous and multi-modal workflows we are automating. Our current stage provides a engineering manager with a healthy mix of familiar and novel challenges, and a high degree of agency to solve them.

 Passionate software engineer that loves building polished products 
 Collaborator that thrives in a social atmosphere and actively contributes to improving processes, workflows, and communication 
 People person and leader with transparent approach to team management 
 Maker who doesnâ€™t relent until finding a both elegant and practical solution to a problem 
 Systems thinker who understands the value of automation and infrastructure as code 
 Quick study that readily picks up new languages, frameworks, and tools 
 Person who cares deeply that your work realizes positive outcomes for our world 
 
 What we are looking for 
 There are always exceptions, and we are looking for exceptional individuals, so  nothing on this list is strictly required . However, if some of these match your experiences, then you would likely thrive in this role: 
 
 Built software utilizing functional programming patterns and primitives (Either/Maybe, Option, IO, do notation, for comprehension, etc) 
 Experience managing teams and recruiting new engineers. 
 Built and maintained web services that were subjected to a high request volume 
 Implemented monitoring and alerting to understand the health of the apps and diagnose issues 
 Utilized a variety of databases for different use cases (e.g., relational, document, graph, object storage) 
 Scaled out infrastructure using automation tooling (e.g., Pulumi, Terraform, CDK) 
 Used functional programming libraries, and/or functional programming languages in general 
 Experience with consumer facing applications 
 
 Technologies we teach and use 
 
 TypeScript, Scala, Ruby, Python 
 Pure FP TypeScript libraries (fp-ts, io-ts, matechs) 
 Postgresql, Redis, FireStore, BigQuery, S3/GCS 
 Google Firebase, Apache Beam, Scio, Rails 
 Heroku, Google Cloud (PubSub, Functions, and others) 
 Rollbar, Segment, CodeFresh, LogDNA 
 
 Perks 
 
 Flexible hours and remote work 
 Fantastic health, dental, and vision 
 Three weeks of annual PTO 
 6-10 weeks of parental leave 
 Culture focused on cross-functional collaboration 
 Early stage equity 
 Lots of choice in workstation, peripherals, tools, etc.

 Coworkers are passionate about working in our customersâ€™ best interests
