 I have a sentence in my testbook: "Teaching reading is a ___ job." 
 With such options for the blank: 
 most satisfying 
most satisfied 
mostly satisfied 
most satisfaction 
 I believe the first answer is fittest the best, but I don't understand why there's the article "a" before "most". I learned that we should always use the article "the" before "easiest", "most", "smartest", etc. Are there exceptions?

 Here are some threads on the topic: 
 a most important one   'the' most important one' 
 A most worthwhile/the most worthwhile 
 If these do not answer your question, please join the discussion in any relevant thread. I'll close this thread to prevent duplication.
