 If your work gets you down and you feel what you’re doing every day is beneath you, how do you keep up with the daily grind? 
 I’ve been there. I was an intern working at a job that didn’t feel like it was contributing to the world’s wellbeing as much as pushing numbers around. I was there again when I started my first business, setting up web sites and getting caught up in the little stuff all the time. 
 I knew I had a lot more in me to give, but the day to day work I was doing was not of the calibre I knew it could be. But it was paying the rent and putting food on the table.  Click Here to Read Article …

 As Woodrow Wilson once remarked, “  We are not here to merely earn a living and to create value for our shareholders. We are here to enrich the world and make it a finer place to live. We will impoverish ourselves if we fail to do so.” 
 Are you really happy at work?  Do you jump out of bed each morning and look forward to getting started at your true calling? Do you have a  great sense of fulfillment from your job ? If the answer to any of these is ‘NO’ for you, then you may want to read on to discover why this is happening and what you can do about it.  Click Here to Read Article …

 You know the type …it may even be you. 
 That certain individual in the workplace who seems to get by on doing the least amount possible. It is frustrating when you're working harder and they're getting the same amount of credit. Although rare, it's painful to attempt to distinguish yourself if everyone is assigned virtually the same job.That being said, in order to grow in your personal workspace and prove your value amidst co-workers and omnipotent bosses, you must actively seek out tasks, projects and ideas. 
 Armed and Ready 
 When faced with lazy and defiant co-workers, there is only so much energy that can be expelled into making them tolerable to deal with. Since some of us are extremely ambitious and learn best by doing things independently, we are inspired on our terms. Others require being told and shown. Which is where showcasing your particular earnest for a job yields varying results depending on who you are dealing with. 
 I'm a firm believer in kids needing to be inspired by someone or something in order to achieve things in life. The same can be said for adults who end up in a work environment that may not be their calling. People generally think well of and enjoy talking about themselves. You can learn immense amounts with active listening. Too many of us can't wait to spit our next thought out only to have missed the punchline. 
 After working a number of random jobs, I've learned that tapping into another person's interest is an easy and promising way to gain their trust. Through that connection you are able to find a way to get them more 'in the game' at work. Humor, when used correctly (no racist, sexist or grossly foul jokes); food, (ensuring that allergic concerns are addressed); discussing family pets and giving genuine compliments all work towards your success. Lazy workers dispel 'against the grain' personality types because they raise the bar for what's expected at work and while change is a vital part of life, we tend to resist it. Disturb the stagnant water that is workplace politics and be prepared for a ripple effect.
