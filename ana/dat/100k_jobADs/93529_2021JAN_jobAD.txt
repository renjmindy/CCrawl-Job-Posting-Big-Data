 Facebook Jobs Opportunities 
 December 26, 2020   lowerbackpainrelief123 
 Have you ever wondered about Facebook Jobs? 
 Well In this short guide, you are going to learn exactly how you can start earning money in as little as 24 hours, doing the things that you already do on Facebook! 
 Did you know that social media has become one of the biggest drivers of sales and new customers for businesses? Companies that used to spend millions of dollars on radio advertising, TV commercials and billboard signs are now shifting huge chunks of their marketing budgets to social media sites like Facebook. So why are they doing this? The simple answer is….. 
 Social Proof 
 What do you think is more valuable to a business? Someone seeing an advertisement from a business that says: ‘Buy our new smartphone, it has great features and is reasonably priced!’ Or that same person seeing a Facebook status update from their friend saying: LOVE my new XYZ smartphone, the camera on it is amazing Of course, it’s the latter. And that’s why social media is so powerful for business. 
 What you may not realise though, is that you have unwittingly become an unpaid marketing agent for these companies! Every time you mention a business on Facebook, recommend a product or service, or ‘like’ a businesses page, you are making that business money. 
 And what do you get in return? Nothing. Does it seem fair to you that these businesses should be making all this money of the back of your time and efforts, while you

 Imagine if you could get paid for the actions you take on Facebook 
How great would it be if you could get paid every time you ‘liked’ a page, shared an article or left a comment. 
Instead of wasting all those hours, you spend on Facebook, you could turn them into a way to make some extra cash. That would be pretty awesome, right? Well, now you can! And the key to all of this is affiliate marketing. 
 Why not Get paid for what you already do? 
 For example, a business that sells a weight loss program online for $100, may have an affiliate program that pays 50% commission for each sale you help them generate. You could join this affiliate program and then get paid for telling people about the businesses website. As the affiliate program pays 50% commission and the product sells for $100, you would get paid $50 for each customer that you send to that businesses website. It’s that easy. If you were an affiliate for this weight loss course, all you would need to do is find people who are interested in weight loss, get them to click on your affiliate link (which will take them to the businesses website) and then you get paid $50 for every person that buys the product. Facebook is the perfect place to make money doing this as an affiliate because through their Facebook accounts people tell you exactly what they are interested in (and therefore what they may be interested in buying!).
