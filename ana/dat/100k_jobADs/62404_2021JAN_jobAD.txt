 You will be joining a small but strong team building a fair and cooperative insurance product without the "necessary evil" parts that seem to permeate the industry. 
 We use Scala on the backend and Scala.js with React on the frontend. Our codebase is pragmatically functional, with Cats, Monix, GraphQL, event sourcing. We have interesting challenges in all parts of the stack. 
 Our workflow is truly remote with team members located in US, Canada, and Europe. Our processes are fluid and lightweight, and of course you'll have a say in that kind of thing. 
 Role 
 
 Develop our Scala.js React web app and backend Scala services 
 Collaborate with our designer on UI and UX 
 Take loose problem statements and deliver appropriate solutions end-to-end 
 Engage in thoughtful peer reviews, set the right kind of quality bar 
 
 Requirements 
 
 Intermediate to Senior level; solid skills in Scala 
 Experience with either React or Scala.js 
 Effective communication in a remote-first workflow 
 Desire to fix a backward industry that is built on poor customer experiences 
 Passion for building things from concept to implementation to production 
 
 Nice to have 
 
 Focus on correctness, understanding of functional programming (monix / cats / fs2 / etc.) 
 Contributions to open source projects 
 Understanding of accounting and money moving fundamentals

 Goodcoverâ€™s mission is to build a community of members enjoying financial peace of mind at the lowest possible cost. Our first service offering is better Renters Insurance at half the cost of legacy providers. To reinvent the insurance experience we adopted a cooperative model to put Members first and introduced a radical idea â€“ money not needed to pay claims is returned back to our Members through our Annual Dividend. We believe premiums are for your protection, not to fatten our profit. Bundled with our easy digital-first experience and human touch support, Goodcover is insurance designed for the modern era.
