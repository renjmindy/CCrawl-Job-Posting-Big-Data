 How Promising Managers Sometimes Derail Their Careers‚Ä¶and How to Prevent It 
 Posted on  April 19, 2012  by  Rachel Collis 
 According to  The Centre for Creative Leadership  almost 1 in 2 of the managers who have the makings of success fail to reach their potential. They 'derail' and are either demoted, fired, plateau or opt for early retirement ( William A Gentry ). 
 There seem to be some  key problems that cause this derailment : 
 
 Failing to build effective interpersonal relationships 
 Showing poor team leadership 
 Having problems adapting to changes in the environment 
 Lacking growth and development in the face of the changing demands of their role 
 Failing to meet business objectives (due to either failing to follow through or being overambitious ) 
 Maintaining a narrow focus, so that they aren't able to supervise outside of their area of functional expertise 
 
 What seems to happen is that these managers are defensive in the face of challenging feedback, don't learn from their mistakes and don't identify and address their weaknesses. 
 Why do they do that? 
 I suspect that they lack self-compassion. Self-compassion makes it  easier to be open to difficult feedback; learn from mistakes  and admit failings. Self compassion can  probably be increased *. 
 These managers also need to get better at noticing when their approach is ineffective and then quickly adjusting their behaviour. A starting point here may be to learn to  become more mindful  and psychologically flexible. 
 So, if you are a beginning manager, it might be good to focus on becoming more mindful,  flexible  and  compassionate . 
 
 For readers based in Brisbane, I am running a low cost  public workshop  on self-compassion on Sunday 6th May 2012.

 Great insight - we can only grow when we recognise that we are imperfect. And we can only do that when we feel safe that we'll forgive ourselves for not being perfect. Business culture sometimes glorifies perfectionism. Very insightful, sure it will be a worthwhile seminar.
