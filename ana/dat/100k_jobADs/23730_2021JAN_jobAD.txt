 Great advice: applying to jobs on KamaKazi 
 Great advice from KamaKazi.co.ke , whose website has hundreds of jobs to apply to… 
 We wanted to give you some pointers as to our application process to help you out: 
 
 Always read the Job Description (JD) carefully and make sure you understand what skills and experience you have for this job. When we call you for interview and you say ‘I can do it!’ that is not enough! Simply not enough. We want to hear what experience you have in the past that shows us you have done something similar. And we want to see that you understand the skills required and can show you have those skills from past experiences. 
 Application – we ask that you apply for every job you want to – one application is not enough. Why? Similarly to the above we want to know that you have read the JD and understood it for each job rather than simply applying for multiple jobs. 
 Skills – We ask that you fill in a section for skills. These are NOT your generic skills. They are skills SPECIFIC to this job description. If you do not demonstrate here that you have the specific skills that the job is looking for we may not even consider your application. 
 IT Skills – again we want to see if you have read the JD and understood what IT skills are imperative to this job. 
 
 Then you must attach your CV and any documentation that is RELEVANT to the job. Qualifications, certificates and recommendation letters are good.
