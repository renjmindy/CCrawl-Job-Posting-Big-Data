 Job Description 
 Your vibe and experience 
 You are trustworthy and have trust in others. You’re a curious mind. You love to see how things work and are fascinated by the intricacies of objects. You’re good with your hands and mechanically adept. You’re always willing to learn and grow. You remain cool, calm and collected in a fast-paced environment. You’d rather do a job right the first time, than do it twice.

 Maintaining a clean, safe, and secure work environment for guests, coworkers, and yourself, leveraging your knowledge of safety regulations and equipment.

Managing priorities, staying organized, and keeping on top of the various tasks with limited supervision. 
 Our offer 
 Working with us means that you will have the opportunity to earn and learn, flexibility, and a safe and inclusive work environment. What this means in practice is: 
 Access to education and skills development opportunities that take you further 
A total rewards package that includes discounts, incentives, and recognition perks 
Flexible hours/shifts that suit your needs 
A safe, respectful and inclusive workplace 
Bring your authentic self to work – welcoming people of every age, background, and culture – just like the guests who visit our restaurants every day

 About us 
 In 1954, an enterprising salesman named Ray Kroc discovered a small burger restaurant in California, and wrote the first page of McDonald’s history. In 1967, the first McDonald’s Canada opened in Richmond, B.C. and we’ve been growing with our communities and serving quality food at great a value ever since. Today, McDonald’s Canada is proud to be one of the world’s leading foodservice retailers, offering job opportunities at corporate-owned restaurants or restaurants owned by independent franchisees.
