 Despite what you might think, finding work-at-home jobs isn't that difficult. The problem is that most people search for the wrong jobs in the wrong places. Work-at-home jobs are similar to traditional jobs. What they aren't is envelopes stuffing, assembling work, email processing and all the other scams you find online. 
 Work-At-Home Success posts many free jobs, but its only a small smidgen of the actual number of home-based jobs that are available. So while you can  check WAHS for jobs , don't be afraid to search for jobs on your own. 
 Here are some tips for searching and applying to work-at-home jobs: 
 
 
 Be sure you've read the  Scam Alert page  and know how to weed out scams and schemes. 
 
 
 Inventory your skills, experiences, talents, and passions. Similar to a traditional job search, you need to look for jobs that fit the skills you have to offer an employer. 
 
 
 Be prepared to tailor your resume to fit each job you apply to. 
 
 
 Follow the steps and resources below to find jobs. 
 
 
 Directions for Searching for Jobs 
 
 Click on the job search links below. 
 Be sure to register so you can get the full list of search results. 
 Read the directions for each specific site. 
 Use keyword "work at home" (with quotes) or "telecommute" to conduct your search on general job search sites. Leave the other fields (location and industry) to "all" to get all possible work-at-home job announcements. 
 Read through the many job opportunities listed to find those that interest you. Please make yourself familiar with how to weed out  scams and biz ops  as the free sites are full of them. 
 Apply following the employer's directions. 
 
 Job Search Sites 
 The best sites for work-at-home jobs are the telecommuting databases, which are not free. However, I have tested the ones listed below and can assure you they offer good resources of jobs. If you are really serious about finding a legitimate work-at-home job, I believe these are the best resources for you. However, if you aren't sure or are just starting your search, use one of the free general job search sites (follow the directions above) listed below. 
 Telecommuting Job Databases  (fee required to access these services) 
 FlexJobs  - Has tons of work-at-home and flexible job options plus a personalized login system that will identify jobs that fit your criteria, ability to have multiple resume profiles, job search tips and checklists, and much more! For the number of jobs and added service, its a must use for the serious work-at-home job hunter. 
 ** HomeJobStop  **has over 100 jobs in clerical, and more in customer service, writing, transcription, miscellaneous plus 100′s of others. Very affordable. 
 Free job search sites  (you need to search by keyword to find work-at-home jobs on these sites). 
 Indeed Telecommuting Jobs 
 Monster.com 
 Beyond.com- Check out this video on how to find work-at-home jobs  on Beyond.com. 
 Job.com 
 Yahoo! Hot Jobs 
 CraigsList.org 
 That's it! Be sure to check back here regularly to see what new job search sites have been added. Also, search all the sites on a regular basis. New jobs are added daily so search often. 
 Warning:  Just like the scams and biz ops posing as jobs that you find in the newspaper classifieds, so too will you find them on job search sites. WAHS recommends ignoring any job announcement asking for money. They are most often scams or business opportunities. And, there are too many legitimate jobs to be wasting your money. For information on protecting yourself from scams visit the  Avoid Scams  page and check out recent  scams alerts .

 What about low income people? 
 People on SSI or SSDI.

 1. LTruex says __11 years ago
 
 I'm not sure about your question. There are options for people who are low income or on SSI. If you want to continue to receive your benefits though you need to abide by the policies set forth for receiving them which can limit how much you can make from home.

 Hi Pamela, There is lots of great opportunities. I post jobs here weekdays and a list of them in my newsletter on Fridays. But you have to understand you're not just going to sign up for a job. Work-at-home jobs are like traditional jobs: they have the same titles, require the sames types of skills and experience, and need a quality resume to impress the employer. So you need to start with your skills and experiences and look for jobs that need what you have to offer. You can also check out Jobs Online Toolkit ( http://www.jobsonlinetoolkit.com ) which offers over 300 companies that are frequently hiring for things like customer service, transcription, virtual assistance, etc.

 Thank you for the update on searching for legitimate jobs online. I check them out daily and so far, I have not found any that I might be interested in. I am continuing to look though. Again, thank you so much for the update. I will keep an eye out for future jobs online. 
 P.S. Your sites has always been very informative.

 I don't see much work for fashion design except for writers or bloggers. You can check writing sites such as writersweekly.com or Problogger.com for these jobs. The only sewing jobs I've seen are in Canada. If there is a Craigslist city near you, you might want to try a search there. But be careful as assembly jobs are usually scams. Remember to never pay money to get hired.

 Yes, free job sites are free for job searchers to use. If you have other sites to share, I'd love to see them. I have detailed lists in my free Job Online Report and in the Jobs Online Toolkit. But that doesn't mean I know them all!! Thanks!

 Thanks for the listing those resources for avoiding scams. Are there particular kinds of work-at-home jobs you've found are likely to be scams? 
Cheers. 
 __Reply 
 1. [LTruex](http://www.workathomesuccess.com) says __10 years ago
 
 Hi Grant, Most "Processing" jobs such as email processing, rebate processing, etc will scams. So will "typing" and most "data entry". Assembly work and envelope stuffing are two common scams. Avoid any job that asks you to use your personal bank account to help it do business. Thanks for posting.

 Hi Brenda, If you mean do I know any sites where you can sign up for work, the answer is no. Companies with work-at-home jobs require the same process as traditional jobs. You need to start with your skills and experience and look for job openings that need them. If you mean do I know companies that legitimate jobs or resources with legitimate jobs, the answer is yes. I post work-at-home jobs every weekday and in my newsletter. Plus I include resources for finding jobs.  http://www.workathomesuccess.com/category/work-at-home-jobs/

 The thing with work at home jobs there are a lot of scammers out there. Rule number one never pay for information for work at home or pay for a package to work at home. 
 __Reply 
 1. [LTruex](http://www.workathomesuccess.com) says __7 years ago
 
 You're right Craig, there are a lot of scammers. And one should never pay money to get hired to a work-at-home job. A home business might require an investment, just like starting a traditional business would. But one should always do their research before investing any money. The old adage that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. I've met many people who work at home and none of them are involved in the easy money methods scammers promote because they don't work. Thanks for posting.

 Hello Leslie, 
 I have been listening to your podcasts this year, as I would like to start my work from home business but there is a lot of information and I do not know where to start. 
I live in Canada and I work as a Administrative Assistant/ Bookkeeper. 
I would like your suggestions regards this matter. 
 Also, I would like to congratulate you for your web site. It is a huge resource for people like me. 
 Thanks, 
 Ana Sanchez

 Hi Ana - It is overwhelming to weed through all the work-at-home information. My recommendation is to learn about working at home, which are by reading material on this site and listening to the podcast. There are some great books out there as well. The next step is to inventory your skills, interests, passions etc to find a work-at-home idea you want to pursue. You could start a VA business that included bookkeeping. Or you can find VA/Bookkeeping job (I think a business would pay more). Or maybe you don't like that kind of work, in which you can tap into a different skill you have. The next step is putting things in place whether it's making a business plan or writing a resume. Then it's implementation time where you find clients or an employer. Good luck.
