 Hi, all 
 Ricky had a satisfying career as a bandleader. 
 Ricky was satisfited with his career as a bandleader. 
 I just came across the two sentences from other websites, where the writer says these two sentences have the same meaning. To my ear, it seems to be totally different, but I can't tell the distinction between them precisely. Am I right that these two sentences are not the same in meaning? 
 Thanks.

 The approach is different but the sentences are essentially the same: 
 _Ricky had a satisfying career as a bandleader = the career satisfied him. 
Ricky was satisfied with his career as a bandleader = he was satisfied with his career.
