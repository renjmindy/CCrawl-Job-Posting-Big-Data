 Congratulations to Latryce Pearse winner of our NAIDOC artwork competition 
 BY: Tracey Mesken10/11/2020 
 ​Latryce Pearse a WorkPac Machine Operator at Rio Tinto Gove is the winner of the WorkPac’s inaugural National NAIDOC artwork competition. Her artwork ‘Arnhem Resilience’', illustrates how European contact challenged Indigenous people and tried to divide our communities.​The competition was a chance for talented Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artists who are employed by the WorkPac Group to be recognised across Australia. ​JobTrail General Manager Julian Genn explained, “To help WorkPac & JobTrail celebrate NAIDOC week we invited our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees to submit artworks for the inaugural 2020 WorkPac National NAIDOC Artwork Competition.”​“The winning artist receives a $500 prize and the artwork has been used to create our 2020 WorkPac NAIDOC week shirt which will be worn by WorkPac staff across Australia.” ​“We are thrilled to congratulate our competition winner Latryce Pearse, a Machine Operator at Rio Tinto’s Gove Operations, said Mr Genn.​Latryce’s father is Yolngu from Nhulunbuy and her mother is Tahitian (French Polynesian). The local language in Nhulunbuy in Yolngu Matha. ​Ms Pearce explains “My favourite part of NAIDOC is that it gives Indigenous people the opportunity to showcase their talent from all around the country.” ​“I decided I wanted each piece of artwork to represent both sides of my Aboriginal & Polynesian heritage. ​“So I started to incorporate bright colours and traditional Indigenous symbols and patterns.​“I also love to use the acrylic pour method in some of my pieces to usually symbolise flowing rivers. ​“I get a lot of my inspiration from other Indigenous artists around Australia.”​Ms Pearce’s NAIDOC art represents how European contact challenged Indigenous people and tried to divide our communities. It shows that mother earth provided the rivers and medicine leaves to the people to provide healing and protection. Indigenous people have held it's strong culture, spirit and connection to the land and seas. "Always was Always will be" the healer and protector of the people.​Born in Nhulunbuy, Ms Pearce has also lived in Brisbane for 10 years, and Darwin for 3 years. ​“I came back home to Gove because it’s one of the best places in Australia in my opinion! ​‘I love the easy going lifestyle, I love fishing and camping, exploring the crystal clear beaches and islands. ​‘And I have a lot of family here from both sides, so I’m very lucky. ​Ms Pearce started working for WorkPac as a Machine Operator in July 2020.​She said “I love that [this job is] a new industry to what my previous roles have typically been (Admin / Accounts based) and that I’m learning a new skill!”​“I also love my roster, 4 days on 4 days off.”​NAIDOC events will be held virtually by WorkPac this year. The company will hold a national online event with guest speakers and performers.​The 2020 NADIOC theme: Always Was, Always Will Be. recognises that First Nations people have occupied and cared for this continent for over 65,000 years.​Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were Australia’s first explorers, first navigators, first engineers, first farmers, first botanists, first scientists, first diplomats, first astronomers and first artists.​NAIDOC 2020 invites all Australians to embrace the true history of this country – a history which dates back thousands of generations.It’s about seeing, hearing, and learning the First Nations’ 65,000+ year history of this country - which is Australian history. We want all Australians to celebrate that we have the oldest continuing cultures on the planet and to recognise that our sovereignty was never ceded.​Learn more about NAIDOC https://www.naidoc.org.au/get-involved/2020-theme​​

 BY: Tracey Mesken05/08/2019 
 ​WorkPac and JobTrail have proudly continued our relationship with MADALAH by returning as sponsors of the annual MADALAH Ball, held in Perth over the weekend.Focused on supporting Indigenous youth through education, the organisation offers secondary, transition and tertiary education scholarships at leading schools and universities for students from remote and regional communities in Western Australia.Established in 2016, the MADALAH Ball is an annual event that helps the organisation raise funds to grow their services. Since being founded the event has been able to fund 49 additional scholarships for students in WA, which will be used to give kids the best start possible through invaluable education opportunities.WorkPac’s relationship with the organisation began last year, and since then our Indigenous employment division JobTrail have been fortunate enough to work closely with them. National Manager for JobTrail, Julian Genn, is proud that the team has been able to forge partnerships like this that are making a difference.“Having this relationship gives us the opportunity to engage with the students, which means we can directly see the impact of our funding”.“Both JobTrail and WorkPac feel that supporting education is vital, particularly as it offers opportunities to upskill youth to help them find employment locally, which keeps regional and rural Australia thriving”“JobTrail in WA is working on some other exciting joint ventures with MADALAH in Broome, and we look forward to continuing our relationship and returning as sponsors for the ball in 2020”.If you want to learn more about MADALAH and the great work that they’re doing in WA, you can visit their website here

 WorkPac donates $20,000 and car to youth program in Blackwater 
 BY: Tracey Mesken07/02/2017 
 ​WorkPac and its indigenous division JobTrail, is partnering with Wesfarmers to sponsor the Police Citizens Youth Club’s Braking the Cycle program in Blackwater.The launch of the program was held at the Blackwater PCYC yesterday in the Central Highlands Region of Queensland.The program provides disadvantaged youth with the opportunity to obtain their driving licence through the support of a volunteer mentor network and access to a vehicle.Members of the police force and local council attended the launch with representatives from WorkPac, Wesfarmers Curragh and the Queensland Department of Transport.Sergeant Dominic Richardson, PCYC Branch Manager, spoke about the importance of holding a drivers licence, explaining that it was a core life and work skill in a community where there is no public transport.A drivers licence is a standard employment requirement and without access to a car and family support, it can become a barrier too large to overcome.WorkPac donated the vehicle and $20,000 to help fund expenses such as fuel and servicing.Giving the community access to a vehicle and providing a supportive network of mentors who can assist with the required 100 log hours helps young people break the cycle of disadvantage.​Pictured left to right: Julian Genn, JobTrail; Liz Blythe, Wesfarmers Curragh; Sgt Dominic Richardson, PCYC Blackwater; Rachel Schurmann, PCYC Blackwater.​Pictured: The first participants in the Braking the Cycle program.
