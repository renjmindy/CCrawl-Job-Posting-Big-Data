 Senior FP&A Analyst - Cambridge - £50 - £60k + Bonus 
 Do you have a passion for analysis and possess the ability to present critical MI to the leadership team? 
 Gleeson Recruitment is working with a rapidly growing organisation In Cambridge to recruit a driven Senior FP&A Analyst. The role will need a Qualified Accountant (ACA, ACCA or CIMA) who can take ownership of functional cost reporting, providing monthly updates to the leadership team and possess the confidence and communication skills to not only provide insight, but also identify areas for development, and make suggestions on improvements. A few of the other responsibilities will include budgeting and forecasting, financial modelling, supporting the creation of the 5-year plan, KPI reporting, and detailed analysis. 
 The business is growing rapidly which will provide an excellent opportunity for an ambitious accountant to develop their career within an organisation that will likely double in size in the next 12 months and become one of the largest technology businesses in the UK. Due to the fast paced nature of the business, it is essential that anybody joining is adaptable and resilient, as there will be plenty of opportunities to add more value, and provide a platform for future progression, however, it will be hard work and will need long hours when required. 
 The Finance team has doubled in size over the past 12 months and with further additions in the pipeline, there will be plenty of opportunities for high performers to progress. 
 The right person for the Senior FP&A Analyst role needs to be Qualified ACA, ACCA or CIMA with experience gained within a practice or analytical experience gained in industry in a fast-paced environment. Financial modelling experience would also be an advantage.
