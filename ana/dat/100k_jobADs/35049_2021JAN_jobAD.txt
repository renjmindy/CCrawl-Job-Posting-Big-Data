 Role overview 
 Role overview 
 ‚ÄúBlockchains do not scale to a global user-base of seven billion people.‚Äù 
 Rust engineering at  Metastate  focuses on building, extending, and maintaining decentralized, permissionless, and censorship-resistant protocols. We are looking for experienced Rust developers that are interested in applying novel research to create high-quality open-source technology and solve outstanding problems in the blockchain space. 
 As a member of the core protocol engineering team, you will be working on distributed ledger technology implemented in Rust, all the way up and down the stack from the P2P layer to consensus algorithms, smart contract systems, proof-of-stake incentive mechanisms, privacy-enhancing cryptographic components, and on-chain governance procedures. 
 This role offers the chance to work closely on compelling cross-disciplinary problems in computer science, systems engineering, cryptography, and economics, and enjoy a high degree of independence in working conditions and prioritization. 
 Responsibilities 
 
 Produce technical specifications of distributed ledger protocols or protocol upgrades in coordination with other team members 
 Evaluate algorithmic complexity, incentive compatibility, and implementation difficulty of possible new protocols 
 Implement protocols in performant and cleanly abstracted Rust code 
 Comprehensively document and test protocols and protocol changes 
 Benchmark implementations and adjust both high-level architecture and low-level details in order to optimise for performance while retaining semantic correctness 
 Conduct code reviews in coordination with other team members and help maintain a high standard of quality across the codebase 
 
 Qualifications 
 
 Prior experience with systems programming in Rust 
 Deep familiarity with Rust abstractions, memory management, and concurrency 
 Self-motivated & self-organized 
 Interested in open-source technology and research applied to DLT 
 
 Bonus Qualifications 
 
 Prior experience with large scale distributed systems 
 Prior experience with network and systems engineering 
 Prior experience with database design and optimization 
 Prior experience in blockchain technology 
 Prior experience implementing cryptography 
 
 Misc. 
 Competitive compensation in a negotiable mix of salary and equity. 
 Remote or local (Z√ºrich/Zug, Berlin). When remote, preferred if mostly located within (+/- 7 hours) Central European time zones. Ideally someone who enjoys nature and hiking üèîÔ∏è.

 Metastate is a research and engineering team focused on implementing cutting-edge research from numerous disciplines (distributed systems, PLT, zero-knowledge cryptography) and deploying them to solve hard problems in the blockchain space, such as scalability, secure smart contract languages, secure randomness or privacy. Metastate is a remote-first team, currently composed of 15 cross-disciplinary researchers and engineers located around the world. Our work culture is characterized by open-allocation, where team members have a high degree of freedom and autonomy in choosing when to work, what to work on, and whom to work with. Metastate was founded in early 2019 by @adrian_brink, @awasunyin and @cwgoes, with extensive experience in the blockchain space and who previously co-founded Cryptium Labs, a security-oriented proof-of-stake validator from the Swiss Alps.
