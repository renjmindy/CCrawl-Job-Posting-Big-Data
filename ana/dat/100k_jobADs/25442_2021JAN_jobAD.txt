 What Did You Want To Be When You Grow Up 
 This is a question we were all asked at one point or another in our childhood. Was it a doctor? Or an engineer? Perhaps a teacher? My answers varied depending on how old I was when I was asked the same thing. 
 I first wanted to be a dinosaur -- a T-Rex or a triceratops. T-Rex because I really thought they're amazing and huge creatures, like kings and queens of dinosaur land. I like triceratops, too, because they look really cute in my eyes then. As I grew up, I learned I can't be a dinosaur but my love for them still grew. The T-Rex became who I want to be, strong and smart! And the triceratops? I really find them sexy when they walk. Haha! 
 Then a mutant. And I was so damn serious I wanted to be one. I've always wanted to be Magneto's female version! ðŸ˜‰ Funny how as a child, we know what we wanted to be when we grow up, right? 
 I first attended school when I was three and a half years old. It was then that I wanted something I thought better than just being a dinosaur or a mutant. I wanted to be a nun. True story! Haha! Mainly because my teachers were nuns. But that changed soon enough when I realized I wanted to be a singer! Oh man, I love to sing! I still want to be a singer these days but I guess, singing in a karaoke bar or at home is as far as that dream could get. ðŸ˜‰ 
 Come elementary years, I wanted to be an archaeologist and a librarian. This is mainly because of my love for reading. The books we had at home back then were volumes of encyclopedias and history books which my father enjoyed reading, not novels and stuff so I was very much interested in ancient past and material remains back then. 
 High school and college years were different. I wanted to be a lawyer then. And I wanted to be in the world of politics. I don't remember quite well anymore what made me wanted this at that time but just like becoming a singer, it's a dream I still have until now. 
 None of what I wanted to be when I was younger came true. I lead a totally different life now. A life far from what I imagined as a child. My interests changed and adjusted over the years. Being exposed to different environments or hobbies or new experiences molded me into who I became now. It's good to know that I continue to evolve as I open up to change and new things. Lately though, I have this strong desire to become a dinosaur or a mutant again instead. And I'm seriousâ€¦ 
 So my dear readers, I want to know what it was you wanted to be when you grew up? Did it come true? Did it actually become your career now? Or a hobby? Or did it remain to be just an interest? I'd be really glad to know so feel free to write them in the comments. 
 Have a wonderful day, homo sapiens! ðŸ™‚
