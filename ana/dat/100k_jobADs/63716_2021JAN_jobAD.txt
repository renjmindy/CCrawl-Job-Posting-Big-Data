 Background: 
 Like many businesses, The Fitting Room has gone through a transition of change in 2020. From being an agency known for storytelling through activations, parties and experiential marketing, we have stepped into a new era. Our thinking and commitment to understanding people, audiences and culture has remained the same but the channels that we use to deliver those messages are sometimes a bit different. We have taken the time to revaluate our agency and make some changes and we are now looking for a Senior Account Manager to join the team. 
 The Fitting Room started in 2013 by our founder who had £17.22 in the bank when she started and it has been a ride. We are very much an independent agency which has its pros and its cons but the people within the business have always cared deeply about what they deliver and about the business. 
 We have had a rollercoaster ride from seventeen pounds but we now want to make sure we evolve into the agency we envisioned with all the learnings and the highs we've had over the last 7 years. 
 The role: 
 This is an exciting role for us to recruit for. Our Founder and Managing Director is looking for her right-hand. This person will be all over everything, clients and new business. You will be working alongside our Founder as she drives The Fitting Room forwards and this requires all the disciplines to deliver a Junior Account Director role but in addition needs certain attributes: 
 - Obsessive attention to detail 
 - A love for working with people to deliver excellent results 
 - Someone really, really, smart 
 - A real hunger to win 
 - A proactive and reactive thinker 
 - Desire to be a part of a vision that is punchy and therefore will bring wins and losses 
 - A person who can bring energy to a room 
 - A multi-tasker 
 You will work alongside our Managing Director and Creative Lead to make sure our clients receive impeccable service and that the work is not only excellent but exceeds expectation. You should not be afraid to challenge, educate and inspire those around you. 
 Deliverables: 
 - Maintaining and growing relationships with our existing client base 
 - Working closely on our growth strategy to make sure we are delivering against our annual objectives 
 - Managing client status meetings and performance reporting 
 - Make sure all projects and campaigns are delivered on time and within budget 
 - Working closely with our Creative Lead to make sure we are delivering against the client objectives and deliverables 
 - Confidence to run meetings and the ability to be reactive to changing scenarios 
 - Analytical and numerical skills 
 - Excellent organisational skills 
 - Commercial awareness 
 - Excellent written and verbal communication 
 You must: 
 - Have a strong understanding of the FMCG and hospitality industries 
 - Have at least 6 yeas experience in account management 
 - Experience delivering multi-channel campaigns 
 - Immerse yourself in the businesses of the clients 
 - Be able to apply both commercial and creative thinking to everything the agency produces 
 - Have confidence to prepare proposals and present pitches that convert new business leads 
 - Conduct regular client and agency strategy meetings 
 - Delegate and provide constructive feedback to colleagues 
 The Package: 
 - Salary up to 55k per annum 
 - Flexible and remote working 
 - Time Out budget (Up to £360.00 per year) 
 - Work from home budget (£360.00 per year) 
 - Quarterly coaching sessions with an external coach 
 - Company away days and social events (we have been to Dublin, Amsterdam, New York, and Ibiza) (In 2019 our Christmas party with clients and suppliers was a roller disco with DJ Luck and MC Neat performing live)
