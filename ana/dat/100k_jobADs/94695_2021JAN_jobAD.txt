  Is Getting Your 'Dream Job' Just Luck?  
 Work It Daily 
 August 31, 2009 
 Dear Experts, I've don't EVERYTHING they've told me to do. I've networked, gotten mentors, volunteered, started a blog, blah blah blah! And yet, I still don't have a job. I'm so angry about it, I want to scream. I'm working a horrible job just to pay my student loans and I'm sick of hearing stories about people getting their 'dream job' because I think it's just dumb luck if they do. The rest of us are doing all the right things too and still not getting hired. What advice can you give that will actually make a difference?  Here is how our T.A.P. experts answered this question:   Q#271  How about actually giving some info so we can help? Sounds like you're a teensy bit on the whiny side. ( @beneubanks )  Q#271  You won't want to hear this, but you are doing it right. Just keep it up and avoid getting frustrated and desperate. ( @gradversity )  Q#271  (Part 1) This may sound counterintuitive, but I recommend taking focus 'off' getting dream job for a bit. ( @ValueIntoWords )  Q#271  (Part 2) Is akin to 'watched pot never boils' - Keep 'burner on;' let things simmer a bit. It will come, in time. ( @ValueIntoWords )  Q#271  What appears to be "dumb luck" on the outside is usually the result of patient, methodical positioning. ( @dawnbugni )  Q#271  Reminds me of "overnight sensations" playing dive clubs for 15 yrs B4 making it big. (BTW: Anger projects) ( @dawnbugni )  Q#271  Dream jobs rarely come by luck but through consistant application and effort, ok 2b frustrated but don't give up. ( @kgrantcareers )  Q#271  Luck is where preparation meets opportunity. Check attitude/expectations and re-review materials. ( @keppie_careers )  Q#271  Pasteur: "Chance favors the prepared mind." Takes time, commitment, thru frustration 2 reach ur dream. ( @juliaerickson )  Q#271  More: gd 2 vent a bit; also b even more specific abt ur goal; view/use current job as step 2 dream. ( @juliaerickson )  Our Twitter Advice Project (T.A.P.) is no longer an active campaign.
