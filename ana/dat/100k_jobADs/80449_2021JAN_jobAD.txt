 Join an innovative internal start-up disrupting the insurance space with technology 
 Role overview 
 One of the world's fastest growing quantitative hedge funds embarks on a venture to transform the insurance industry. Leaders in their fields across Software Engineering and Mathematics, they harness the power of data science and advanced technology to fuel their success. 
 Role 
 Technology drives our business â€” it's our main competitive advantage â€” and as a result, software engineers play a pivotal role. They tackle the hardest problems through analysis, experimentation, design, and elegant implementation. 
 A very new and exciting partnership within the commercial insurance industry has opened the opportunity to apply a rigorous scientific method, utlising advanced technology and data science, to an out dated multi-billion dollar industry. This internal start-up within Two Sigma is heavily backed and offers the chance for software engineers to build something truly innovative and industry transforming. 
 Problems at our level of complexity require you to possess a passion for learning as well as deep understanding across a wide array of technical competencies. Weâ€™ve attracted technologists who possess special capabilities in a wide variety of domains including data transformation and visualization, performance optimization, cloud computing, and distributed systems. While we face large-scale problems, we hire only the best to take them on. This enables us to keep your team size small and your individual impact significant. 
 While there is no set recipe for success at Two Sigma, we find that you will tend to have the following qualifications: 
 
 You have at least a bachelorâ€™s degree in a technical or quantitative field. 
 You have an understanding of data structures and algorithms. 
 You have experience with Java/Java 8 (or other JVM or functional languages), Python, C or C++. 
 You have extraordinary programming skills. 
 You have demonstrated experience in large-scale, cloud deployed systems.

 More than 1,700 people who believe the scientific method is the best way to approach investing. Ideas backed up with information. And improved by iteration. Thatâ€™s Two Sigma. Weâ€™re not your typical investment manager. We follow principles of technology and innovation as much as principles of investment management. Fields like machine learning and distributed computing guide us. Since 2001, weâ€™ve searched for ways that these kinds of technologies can make us better at what we do. We never stop researching and developing. In the process, we work to help real people. Through our investors, we support the retirements of millions around the world. And we help fund breakthrough research, education and a wide range of charities and foundations.
