 What Makes a Company Attractive to Job Seekers? 
 by  admin  | Sep 26, 2019 |  Careers ,  Leadership ,  Staffing Firm 
 Each year, a report of the  best companies in America  to work for is released. The list is compiled by conducting a survey of millions of employees across the nation to ask them about their work experience and what makes their job attractive to them. It can be easy to dismiss these lists, as many readers may view them as irrelevant. After all, most business owners aren’t running multi-million dollar companies. However, what’s interesting about this list is that the size of the company and the salary aren’t in the employees’ reasons for staying with their companies; it’s about the culture. Here are some tips for crafting an engaging office culture in your company. 
 Benefits 
 One of the first things job seekers look at is the benefits. Studies show that the benefits offered by a company are more important to prospective employees than the actual pay. While the paycheck is an important consideration, the focus today is on how working for your company will benefit their livelihood outside of the workplace. If the benefits are valuable, job seekers are more likely to apply for a job, even if the pay is lower than what they would like. If you don’t already, you may look into offering benefits such as bonuses, flex time, vacation, and mental health days. Another key incentive is a benefits package that starts immediately or shortly after an employee is hired. 
 Culture and Community 
 The culture piece is a major one that should never be overlooked. Take a moment to walk through your office and view everything through the eyes of a stranger. Does your office look warm and inviting? How is the energy of your employees? Does it look like a place you’d want to work? If the answer is no, determine what can be changed. Ask your employees what would make them happier. Be intentional and take your time; office culture doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a process that requires open and honest communication between yourself and your staff. From the  top 100 list  mentioned earlier, here are some of the common themes: 
 
 Genuine care and concern from employers for their employees and customers. 
 Companies that care about and give back to their community. 
 Environments that encourage employees to follow their passions and build a career. 
 Companies that adhere to and exemplify their core values. 
 
 Feedback from Past and Current Employees 
 You can write the perfectly crafted job posting or company description, but anyone can write an enticing tag-line. Unless you have the endorsement of others to back up your words, it won’t make much of a difference to job seekers. Just like you would attract potential clients by advertising client reviews of your services, you need to do the same for your job seekers. Let them hear directly from your employees, both past and current, and see first-hand that your culture is alive and thriving. 
 Attract the Right People 
 You don’t have to be a millionaire to enhance your workplace culture. It simply requires you to take the time to make intentional and meaningful changes in your company. Not only will your current staff appreciate the changes you make, but new employees will be impressed with your efforts as well.
