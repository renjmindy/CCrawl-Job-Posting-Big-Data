 I'm interested to work as Senior Carer in UK. I'm a Physical Therapist, underboard. I have worked in a private PT Clinic in Olongapo for 2 yrs.They offer clinical service, hospital service and homecare service for Physical Therapy. The center is owned by a licensed Physiatrist and Head of the Rehabilitation Medicine in one of the hospitals in Olongapo City. We handled different cases of patients like stroke,CP,Bells Palsy,Fracture, Low Back Pain, Myofascial Pain syndrome, Arthritis, Parkinsons & nerve affectations. 
After working for 2 yrs. in this center,I decided to work as Freelance Physical Therapist from year 2002 to 2009. Most of my patients are homecare service, referred by licensed PT's and Doctors. 
I am interested in your ads. I'm still single, strong and energetic. I hope you would consider my application. I am 48 years old, staying with my sister and mother here in Makati City. 
Thank you and looking forward to hear from you soon. God bless and more power!
