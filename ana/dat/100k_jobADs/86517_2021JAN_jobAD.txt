 Experience working with C# and .NET technologies 
 WebAPI (1 & 2) and Entity Framework 
 Experience with Javascript frameworks such as Angular, Vue or React (Redux).

 An interest in learning new languages and platforms. 
 Team ethic. You make change happen by working with & through others. 
 ‚ÄúCan do‚Äù attitude - when faced with a business or technical obstacle you will not run and hide. You should be able to describe the issues you‚Äôve encountered, your approach to solving them and your final solution. 
 Finance/FinTech experience is beneficial, but not necessary.
