 Prefer my life-disciplines over chasing after money, 
 and God-knowledge over a lucrative career. 
For Wisdom is better than all the trappings of wealth; 
nothing you could wish for holds a candle to her." ~King Solomon 
 
 Source:  Proverbs 8:10-11  (The Message) 
 There is a lot of confusion among followers of Jesus about money, wealth, poverty, riches and what God wants for us. This isn't intended to be an indictment about prosperity ministries but it is intended to offer caution both from King Solomon and most importantly, Jesus. 
 What is most important?  King Solomon makes it clear that wisdom is more important than money. This from a man who was one of the wealthiest of his time. King Solomon suggest spending our time focused on wisdom and not so much on money, careers and wealth. 
 Why are wisdom, God-knowledge and life-discipline so important?  Our heart and character are more important than our bank account. What is my soul worth? Is wealth here and now more important than eternal life with Jesus? In Proverbs 19 we learn  " Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity than he who is perverse in speech and is a fool."  Our integrity is essential. 
 Is King Solomon off base? What does Jesus say?  In the Jesus Manifesto (Matthew 5 - 7), Jesus tells me _“  Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth  , where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But  store up for yourselves treasures in heaven  , where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal; ****__ for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also ."_ Jesus is all about the Kingdom of God and heaven. Jesus challenges me to focus on His Kingdom and not wealth here. 
 Here is some more from Jesus. This is just some from Luke! 
 What is the point of all this? Jesus has a lot to say. This is just some of it from Luke. I think Jesus is clear but you can decide for yourself. 
 He has brought down the powerful from their thrones, and lifted up the lowly; he has  filled the hungry with good things  , and  sent the rich away empty . — Luke 1:52-53 
 When he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, he went to the synagogue on the sabbath day, as was his custom. He stood up to read, and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because  he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor . He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.” And he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. Then he began to say to them, “  Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing .” —Luke 4:16-21 
 Then he looked up at his disciples and said: “  Blessed are you who are poor  , for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you will be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.” — Luke 6:20-21 
 “But  woe to you who are rich  , for you have received your consolation. Woe to you who are full now, for you will be hungry. Woe to you who are laughing now, for you will mourn and weep.” — Luke 6:24-25 
 “As for those who fell among the thorns, these are the ones who hear; but as they go on their way, they are  choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life  , and their fruit does not mature.” — Luke 8:14 
 “What does it profit them if they gain the whole world  , but lose or forfeit themselves?” — Luke 9:25 
 The Pharisee was amazed to see that he did not first wash before dinner. Then the Lord said to him, “Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside you are full of  greed and wickedness . You fools! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also? So  give for alms those things that are within  ; and see everything will be clean for you.” — Luke 11:38-41 
 “But woe to you Pharisees! For  you tithe mint and rue and herbs of all kinds  , and  neglect justice and the love of God  ; it is these you ought to have practiced, without neglecting the others.” — Luke 11:42 
 Someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the family inheritance with me.” But he said to him, “Friend, who set me to be a judge or arbitrator over you?” And he said to them, “Take care!  Be on your guard against all kinds of greed  ; for  one’s life does not consist in the abundance of possessions .” — Luke 12:13-15 
 Then he told them a parable: “The  land of a rich man  produced abundantly. And he thought to himself, ‘What should I do, for I have no place to store my crops?’ Then he said, ‘I will do this: I will pull down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store  all my grain and my goods . And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have  ample goods  laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.’ But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night you life is being demanded of you. And  the things you have prepared, whose will they be?  ’ So it is with those who store up  treasures for themselves   but are not rich toward God .” — Luke 12:16-21 
 He said to his disciples, “  Therefore I tell you, do not worry  about your life, what you will eat, or about your body, what you will wear. For  life is more than food and the body more than clothing . … But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you—you of little faith! And  do not keep striving for what you are to eat and what you are to drink, and do not keep worrying. For it is the nations of the world that strive after all these things, and your Father knows that you need them . Instead,strive for his kingdom, and  these things will be given to you as well . Do not be afraid, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to  give you  the kingdom.” — Luke 11:22-32 
 “  Sell your possessions, and give alms . Make purses for yourselves that do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. For  where your treasure is, there you heart will be also .” —Luke 12:33-34 
 From everyone to whom much has been given, much will be required; and from the one to whom much has been entrusted, even more will be demanded .” — Luke 12:42-48 
 He also said to the one who had invited him, “When you give a luncheon or a dinner,  do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors  , in case they may invite you in return, and you would be repaid. But  when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind . And you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you, for  you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous .” — Luke 14:12-14 
 “For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not first sit down and  estimate the cost  , to see whether he has enough to complete it? Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it will begin to ridicule him, saying, ‘This fellow began to build and was not able to finish.’ Or what king, going out to wage ware against another king, will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one who comes against him with twenty thousand? If he cannot, then, while the other is still far away, he sends a delegation and asks for the terms of peace.  So therefore, none of you can become my disciple if you do not give up all your possessions .” — Luke 14:28-33 
 “Whoever is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much; and whoever is dishonest in a very little is dishonest also in much.  If then you have not been faithful with the dishonest wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches?  And if you have not been faithful with what belongs to another, who will give you what is your own? No slave can serve two masters; for a slave  will either hate the one and love the other, or be devoted to the one and despise the other .  You cannot serve God and wealth .” — Luke 16:10-13 
 The Pharisees,  who were lovers of money  , heard all this, and they ridiculed him. So he said to them, “You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of others; but God knows your hearts; for  what is prized by human beings is an abomination in the sight of God.”  — Luke 16:14-15 
 “There was a  rich man  who was dressed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day. And at his gate lay a  poor man  named Lazarus, covered with sores, who  longed to satisfy his hunger with what fell from the rich man’s table  ; even the dogs would come and lick his sores.  The poor man died  and was carried away by the angels to be with Abraham.  The rich man also died  and was buried. In Hades, where he was being tormented, he looked up and saw Abraham far away with Lazarus by his side. He called out, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in agony in these flames.’ But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember that  during your lifetime you received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in agony .” — Luke 16:19-25 
 He entered Jericho and was passing through it. A man was there named Zacchaeus;  he was a chief tax collector and was rich . He was trying to see who Jesus was, but on account of the crowd he could not, because he was short in stature. So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see him, because he was going to pass that way. When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, hurry and come down; for I must stay at your house today.” So he hurried down and was happy to welcome him. All who saw it began to grumble and said, “He has gone to be the guest of one who is a sinner.”  Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord, “Look, half of my possessions, Lord, I will give to the poor; and if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I will pay back four times as much.  ” Then Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham. For the Son of Man came to seek out and to save the lost.” — Luke 19:1-10 
 Then he entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling things there; and he said, “It is written,  ‘My house shall be a house of prayer’; but you have made it a den of robbers.”  — Luke 19:45-46 
 He looked up and saw rich people putting their gifts into the treasury; he also saw a poor widow put in  two small copper coins . He said, “  Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all of them; for all of them have contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty has put in all she had to live on.  ” — Luke 21:1-4 
 He said to them, “  When I sent you out without a purse, bag, or sandals, did you lack anything?”  They said, “No, not a thing.” — Luke 22:35-38 
 Is that enough?

 Love when you link Proverbs and Jesus Christ. 
 Trying to convince most people to part with their money is like trying to pull out a half rotten molar in their mouth with your bare fingers, in my opinion.

 Yes, it is very difficult in our culture of wealth. I think challenging times are coming for many of us. I know I must prepare to live on less. It is all good though.

 Yeah, but it's so much easier say when we say it about others. Then we say things like, "Isn't that inspiring…? and such. " When it happens to us, we crawl up in prayer…"Woe is me…" And it more or less takes that in order for us to understand others.
