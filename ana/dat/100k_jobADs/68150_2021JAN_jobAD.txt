 News From Leslie  : 
 Digital Author Success  was just added to the Work-At-Home Success University course line up. You've been hearing about publishing on Kindle, Nook, etc, but maybe the process seems overwhelming. This four-week course takes you step-by-step through the entire process. When you're done (assuming your book is already written), you'll have a book published on Amazon (and others if you want) and can start generating sales. This course is for fiction and nonfiction writers. Visit  Work-At-Home Success University  to learn more about Digital Author Success and other WAHS U Courses.
