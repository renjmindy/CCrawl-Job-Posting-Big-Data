 What If Standard Career Advice Is Wrong? 
 Posted on  June 29, 2016June 26, 2016  by  Rachel Collis 
 Standard career advice says that if you want career success, then you need to decide where you want to be in your career in 10 years time and work out what you need to do in order to get there. 
 This advice may be outdated. I have written a post about it on  The Meaningful Success Project  Blog. You can read the full post  here .

 this is brilliant! thank you! I work in a VUCA environment in the UK and am in the middle of some major career changes, while the UK is in chaos around me. Really timely reminder to notice the good in the current role and commit to that while holding more lightly the longer term plans!

 I apparently was in a VUCA environment (world wide cost cutting) and was made redundant unexpectedly. then a new job didn't work out for me, so in my late 40s wondering where to next and how long it will be for. Great article, agree wholeheartedly. Look for something you think you will enjoy and know you can do!
