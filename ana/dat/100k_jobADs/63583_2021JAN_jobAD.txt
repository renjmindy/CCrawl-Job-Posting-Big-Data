 Last day of Hasbro: The Sequel 
 On  October 9, 2020October 13, 2020  By  pirategaspard In  Programming ,  Swashbuckling Leave a comment 
 
 I started as a temp at Hasbro back in 2006. When they moved my department to a Dedham office  in 2010 I left , only to return to Hasbro in 2011 once they moved my department back. At that time I thought I'd never leave Hasbro again. But things change. Today was my last day at Hasbro for the second time. I'm off to start a new adventure. Leaving Hasbro again was twice as hard as it was the first time I said goodbye. To all my Hasbro friends, I look forward to meeting up for a drink once Covid is over.

 It was a tough decision, but I've taken an position at another company. Today was my last day at Hasbro. I've loved working here and will certainly miss everyone.
