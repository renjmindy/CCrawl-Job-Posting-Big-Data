 Vinyasa in between jobs 
 As a freelance writer I am always working. While doing my first video I noticed that yoga was very effective for my writings. It clears my mind to be ready for writing my next piece. However, I must admit that doing yoga is not my routine. So it may be very useful, I still need to gain more motivation to add this to my writing routines.
