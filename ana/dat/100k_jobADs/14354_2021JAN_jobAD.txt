 The 10 Best Job Boards to Find Freelance Writing Jobs 
 TOPICS: companies hiring freelance writers how to get a paid blogging job job board online writing gigs paid blogging jobs places to find freelance writing jobs telecommute freelance writing jobs use social media to find jobs where to find freelance writing jobs 
 Posted By:  Guest Poster  July 1, 2013 
 My previous post on where to find freelance writing jobs is one of the most popular ones on the site.  But it needed an update. So here it is! 
 Updated: December 10, 2014 
 Where do you look for freelance writing jobs? 
 My favorite way to get freelance jobs is by networking and contacting editors directly. But when I was a newbie, I skimmed the job ads. In fact, I just skim them now so I can get an idea of what's out there. While job ads aren't the best way to get freelance writing jobs (and I'll talk more about why this is in the next few weeks), it isn't a bad place to start when you're new, or when you've been out of touch for a long time (like when you've had a long time client and haven't applied for anything in a while.) 
 In no particular order, here are the best job boards I've found for finding freelance writing work: 
 
 Freelance Job Openings 
 Online Writing Jobs  - Mostly listings from Craigslist and other job boards 
 Problogger  - a great list of blogging and telecommute gigs 
 ** Blogging Pro  **- this one doesn't have jobs very often listed, but every once in a while they have something good 
 ** Whisper Jobs  **- one of my favorite job boards. Often lists things other job boards don't. 
 Dice   - lists mostly technical writer jobs 
 Journalism Jobs  - reporter and journalist work 
 Media Bistro  - terrific resource all-around for freelancers 
 All Indie Writers  - Great list that highlights jobs by amount of pay. 
 Indeed - Wonderful job searching site.

 Cherie, your list of freelance jobs works! I applied for one and ot it. Unofrtunately they changed the requirements for the job sometime after I applied, and I am no longer interested in doing it.

 We just launched a new site called ContentSpree, an online marketplace that connects writers with businesses seeking quality writing services. We are hoping to connect with writers as we feel that our site will provide a place for writers to search for jobs, promote their services, connect with businesses and most importantly make money. Please take a look and let me know your thoughts
