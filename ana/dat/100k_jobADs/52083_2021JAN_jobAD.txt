 Peoria residents do not have to suffer on-the-job injuries alone 
 On behalf of John Lesaganich, P.C., Attorney at Law  | Mar 15, 2019 |  Workers' Compensation Injuries 
 Some occupations in Illinois are inherently dangerous. For example, those who work in manufacturing often work with heavy machinery or machinery with rapidly moving parts that they could be caught in or struck by. Or, for example, firefighters put their health and safety at risk every day to save the lives of others. 
 However, even occupations that might seem safe can cause injuries. For example, nurses can injure their backs moving a patient. Or, restaurant workers could suffer a slip-and-fall accident or could suffer cumulative trauma from having to repeatedly use their arms, shoulders and hands. Even office workers could suffer repetitive stress injuries from having to type for many hours in a row, or they could injure themselves lifting something heavy or trying to reach something on a tall shelf. 
 It is important for Peoria residents who have been injured on the job to understand whether they have a claim for workers' compensation for injuries. Workers' compensation serves as a financial safety net people need to pay for the medical care and lost wages they incur when they are injured and cannot work for a while. However, obtaining such benefits is not always easy. There are certain forms that must be filed by certain timelines. If a worker files an incomplete application for benefits, his or her application could be denied, necessitating an appeal. This can be a stressful situation to a person who is already under a serious financial, emotional and physical strain. 
 Therefore, it is important to understand that help with workers' compensation claims is available. At our firm, we handle the details of the application process, so our clients can focus on recovery. Sometimes a claim can be settled, while other times a claim must go through the arbitration process to reach a satisfactory resolution. Our firm's webpage on  workers' compensation injuries  can be a good starting point for those who want to learn more about this topic.
