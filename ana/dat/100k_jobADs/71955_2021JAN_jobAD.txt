 Watch out managers, your jobs are on the line!

 Watch out managers, your jobs are on the line! 
 Robots are replacing managers, too . I had written a post a while back when McDonald's had decided to launch tens of thousands of self order kiosks in their restaurants to replace repetitive low wage work. Well, I had mentioned that what is next could be the repetitive work of managers. A good manager delegates work and who else can do the delegation better and more efficiently than a human? most likely an automated system if not a robot with AI. (Automation bonanza! truck drivers, taxi drivers, food service clerks, attorneys, real estate agents, managers, maybe clergy next? how about politicians? boy that would be awesome!)
