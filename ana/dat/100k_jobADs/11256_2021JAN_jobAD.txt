 Pete  talks with  Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski 
——————————————————————
 December 2011 (1:02:30) 
 How did you kind of get into this, into this field in the 1st place ? 
 Uh well, it was a coincidence, 'cause obviously I made discovery of new  chemicals  ,  peptides  which is in  blood  , and I noticed that  they were deficient in patients with cancer  , and there was a curiosity, why there was such deficiency, and I was interested what these  peptides  that I discovered, are doing in the body 
So the connection with  cancer  was quite obvious 
He,  healthy people have abundance of these chemicals in blood 
 Cancer patients have varied to none 
So could be that  cancer  is another deficiency disease 
So 
 So when you found this out 
 Yes. Mhmm ? 
 how did you feel ? 
I mean, did you not just want to shout from the rooftops, and could you believe that you'd actually discovered something ? 
 Not yet 
Of course I was  skeptical  , and I found something that was interesting, but obviously, it was just the very beginning and when I shared this news uh with some other guys, who are obviously much older than me, who, other guys who were professors, who ever, so (laugh) they began to laugh so much they almost died from laughing 
Ok ? 
That (laughing) 
Wow, this guy would like to kill  cancer 
Forget it 
Ok ? 
 That's just not going to happen 
 What are you doing ? 
Yes sir (laugh) 
 Well how did that affect you ? 
 Well it didn't affect me too much because I knew that uh the  science  uh requires uh some successes and uh setbacks and I felt, well I still would like to know, what these  peptides  can do, and I would like to know what they can do, not only regarding  cancer  but in various aspects of  body function 
For instance, the  activity of the heart  , the  activity of the  uh uh  G.I. tract 
Whatever 
Ok 
I needed to expand this knowledge 
Suddenly I found some like  119 new peptide fractions 
Nobody ever heard of them 
So I wanted to know 
What do they do ? 
And when I was in  Poland  I couldn't have really do any further  testing  , because I didn't have such possibility to require different group of people who would do the  testing  , and simply by working in the  biochemistry laboratory  I did not have such capacity, and obviously the budget for doing uh  research  was extremely small 
Besides, I was continuously harassed by the communists and they were sending me to, eh, the military, so I couldn't do much 
I still did whatever I could 
Then I came to  U.S. 
 Oh so you came to  U.S. 
What, what year was that  ? 
 It was  1970 
 I heard you came with not very much money in your pocket 
 Uh well it was better than where I came first to the  U.K.  , because when I came first to  U.K.  , I came practically with nothing, and uh, when I went to  British  uh  Medical Student Association  , they were going to give me 7 pounds for one month stay in U.K. (laughing) 
You were supposed to get this money in  Poland 
 Yeah 
 (laughing) Sorry about that 
So ultimately they decided to give me 7 pounds, and obviously at that time it was a lot of money, so with 7 pounds I was able to survive a month 
(laughing) Good luck (laughing) 
But in  U.S.  , I was allowed by the communist government to $15, which again, was equivalent probably to 7 pounds, whatever (laughing) 
 So you came here with $15 
 I smuggled another 10 
 Yeah 
 So the proper balance was like 
 So what 
So what did you do when you got here  ? 
 Well, ehhh, when I arrived I was uh, uh, uh, trying to get ahold of my relatives 
My uncle that lived in Bronx 
 Yeah 
 And uh I officially came to visit him and uh I was expecting him to see me at the airport, and surely enough he came to the airport but uh at the time he was an elderly man 
He was close to 80, and eh, he probably went to a different part of  Kennedy airport  , so he couldn't find me 
So I was stuck in the airport 
This was  Holiday 
This was 4th of uh  September  , which was a  Labor Day  , and so I couldn't get uh uh to his apartment 
So finally I spent most of this money for the cab, the taxi rides to his apartment 
Some, like $13 worth 
 You had $2 left 
 Ye, Yeah 
 Plus the $10 
 Sure 
Well, so then I stay uh I, I was obviously in the family's, I couldn't 
 Yeah 
 I, I don't need to worry about it 
So obviously I had a food and lodging, and uh, still I was trying to get hold of some of the people whom I knew were doing the  research  in the area, whi, which I was interested 
 Mhmm 
 which was  peptide research  , and uh trying to see if I can advance my  research 
And then I thought, well, if I go back to  Poland  , I didn't expect to stay 
And in the meantime uh my job at the  university  in  Poland  was terminated, and I wondered they needed my position for the woman who was the wife of the 3rd Secretary of the communist party 
Finally when I was terminated from my job, uh, there was no need for me to go back, because I would not be able to find job anywhere in  Poland  , because obviously everything was controlled by communist 
So that I decided to stay and to look for the possible, possibility for me to find a job in the  U.S. 
 And wha, what job did you find  ? 
 Um 
 So you were in  New York  ? 
 Yes, I was very active, of course since I was involved in the research 
I knew the key people who were involved in  peptide research 
There were not many of them, but at least there was one good team in  New York  and  Columbia 
Um, there was another one at, uh,  Cleveland Clinic  , and there was another one in  Houston  , and so, uh, I check with all of them and, uh, the place in  New York  was unavailable because they hired, um, somebody, um, about a week before I came 
Uh but uh, uh, I was invited to the interview to  Houston 
I was surprised but uh, prepared for my trip and I arrived to  Houston  and had interview with a professor at  Baylor College of Medicine  and he gave me the employment, and so it was relatively simple 
 And then what were you doing on like a day-to-day basis  ? 
 Uh, well, uh, when I arrived to  Houston  I uh, obviously received a job 
I received the job as  " Research Associate,"  and um, obviously this was associated with a reasonable salary, but the salary was paid once a month, so I had to think, what do I do for the 1st half of the month, because I came in the middle of the month, and didn't have any money (laughing: both), but some good people loaned me some money so I, I have enough money to rent the apartment, and finally after I got my pay, I was able to do quite well, and I was able to advance, uh, in  peptide research 
 So were you able to do your own research or 
 Absolutely. Absolutely 
 that they wanted you to do  ? 
 Absolutely, and uh, I was quite lucky to join the team of the famous professor 
 Professor George H 
er, uh, who was initially professor of  Sorbonne  in  Paris 
Then in  World War II  he emigrated to  U.K.  and he was professor at  Oxford  , and so finally he came to  U.S.  , and, uh, he put together the  peptide research  team 
He needed people who know how to do analysis of  peptides  , so that's why he hired me 
And uh I uh told him that I have my own project, which is  peptides  , and if you wouldn't mind that I do some research of mind, and he agreed 
So basically this was gentleman agreement that I will spend 50% of my time working for him, and spend 50% time, working in my area 
Uh, the equipment and the instruments were the same, so it wasn't too difficult 
 And then you, and then when you had something to show then, when. when you had even more of something to show them, how was that received, because you see, I've really got something here  ? 
 Ah 
 I think I've got something here 
 Absolutely, it was received with great curiosity, and, um, and obviously he needed people who could use, the cutting edge, uh, methods for  peptide  analysis, and that's what I knew about, but I couldn't use this for him because I didn't have funds to do it, but I knew exactly what needs to be done, and on the other hand, uh, this was great surrounding because just across the corridor, another team receive a  Nobel Prize  for working on  peptides 
The only problem is, uh, one of these researchers uh was of  Polish  origin who received  Nobel Prize  for  peptides  (laughing) 
 Yeah 
 began, uh, fighting with the other one and finally his job was terminated because he punched (laughing) 
 Punched him  ? 
 the other guy in the nose (laughing) 
 Yeah 
Huh 
 So, but the good thing about it is that ultimately I inherited uh, their equipment 
 Yeah 
 for  peptide research  , so 
 Wow. So that must have been like a, like, a, a child in a sweet shop 
 Absolutely, so was a great coincidence so 
 So then you were really able to, to, to, to look at it in more detail, and  ? 
 Absolutely, so then of course I was really out of work uh, and the team of  Dr. Unger  , and also, uh, I was spending a lot of time, uh, progressing in my research, which was very important uh, of course it means long hours uh, 'cause of, uh, 8 hours I would spending working for  Dr. Unger  and probably not 8 hours until midnight working on my uh, project, but uh, I enjoy it 
In the meantime I need to prepare for exams because I wanted to have a license 
So I was lucky because uh, within 3 months I was able to pass exams to uh, to naturalize my diploma, and then uh, just, uh, the day, on the eve of my birthday, on  January 22nd  ,  President Nixon  had a speech in which he promised  American  people that by  200th  anniversary of  America  , they would have a  cancer cure  , and no limits would be set on the funding 
So then I thought, well, if that's the case, perhaps I should apply for the grant also, and I did 
It was crazy idea because I could barely understand when the people were talking to me (laughing: both) 
Well I decided to put together grant application, in to the  National Cancer Institute  , and include the project on the  peptides  which I discovered, and I was surprised when this was approved 
So then in uh  1971  I get approved as  Principle Investigator  , to do the project, which included eh, the top people from  M.D. Anderson Cancer Center  , and from  Baylor College of Medicine  , um, and I was supervising this 
I was at that time 28 years old, but I was supervising the guys who were famous, and who were some like 60 years old (laughing) 
 Wow 
 and so the money was coming to me from the  National Cancer Institute  , and I was uh daily uh, running the project, sharing, obviously with the guys from  M.D. Anderson  , so, and going ahead with the research, so 
and of course at that time I was disappointed to have to (work ?) with  M.D. Anderson  and  Baylor  , and then I could move independently what I was doing 
 So at what point were you actually, able to start testing on people 
 Mmm 
It took a long time because 
 I mean you couldn't wait, right  ? 
 Yeah it took a long time because obviously um, initially you have to go through a lot of  pre-clinical testing 
The 1st time it was uh, around the beginning of  ' 77 , yeah 
So then we began  phase I clinical trials  , and this  phase I clinical trials  were approved by one of the very good hospitals in  Houston  , which is part of the hospital chain  American Medical International  , and they interviewed my project and their  Institutional Review Board  approved it for clinical trials 
Well then I did my 1st  clinical trials  ,  phase I clinical trial  , with a  medication  that I am not using at this moment because we made further progress of course, at a  hospital  , and this  hospital  at that time was called  Twelve Oaks Hospital 
At this time it's called  River Oak Hospital 
 Yep 
 Yes 
 And then, at what, at what, was there a time where you realized: This is actually working  ? 
 Well, now this was in  1977  , and (laughing) surprisingly, uh, uh, perhaps one of the 1st successful case where you can really, document a clear-cut improvement by doing the  scan  before and after 
It shows tremendous decrease of uh, uh,  tumors  which corresponded to  colon cancer  which spread to the liver 
(This guy was ?) 
(laughing) 
 (?) 
 (laughing) 
And uh, his case was so interesting, that when I sent it for press, the editors decided to put us on the cover, of the journal, the scan 
 Yeah 
 They decided to put on the cover of Science, showing the tumor before, and, after the treatment 
Eh, so this was uh , obviously 
 And then what happened  ? 
Didn't that m kinda, didn't word spread like wildfire and people, more and more people want to come and see you  ? 
 Ah, Absolutely, well the 1st excitement occurred, basically what the  President Nixon  promised ok 
 That he would deliver 
 Yeah 
 cancer cure  uh, by  ' 70 , uh  6, 1976  , and we did, ok, and we did deliver  cancer cure 
 Yeah 
 by  1976, 1977  ok, and um, the um, main uh event was the presentation of uh our theory on our research, on perhaps one of the largest uh scientific (congress ? conference ?) in  America  , involved  19,000  uh, researchers attended 
Eh this was annual meeting of the  Federation of the Societies of Experimental Medicine and Biology 
It happened that at that time it was in  Anaheim, California 
Uh, I sent uh, uh, the abstract of my presentation, and I was simply, patiently waiting until this would be shown, which was in  ' 76 
In  June '76  right before  4th of July  , and uh, I was surprised when they notified me that um, my abstract was selected out of one of few, which was in great interest of the news media, like  Associated Press  , for instance, and then when I did my presentation, then  Associated Press  decided to make a release of this, and then you can read about it in newspapers all over the world 
In uh, (laughing) distant places like  Buenos Aries  , receiving CBS newspaper clips from all corners of the world 
 And what was that like for you  ? 
I mean, how did that feel, just to see that your name was, all over the world  ? 
 This was the 2nd time, what (?) this happened to me, because 1st time it made such news, by working on brain  peptides  with  Professor Unger  ; this was around  ' 72 , and suddenly, this wasn't so much of my 
 Yeah, but still it was your (interest ?) 
 involvement, but I was working together with  Professor Unger  , and we made a great news, by discovery of, certain  peptide  in the brain, and then it spread all over the world, and then again, uh, uh,  CBS 
 What was that like ? 
I mean, how did you feel when you saw ? 
 Well, uh, it was surprising because uh suddenly we got uh news people coming, and the TVs from various countries, especially from  Europe  , for instance, from variety of corners, like from  Europe  , from  New Zealand  , from  Brazil 
You name it ok ? 
Eh, so there was a great excitement about it, but 1st time that this excitement happened was, is around  ' 72 , uh, really, eh, is typically what happened after such excitement, is the ? iation ?) 
ok 
 Yeah (laugh) 
 Well, uh, (laughing) the uh, establishment is and this um will attack you and will try to destroy you 
 Did you know that was going to happen before  ? 
 I knew it would because in  Poland  , uh, my father's, uh, gave me the book of um  MIT Professor  , uh,  Thomas Kuhn 
(here's a guy ? try to translate to (?) 
(laughing) 
 (?) yeah 
Yeah, probably 
 (laughing) sure 
and then uh, this was uh, the book which was titled eh,  Structures of Scientific Revolutions 
It happens that this book was translated to  Polish  language as couple of years after it was printed, in  U.S. ; which was around uh, I think  19  uh,  64  probably, ok 
So then I read the book, and the book shows uh, how, eh, the paradigm shift occurs, ok, and the, it never fails 
It always goes through the same stages 
1st it's short period of excitement, and the a long time of harassment and persecution, and then finally the brief period when uh, uh, if you survive, then uh, the other people say 
well it's obvious 
We always knew (laughing) that this 
 Yeah 
 was going to happen, ok  ? 
So I knew what was going to happen, uh, but uh, it was hard for me to believe it uh that, uh, in the  20th  century,  21st  century it could happen, ok, but then uh, when uh, I began going through this, it was like going to some uh, unpleasant disease 
You read about it in the books and 
 Yeah (?) 
 then uh, you finding one symptom after another, and it affects you 
 Yeah 
 and you know that it could be deadly, 
(?) survive 
 Well you could have ended up in prison, right  ? 
 Yeah 
 (?) 
 You may die before uh, you be able to do anything 
 Mhmm 
 So the advice of the author of the book, was that you have to start early to make some medical discovery, because you probably have years of harassment in front of you, and probably the best chance that uh, you get accepted if you live longer than your opponent, because some guys will never accept you (laughing) 
 Yeah 
 until they die 
So that's what happened 
Well then, of course, I witnessed what happened with  Professor Unger 
Yeah, he made the great news, and obviously I contributed to what he had, but he was uh, my boss, and then obviously I did not much, suffer much from retaliation, but he did, ok 
So there was retaliation, and uh, they accused him of everything possible, uh, finally causing for him to move from  Houston  to  Memphis  ,  Tennessee  , eh, zzz, about year later he died 
So unfortunately his research was never brought to the time when it was accepted, ok 
It was great research, ok, and if had really to more resource and time I can bring this to be accepted, because this isn't a completely different field 
This is brain function, memory, and  peptides  working in the brain 
But at that time unfortunately the project was killed, which is great loss for humanity, eh, 'cause the discoverer passed away, and the product was gone together with him 
It can be still resurrected, and I think it will be 
Eh, so then, for me, eh, it meant only advancement, unfortunately, because, uh, when uh, uh, he was stripped from the funds, I received funding from the  National Cancer  agency funding from the university, and I was able to support him, because he was stripped of his grants and funds 
So he was able to move forward with his research, but finally when he moved, I inherited very large laboratories 
My laboratory was located in 3 buildings 
So the lab space and uh, uh, some prime location, in the medical school 
So then I did very well, then, of course, the publicity occurred, and this publicity was centered around me, not around both of us 
 Yeah 
 at that time, in  ' 76 , and then again there was about 1/2 a year when there was a great enthusiasm, uh, good wishes, whatever, and after that, a retaliation occurred, ok 
So then obviously 
 Mhmm 
And what was, what, what was at the heart of the retaliation  ? 
 Uh, well, 
 The fact that their people didn't want this to come to the fore  ? 
 Initially there was some overtures to take away the discovery from me, and uh, for instance, uh, uh, uh,  Baylor College  congratulated me 
I received diploma, so suddenly became superstar, ok (laughing) 
 Yeah 
 and then, of course, uh, the wise people, the business people from the university said: "Look, probably we should talk now about patents, we should talk about pharmaceutical companies, we should try to, somehow, put this to motion," ok, and that's what we did 
So then uh, we talked to some of the best lawyers in the country 
Of course, uh, the university uh, are in control of this 
There were visits of uh, pharmaceutical companies 
I remember one of them came from the research center in  U.K.  , from  High  uh,  Wycombe  , and this was so (encouraging that ?) was very interested, what we do 
But then uh, the intention was just to take uh, my, uh, in, invention away from me, and obviously 
 Mhmm 
 I would have very little to, to, do to promote this, to develop this any further 
So I thought about it and I felt that I'm not going to do it 
There then uh, I was offered to join the mainstream cancer research at  Baylor  cancer medicine, and obviously uh, I would receive much better title, of professor 
 Yeah 
 and obviously there would be much better equipped laboratory, but again eh, they wanted me to, completely quit private practice of medicine, 'cause at the same time I was practicing medicine, which many researchers were doing 
I was working at  Baylor College  and then I was practicing medicine uh, outside  Baylor College  , in the group of the other  doctors 
So in this way I had some independence, because obviously, I could always practice medicine (laughing) 
 And did you always want to keep your independence, 
 Yes 
 and did you know that was always a good thing  ? 
 That's right, that's right 
Because I, I did not want to be uh, at the mercy of the university or the government 
Uh, but I still wanted to stay in academic surrounding, because obviously I came from a family which has great tradition of academic careers 
So that's something which obviously my father was always telling me that I should be really staying in the university, ok 
Eh, uh, uh, but finally I decided that I was not going to accept this offer because uh, why should I resign from my private practice 
 Mmm 
 It didn't hurt my research in any way 
So I decided to continue, and uh, then that's when the retaliation occurred, and uh, I was (crazy ?), harassed, and attacked, and finally 
 And how were you harassed  ? 
I mean, letters or (peop ?) 
 Mmm, well, as I could do the research for such a long time, because really, this was some like 7 years at the university, because uh, very few people in the university knew what I was doing, because I was only responding to the  National Cancer Institute  , and uh, I was not part of the mainstream cancer research center 
What happened is that uh, (laugh) I was employed by the  Department of Anesthesiology  , which obviously, on the surface has nothing to do with  cancer  , but, who cares  ? 
I was receiving grants from the  National Cancer Institute  , and so  Anethesiology  was a very wealthy department, and they had a lot of space, but they were doing very little research 
So they wanted to do some type of research, and uh, the chairman of the department was supportive of my doing  cancer research 
So basically I conducted uh,  Anethesiology 
laboratory into  cancer  , into  cancer research laboratory  , and very few people knew about it 
They learn about it 
when uh, the  Associated Press  (laughing) broke the news 
So then uh, the retaliation happened 
 Mhmm 
 and then they wanted me to join the mainstream, but obviously I was enjoying very much (laughing) working, in peace and tranquility, and responding only to the  National Cancer Institute 
So then uh, what happened at that time was that uh, obviously  Dr. Unger  , moved to another university, and um, uh, the chairman of the department uh, his uh, uh, employment was terminated, because it uh, he was involved in uh, the war between 2 superstars of (the ?) 
One of  Dr. DeBakey 
and the other one was  Dr. Cooley 
They were 2 famous, eh, eh, cardiovascular surgeons, who were competing with each other 
Ehhh, Dr., eh, the chairman of the department, was on the side of  Dr. Cooley  , but the boss of, uh,  Baylor College  was  Dr. DeBakey 
So after  Dr., Dr. DeBakey 
learned that, uh, the sympathy of  Chairman of the Department  ; which was  Dr. Cooley  , his job was terminated 
So then they, took another man; very old, professor, who was already retired, to be the chairman of the department 
They, he knew nothing about, any type of research (laugh), especially  cancer research  , and, uh, once I decided to not join the mainstream,  Baylor Research Center  , eh, the people who are in charge of  Baylor Research Center  , they put a pressure, on the new chairman of the department, and they frightened him, saying look, you are, uh, in a charge of anesthesiology, but here's a guy doing  cancer research  , eh, and see this was a great, uh, like liability to you, and pretty soon he may be sued, uh, without knowing what he's doing 
Ok 
So then, uh, they, they, um, brainwashed the old man, and he decided to strip me, slowly from my laboratories, eh, and, and, harass me 
Ok, uh, ultimately, he sent me the letter that, uh, in which he informed me that he does not see any connection between, uh, my research and anesthesiology; which was obvious, eh, but obviously I was doing the research which made the university famous, more or less 
 Yeah 
 So then one thing to another, and I decided, no, I am not going to work with, in this environment anymore, and I decided to do, try to do on my own, to start my own laboratory 
So that's what happened 
Ok 
 And then you did that  ? 
You had your own, laboratory  ? 
 Yes, and then I decided, this was just the beginning of 1977, and, uh, e, we put together a laboratory; of course I already had private practice, and, uh, I was still working 
 In your private practice 
 Yes 
 you were still seeing patients  ? 
 Absolutely, absolutely 
 Seeing any results  ? 
 Yeah, seeing patients, getting results 
I began  phase I clinical  trials 
 Mhmm 
 in the hospital where I was seeing patients 
I had patients at that time, in about 2 or 3 different hospitals, uh, but the hospital, where I get permission to do  clinical trials  , was a most supportive, and that's why I did it this way, and, uh, obviously it was necessary for me to build from scratch, the laboratory, the research laboratory 
I decided that I just, uh, I just, uh, make some funds in, our private practice, and at that time, of course, this was just, um, general (?) private practice, internal medicine private practice, em, and, uh, the funds which I produced in private practice I can use to, put together the laboratory, and that's what we did 
Ok 
Step by step we build the laboratory, and we expanded our private practice 
So basically, I switch from the government and then I found it best to fund the research, just privately funded research, which nothing unusual, thhh, some like 50 years before everyone was doing it 
 Everyone is doing this 
 Yes, and there's still some people, especially in the  U.K.  , who are doing this 
Ok 
 Yeah 
 Um, the most of the  discoveries  were made through the, sss, through the  research  that was funded, by the  researchers 
 Mhmm 
 There are also some, wealthy people who donated the money to do it 
So only after World War II, this was, um, the system was created where, the  researchers  became, um, really became the slaves so, the  government 
 Mhmm 
 and  pharmaceutical companies  , and new companies, and if they do not receive the money, they couldn't do anything 
This way I could have independence, and, uh, do whatever I want 
Yes 
 So at what point did it get to where, action was taken against you, and you knew that you were going to have to go to court  ? 
 The action, um, um, started very soon, and the, and began at the lowest level, which is like, county level, and then you go obviously 
 Mhmm 
 higher as you move along, and when, uh, I was leaving, uh, the university, the chairman promised me that (laugh) when I leave, uh, the obviously, quote, unquote,  " They will bust my ass" 
Ok  ? 
 Yeah 
 (laughing) 
 When leaving the university 
 When I was leaving the university  ? 
 Yeah 
 Yes 
And, uh, he promised me that, uh, they will trigger the action from  Harris County 's Medical Society ; which is probably the lowest level of harassment and just, the somewhat prestigious society if you are are a good  doctor  practicing  medicine  , in  Harris County  , where  Houston  is, then you should be a member of the  Harris County Medical Society 
Uh, if you are not a member of  Harris County Medical Socity  they won't grant you privileges to see patients in hospital 
So this was important to be a member of the  Harris County Medical Society  because I was  practicing medicine 
 Why do you think 
Why do you think they wanted to stop you  ? 
 Why did'd they wanted me to stop  ? 
 Yeah 
 Well, probably just for the heck of it 
I don't know 
 (Laughing: both) 
 Ok 
 Well do you think they were threatened by you  ? 
 Well, I doubt it 
Their probably some type of revenge 
Ehhh, since I didn't yield to their harassment, and I decided to do whatever I was doing, and decide to do it on my own 
 Mhmm 
 and they felt, well, let's try to kick his behind if we can 
Ok 
 Yeah 
 Well I don't think I was, uh, causing any threat to them at all, because this was really, large institution 
 So it escalated  ? 
 Yes 
Just starting at the lowest level 
It was, eh, unpleasant because they were dragging me to like, holy inquisition proceeding, explain what I was doing, and basically they're trying to force me to stop what I was doing by using various ways 
Obviously they didn't have any, uh, reason to do it because, uh, my  clinical research  ; which I was doing in the most, done under the supervision of,  Institutional Review Board  , and before I started anything I asked, uh, I retained  medical lawyers  , and I asked them to check, if I can, uh, for instance, do the  research  to use  medicine  , and use it, in a  patient  , and they 
checked with this, State authorities, Federal authorities, and at that time it was perfectly alright 
So I was doing, everything, legally 
So, they really couldn't do much, but, they were harassing me, asking for me to give them a lot of documents, whatever, and suddenly, all of it stopped 
It stopped because they were exposed by  news media 
 Yeah 
 So, when the article was written about it, they disappeared from, the horizon, and then they never, harass me since then (laugh) 
 Yeah 
 I think it's, lasted probably for, 2 or 3 years, and then it was gone, so 
 And then, and then how did that end up  ? 
How did you end up going to court for the 1st time then  ? 
 Oh well, so obviously there was no, uh, issue of going to court at that time, it was only the issue that, I might not be a member of, uh 
 But you might not have been able to  practice medicine 
 the medical society, and then I would not be able to see  patients  in the hospital 
Ok 
So this was deliberate, ok, and at that time, m, most of my  patients  were  treated  in the hospital, because I didn't have yet the system to use  treatment  outside the hospital, like for instance the pumps that we are using now 
They did not exist at that time 
So it was necessary to use I.V. posts 
 Mhmm 
 and, uh, and heavy pump, heavy  treatment 
So then, uh, so this was, uh, it started around '78, it continued for a couple of years, and then nothing happened after that 
I was visited by, um,  FDA  people, but we have pretty constructive meeting 
They didn't bother me, and, uh, the next attack occurred in a 1983, and this was by, uh,  Food and Drug Administration 
So, suddenly I was sued, and, um, they really wanted to put me out of business 
Ok 
 They didn't just want to put you out of business 
I mean, they wanted you, they wanted you to go to prison 
 No, in ni, 1983, they wanted me out of business 
 Right, just out of business 
 Yeah 
 Don't want you practicing 
 Shut down, what I am doing, and they did it, secretly (laugh) 
Most of this actions occurred around, uh, just before say  Passover  , and  Easter 
Ok 
 Yeah 
 Every year 
It never failed 
Ok (laughing), a, and a usually they were attacking, uh, uh 
 Someone 
 No, no 
For instance it happened for instance I was away, and, uh, they were filing papers in court, like, um, around 5 p.m. on  Thursday  , ok, and  Friday  was day off, because was big  Friday  ,  Good Friday 
Ok 
So then, obviously, um, they then 
realized I'd be away because I participated in some T.V. program, and they want to do it while I was away, but, uh, it so happens that 
a one of the friendly lawyers was in court at the time, and he overheard whatever they were doing, ok (laughing),they were going for injunction, ok, and so then, uh, I would be stopped immediately 
I wouldn't be able to do much, ok, until the judge would reverse it, but, uh, he read about it and he prepared immediately temporary restraining order, and filed at the same time (laughs) 
 Yeah 
 So then, uh, I could practice without any interruptions, but, uh, then, of course, 
 So do you think of all the people that were trying to stop you 
 Yeah 
 Do you think any of those people actually, really, genuinely believed that you were causing harm to people 
 Hmmm 
 or do you think that they were just stopping you because  ? 
 I think some stupid people,was at the lower level, like, uh, uh, some lower level  FDA agents  , they didn't know what they were doing 
They were manipulated, ok, but the guys who above, they knew very well (laughs) that, I was right 
 They knew what they were doing 
 Absolutely 
 They knew you were doing something 
 Absolutely, yes 
 groundbreaking 
 They knew very well, and that's the reason why they attack me 
Ok 
Yeah 
It's obvious 
So this 1st encounter, was relatively brief 
Uh, we went to court, which was Federal court, and the judge, uh, would rule in our favor, and the judge, uh, uh, in the verdict, uh, cleared me from any, of the charges, and, uh, I found that I could, uh, I could  treat  anybody, by using my methods, but I cannot really, uh, sell  medications  outside the  State of Texas  , and that's what I was not doing anyway 
So really, 
the judge 
affirmed what I was doing 
 Right 
 That I'm free to use my  invention  , and  treat  people in the  State of Texas  , which made, of course, the  government  , uh, people furious, and they threatened the judge 
They send the judge a letter saying that, if the judge will not rule their way, then they will go after me with criminal investigation, uh, with seizures, uh, eh, grand jury investigation 
That's what they did as the next step 
 When was the next step  ? 
How many years later was that  ? 
 Well again, there was some like couple of years when it was relative quiet 
Of course, in order to be, eh, in, eh, in order to do what I was doing, it was necessary for me to have inspection, by the inspectors, approved by the  FDA  , who 
check our manufacturing facility, and, ah, certify that what ever we do, we do right, and there are no discrepancies 
So this was obviously something, very difficult, because obviously we knew that the  FDA  inspectors 
will always find something wrong, you know 
 Yeah 
 So these agents are trained to always find something wrong, but anyway, at inspection, uh, found we are doing everything perfect 
Ok (laughs) 
So we were able to pass the inspection 
Uh, we are in full compliance with what is called  good manufacturing practices  , and then everything was quite until about 3 years later when, uh, there was a raid on our clinic by the  FDA  , and seizure of, ah,  medical records  , and then there was another, uh, obviously, ah, another, uh, part of the war began, and then, uh, we file a lawsuit against  FDA  , and, uh, as a result the judge forced the  FDA  to give back some, of the documents, and permit us to, uh, be able to copy the rest of the documents, and so then, uh,  FDA  began a grand jury process, and, uh, there was some, like 4 different grand juries, uh, ah, which did not find me, guilty of anything, and then finally 5th grand jury was able to indict me, which was in '95 
Ok 
 So when you were, when you were going to court; because I remember seeing in the 
 Yeah 
 Burzynski  , the movie 
 Yes 
 I remember seeing in the photographs 
 Yeah 
 around here 
 Sure 
 there were lots and lots of people outside there (?) 
 Yeah 
 What was that like to see that  ? 
 Oh well, ah, this was, uh, going for ever, going to court, and obviously I was going before this grand jury investigation, whatever, but ultimately, their lawsuit, uh, the trial began, in, ah,  January  of '96, and, uh, it took a number of months 
Ok 
So I was going to court almost every day, and the people realized what was going on, and they were giving us a lot of support 
So then you can see people outside the court 
 What was that like to see your patients  ? 
 Well it was, ah, it was, ah, very good, uh, uh, show of (laughs) 
 Yeah 
 patient solidarity 
They wanted obviously, to help us, and they knew that, uh, they have the power, and, uh, they knew that they were fighting for their lives 
Ok  ? 
So they, uh, were dedicated people 
It wasn't easy because this was winter, and it was raining, and so it was cold weather, but obviously 
 Were you prepared to, to face what you could have faced, you know, that you actually could have gone to prison  ? 
 Sure, yes 
I, I knew, but I was, convinced that I am going to win 
So, should I, obviously, statistically it was, uh, highly unlikely, but, uh (laugh) 
 Do you think that this will stop one day  ? 
 That people will just get off your back, and (laugh) 
 (laughs) 
 you know 
 (?) 
 and can see what you've done 
 (?) 
 and, and see that there's really something there 
 Absolutely 
 This is just the (?) 
 Absolutely, absolutely 
I 
That's what I was convinced was going, to happen, and, uh, I was convinced that we are going to win, with  FDA 
 Good, 'cause I mean, anyone does any  research 
 Yeah 
 you know 
I had this on here 
 Yeah, sure 
 which I'm sure you've seen, like on  Wikipedia 
 Yeah 
 and what it says 
That there's no convincing evidence 
 Yeah, sure 
 that a randomized controlled trial has, you know 
That your work, that, that there's nothing there 
 Yeah 
 What's that like when you come across that stuff 
Do you just not read it, and just 
 So (laughs) 
Simply don't pay attention to it, because it, it's not true 
Ok 
 Yeah 
 You won't be able to, do any,  clinical research  which we do, without convincing evidence, especially when you have the most powerful agency in the  government  which is against you 
 They're against you, but you've been working with them for, for 
 Yes, so since 1997 
Yes, but you see 
 Yeah 
 Obviously they didn't have any sympathy to us because they lost 
So they would love to find something which is wrong with what we are doing 
They would love to prove that the  treatment  doesn't 
 Yeah 
 So this is, very difficult 
Ah, so the fact that they've, um, agreed that what we have has value, and they allow us to do  phase 3 clinical trials  , it means that we are right 
Ok  ? 
 Yeah 
 Because, uh, uh, nobody who didn't have any, concrete  evidence  that it works, would be able to go as far 
Ok 
 Yeah 
 So whatever  Wikipedia  says, well, I don't care for them (laughing) 
 Ok, so, we, we talked a little bit about, what you, where you've come from, and what you've been through 
As far as your  treatment  , um, to  cancer  , and this I'm very interested in, and why you don't think  high doses  of  chemotherapy  is, is particularly helpful for the body, and what 
 Well it is generally wrong approach 
It can help, some  patients  , wi, with a rare form of  cancer  , but only, eh, in limited capacity 
Those who, are quote, unquote  " cured" , usually die later on from  adverse reactions  , of  chronic adverse reactions  from  chemotherapy  or  radiation  , or they develop secondary  cancer 
So certainly, there is, this is not such a  cure  which you have in mind, that, use the  treatment  ,  patient  recovers and lives normal life 
Such  cure  does not exist for  patients  who are taking  chemotherapy  or  radiation 
They will always suffer, some problems 
Either from  cancer  , or  radiation  ,  chemotherapy  , and there is only small minority of  patients  who have advanced  cancer  who can, have long term responses 
So obviously, this is unacceptable  treatment 
Of course, it was important at certain stage of development, but now, of course, uh, when we know more about  cancer  , it's becoming, uh, unacceptable, and I think it will disappear, from the surface of the earth, in another 10 years, or 15 years, and, uh, in the  medical  textbook, this will be described as strange period of time, when people were using some barbaric  treatment 
Ok 
 Mmm 
You have a number of different ways of  treating cancer 
So, one of them is the  antineoplastons 
 Yes 
 This, this, this is the  peptides 
 Mhmm 
 The, the this is the thing that my partner is on at the moment 
 Sure 
 in the  clinical trial  , and, uh, you've had some real great success 
 Mhmm 
 using that 
Right  ? 
 Yes 
 But you also have 
 Mhmm 
 another way, of, of, of  treating  , which is, using, it's using some sort of  chemotherapy  , but in  low doses 
 Well, um, um, whatever we are using we are using  treatment  which works on the  genes 
 Antineoplastons  work on the  genes  , and they work on about  100 different genes 
 So what are they doing to the  genes ? 
 Well, they work as  molecular switches 
They turn off the  genes  which are causing  cancer  , and turn on the  genes  which are fighting  cancer 
So, that's what they do, and they produce this in about  100 different genes 
It's not enough, to control all  cancer 
Actually you can control some  cancers  , but not all of them, because you may have, numerous  genes  involved, in  cancer 
Well, for instance, in average case of  breast cancer  may have  50 abnormal genes  involved 
Uh, in, uh, like  grade 3 brain tumors  , for instance,  anaplastic astrocytoma  you might  80  , or might be  100  , but if, uh, you go to  highly malignant tumors  like,  glioblastoma  , you have, probably about  550 
Eh, if you don't cover such a spectrum of  genes  , you won't, you're not going to have good results 
So that's why, we know from the very beginning that we have some limitations 
We can help some  patients  but not all of them, because, they have involvement of different  genes  which are causing, their  cancer 
So then you can still have these  patients  who are  combining  the  treatment  of  antineoplastons  ,with different  medications  which are in existence, which work on different  genes  , and this includes also some  chemotherapy drugs  , which are available 
Eh, so this means that, um, for the  patients  for whom we, cannot use  antineoplastons  , because they are not in  clinical trials  , then we are using combination  treatment  , which consists of  medication  which already, approved as prescription  medications  , and, uh, by using the right  combination  by knowing which  genes  we need to attack, we get much better results 
Now this also includes  chemotherapy  , but  we never use  ,  high-dose chemotherapy 
 If necessary  ,  we use low-dose chemotherapy  , and when you use  low-dose chemotherapy  you don't have, uh,  toxicity  , which is, bad 
We use this for 
 patients  continuously, without much problem 
 So, so one of the main reasons of using  low-dose chemotherapy  is to try and keep your immune system strong, as well  ? 
 No, to try to quickly decrease the size of the  tumor  , in  combination  with the other  medications 
We can use, for instance,  low-dose chemotherapy  and another  medication  which will increase activity,of  chemotherapy  , and as a result, you can have, as good, uh, uh, decrease of the  tumor  , with the  low-doses 
 when you use  heavy-dose 
Well, there's nothing unusual about it 
For instance, uh, many  doctors  are using  medications  which are quite  toxic 
 Mmm 
 And they, if they use the dosages, it's helpful to the  patient 
The question is, what dosage will you use  ? 
If you use the  dosages  which are not  toxic  , it may still help the results, for instance, eh, the  medication  which was introduced, in mid, uh, 18th century for a particle for heart failure, in  U.K.  by 
 Dr. Withering  , which was digitalis extract 
Obviously it was highly  toxic medication 
It can kill people, in dosages much smaller than  chemotherapy  , but if you use the right dosage, it can help people 
It was helping people for over 200 years 
So those are the question 
What kind of dosage do you use, and what combination do you use, and then, it can be useful 
 How did work that out then  ? 
I mean, how did you work out 
 Mhmm 
 that using small dosages of  chemotherapy  , could be effective  ? 
 Uh, well, uh, it's not only based on, uh, our  research  , it's based on the  research  of the other,  doctors 
There are numerous  publications  on the subject, and in many cases the low-dosages can be used more effective than high-dosages, and, uh, on the other hand, by doing  genetic testing  , we can identify, which, uh,  medications  are the best for the  patient 
 'Cause you use 
 (?) 
 'cause you use a lab, in  Phoenix 
Right  ? 
 Correct, yes 
 And, and how did you find out about them  ? 
Um, how did you  ? 
Yeah 
 Well, uh, uh, frankly speaking (laughs), 1st time I find about it by,  treating patients  who's referred to us by one of the best  oncologists  in the country 
He was usually treating some movie stars (laughs) 
 Yeah 
 and I found that this patient had, uh,  genetic testing  done, and I got interested in this, and I found about this laboratory 
It was some time ago, but anyway, while we were doing  genetic testing  before, but, uh, we didn't use this laboratory yet, we did it, through some other laboratories, and such  testing  was much, much simpler 
So, we are using such testing, for a number of years, but in the capacity we are using now, this is really the last 2 to 3 years 
 So what happens is someone's, bit of their tissue gets sent off to this lab  ? 
 Yeah, the tissue is sent to the laboratory, and, uh, they do,  testing  on the entire  genome  of  24,000 genes 
They identify the  abnormal genes  , and they go in-depth, by studying what happened to these  genes? 
Are they  mutated ? 
Are they  amplified ? 
And then from this, we have, a lot of information, and ultimately we like to know, which  medications  we can use to  treat genes 
What we are doing, we are  treating genes  , rather than, the  tumor  , as such 
 Mhmm 
 And, uh, if you identify all the  genes  that are involved, and find out which  medications  we can use, we can have very good results 
 And that's what you found  ? 
 That's right 
 So in some case you're  treating  people that might have a certain type of  cancer 
 Yes, mhmm 
 with a  drug  that was designed for a different type of  cancer 
 Uh, that's right, because we are  treating  the  genes  , and, uh, if you find out that, this particular  patient  has, uh, an  abnormal gene  , which is not typical for this  cancer  but we have  medication 
 Hmmm 
 that works on this  gene  , that's what we use 
 So I would imagine that to  treat  , uh, that to  treat  people, this way, is obviously the future 
Everyone's different 
Everyone's  genetics  are d, d, different 
 That's right 
 genetic markers  , but to treat them that way, would require a bit more work 
 That's, uh, obviously (laughs) (a life's ?) work 
Uh, uh, we'll, like, uh, not just simply for, eh, uh, 4 different types of  lung cancer 
 Yeah 
 Maybe 100,000 different types of  lung cancer  , each with, different, uh,  genetic signature  , ok, and once you identify this, then you can treat, such  patients  logically, and have good results, and if you do it on the scale of, uh, the entire country, this would, uh, give you much better results, and, uh, great savings, because 
 Mmm 
 you won't use expensive  medications  for everybody, but perhaps for 10% of the population, and then for this 10% of population is going to work 
 Yeah 
 Which means that these people will avoid disability 
They won't spend time in the hospital 
Uh, they will have short course of  treatment  , and then they go back to work 
So the  government  would understand, uh, that's something that can give them a lot of savings 
I think they will go for it 
Eh,  gene testing  , eh, at this time is still, uh, relatively expensive 
It's covered by, uh, the insurance of the  United States  , but for people outside, may cost 5500 euros, for instance, but I think it will be substantially less expensive in the near future 
I think it will be below $1,000 for complete  testing 
So for running the  test  , uh, uh, eh, and, uh, finding out which  treatment  , has the best chance, you can save, 100's of 1,000's of dollars for individual  patients 
 Yeah, but obviously  pharmaceutical companies  probably wouldn't be too happy about that 
 No, no 
 People aren't going to be taking their  medications  anymore 
 Well obviously be mostly happy that they can sell a lot of  medications  , but some of them are beginning to pay the attention, because they have to, because if they don't, their competitors, will pay the attention 
 Mmm 
 Obviously, they would like to have, possibly, the best possible results, in  clinical trials  , so now they begin to screen population of  patients  for  clinical trials  , and do some limited,  genetic testing  , but, so, of course, they do it, uh, for the better of  clinical trials  so have best results 
 Yeah 
 Doesn't mean that they'll do, do it when they sell  medicine  , to millions of people commercially 
They may forget about mentioning this  medicine  works the best for 
 Yes 
 this population of  patient  (laughs) 
 So what's your, your vision  ? 
Wha, wha, what do you, striving to achieve  ? 
 Well what I am trying to achieve is to introduce the way we  treat patients  , in, in various countries in the world, and, uh, what this would accomplish is, 1st of all, much better results of the  treatment  , much simpler  treatment  where perhaps only 1% of  patient  would need hospitalization, which would, uh, result in great savings 
Uh, the  treatment  , uh, will be done for shorter period of time 
For instance, few months to get rid of the  tumors  , then, uh, perhaps a year, to stabilize the results, and then go back, working and living, ok, without  cancer 
This, uh,  genetic  ,  genomic testing  would be absolutely done for every  patient  who will come for  treatment  , to identify, what is the best  treatment combination  indication 
So that's what I would like to foresee, and then, of course, um, immediately, you substantially reduce, the expenditures for  medical 
For instance, if, you assume that in the mid, medium-sized country, will spend, for instance, a billion dollar, for, socialized  medical treatment  which will coincide with hospitalization 
Ok 
Uh, then, uh, most of the cost is for hospitalization, and services necessary for keeping the  patient  in hospital, then  treating adverse reactions  , which are, occurring because of the poor selection of  medications 
Eh, then if you switch to the  outpatient treatment  because you use  medications  which are not going to give such bad,  side-effects  , because you select this  medication  based on  genomic testing  , ok, and then immediately instead of a billion dollars a year, you cut down your expenditures to about $100,000 
 Yeah 
 100 million dollars 
Ok  ? 
Probably slash it 10 times 
Ok  ? 
And then people will be happy because, ah, the don't need to stay in the hospital for a long time 
They have less  adverse reactions 
They can go to back to work, much sooner 
Ok 
So that's what I, can foresee as, the  treatment  in the future 
Not really hospital-based  treatment 
 Mhmm 
 for  patients  , and most hospitalization is required because of  adverse reactions  from  chemotherapy  ,  radiation  , but  outpatient treatment  , much easier  treatment  , also 
 medication  given in tablet forms, for instince 
 And that's what you're doing here, right  ? 
I mean 
 Correct, yes correct 
Usually in hospital, only, perhaps, for, one or two percent of  patients  , and, we would like to avoid it because when the  patient  goes to the hospital, he can pick up, some in-opportunistic infection, and then we are talking about more problem 
Of course, I believe detection of  cancer  will be very important, because you don't want to, uh, have a  patient  who is so advanced that he is fighting for, life, and he needs to be in the hospital 
Ok 
 Yeah 
 If you had  diagnosis  in the early stages, then the  patient  does not need hospitalization 
He can be  treated  very easily, then go back to work 
So that's the issue 
And of course prevention is another important issue to us 
To identify, changes in the body, which may indicate that the  patient  has already, early stages of  cancer  , also based on  genetic tests  , and get rid of this by using, behavior modification, by using proper diet, by using supplements, whatever, even without any  medications 
 So, you're obviously very passionate about what you do 
Right  ? 
That, that's my question about that 
 Well, I think it can help s, people in a great way, and, uh, 
 Well it can, I mean 
 Yeah 
 You have had so many su 
 Yes 
 I mean, I was talking to my girlfriend 
 Yeah 
 the other day, 
 Yeah 
 I mean, people, you know, you hear people say, this is a scam, and I was thinking, well the, if it is a scam 
 Yeah 
 it has to be one of the biggest scams ever 
 (laughing) 
 because all you've gotta do, is look on the walls 
 Yeah 
 and you look at those photographs 
 Yeah 
 Perhaps, this won't surprise you 
I've spoken to some  oncologists  just in the  U.K.  , and they say, all of these people that you have helped, they either ever had  cancer  in the 1st place 
 Mhmm 
 or they were  misdiagnosed 
 Yeah 
 or, uh, they went into  spontaneous remission 
 Yeah, well 
 or they, it was the  chemotherapy  or  radiation 
 These people, they don't know what they do 
They never, have never seen our results, and obviously they can't believe that something like this could happen, but suddenly (laughs), in this room we are in now, we have some of 
the  top experts  in the country, like people from  FDA  , who are  expert oncologists  , specialists 
 They're working with you 
 Oh, they came here to inspect what we have 
 Yeah 
 They look at every  scan  of the people who are in  clinical trials  , and they decided that we have very good results 
 And is that stuff going to be  published  at some point  ? 
 Ah, yes, we are publi, we are preparing this for  publication  , but, uh, obviously, in order to have the right results, you need, time, and most of our  clinical trials  began, approximately 10 years ago 
So then we, if you would like to know what happen after, 10 years with these people 
 Mhmm 
 then you need to have a little time 
So now we are preparing a number of, uh,  publications  , uh, and so this year we should have a number of  publications  , which will show  final results 
So far we didn't have,  final results  , so were only  interim reports  , during the course of  clinical trials 
 And with, uh, with  brain tumors  ; because obviously, that's an area that you've had 
 Yeah 
 huge suc, success rate 
 Yeah 
 What, why has that, do you think, as opposed to the other, types  ? 
 Because that's where we selected 
 Mhmm 
 We wanted to have something difficult 
Ok (laughs) 
 Yeah 
 Because, uh, for the same reason that you mentioned 
If you'd had something easier then, the  doctors  could say: "Well, this  cancer  usually disappears in its own" 
And they are right 
Some  cancers  may disappear on its own, in some higher percent than the others 
 Mhmm 
 But you know,  brain tumors  , you read, they never disappear on their own 
 Yeah 
 So that's why we, decided to select such type of  malignancies  which are the most difficult 
 So what's that been like when you've seen, I mean, I've seen obviously  Jodi Fenton 's  story 
 Yeah 
 Whe, whe, when you see these people's 
 Yes 
 uh,  scans 
 Yeah 
 and you see that that  tumor  has  shrunk 
 Yeah 
 or  broken down 
 Yeah 
 wha, what does that feel like  ?  (laughing) 
 Well, we see this all the time 
(?) it just happens almost every day 
Even today that we saw the  patient  , uh, who has  pancreatic cancer  , and after a few months of  treatment  it's practically gone, and she is the wife of a  doctor  (laughs) 
They came together, and that's, that's what we see practically every day 
Ok 
 That must give you great strength to 
 Absolutely 
 continue 
 Absolutely, yes 
So that's something which is gratifying (laughs) 
 Yeah 
What do you think the future is as far as  drugs  for  cancer  are concerned  ? 
 I believe that, we are still at a very early stages of development in this area, but the future will be, with  medications  which are, highly specific, they will work on the  genes  that are involved in  cancer 
So, they will not harm normal part of the body, and, du, du, how to combine this  medications  will be established by, the special software, which will guide the  doctors  how to use proper  medication  for individual  patient 
I think this will be the, um,  treatment  that will be designed for, individual  patient  , and such design, it is not necessary to be done by the  doctor 
I think it should be, uh, certain computerized system which will put together, the best possible  treatment  plan, for a  patient  ; which obviously needs to be checked and approved by the  doctor 
So I believe that this will be the future of  medicine  for the next, say, 40, and 50 years, coming up with better and better  medications  , which will be  genomic switches  , which will turn off, the  cancerous process  by regulating the  genes  which are involved; they simply will bring, the activity of these  genes  to normal levels, and finally, the new generation of  medication  which should work on  cancerous stem cells  , and, the  medications  which can kill  cancerous stem cells  without, uh, producing any harm to normal  stem cells 
So this will be the clue for, long-term control of  cancer  , because if you don't eliminate,  cancerous stem cells  then the  cancer  will come back 
 Yeah 
 And that's why  chemotherapy  , usually is unable to control  cancer  for a long time because, it's pretty much powerless, ah, uh, regarding action on  cancerous stem cells 
But then after that, I think that we will make another, jump, and there will be, uh, procedures that will based on  biophysics 
 Mmm 
 and by trying to get rid of, uh, the  cancer  and some of the  diseases  by effecting the body by using various, uh, wipes, which will be like magnetic wipes, it will be some other types of wipes, but using proper frequencies to, normalize all the cells in the body to normalize the activity of the  genes 
I think this will be a 
 Mmm 
 probably the next, uh, say 50 years of, uh, the end of this century when such (?) 
 So no one's getting funding really, unless they're doing it privately to, 
being able to, isn't that being able to  research  these areas, because funding really comes from  pharmaceutical companies ? 
 Ah, well, most of this funding is from  pharmaceutical companies  , and also it is coming from the  National Cancer Institute  but, I think it's regulated behind the scenes by the  pharmaceutical companies 
Eh, but they are still some researchers who are trying to do it on their own 
Very few of them 
I think there's articles, in the  Science  magazine, some time ago which was talking about, uh, few of these researchers who are still trying to do, research on their own, and, I think, uh, I think there were probably some 4 or 5 of them in  U.K.  (laugh) 
 Yeah 
 still involved in research on their own 
 So what ah, what about the role of the mind  ? 
Do you think that, if someone has  cancer  and they wanna be well, do you think the way that someone thinks is important  ? 
 Absolutely, that's very important because, this, uh, can be translated, ah, to various biochemicals which can influence  cancer 
So obviously this is very important but, the question is how to, ah, direct this in the proper way 
Ok 
How to quantify this 
So that's something that should be done in the future 
 And nutrition as well 
 Yes, absolutely, yes 
Why all have a lot of important chemicals in nutrition which can effectuate  cancer  , but regarding the mind you have to translate, uh, for instance, biophysical factors, in the brain, into biochemical factors, and certainly, that's what the body's doing all the time, but how to mobilize it, that's a different story 
Yeah 
 So if someone wants, if someone came to the  Burzynski Clinic  , wh, wh, what could they expect, to happen here  ? 
 Well 1st of all, we would like to give a selection, and we don't want the people who we cannot  treat  to come 
Uh, at this time we rather avoid, uh,  patients  in early stages of  cancer  , because with such  patients  , uh, what is used is  standard of care treatment  , and we prefer to refer them to, ah, different  doctors 
So we prefer to  treat  it once  cancer patient  , because, uh, they cannot be helped by the other  doctors  , and, uh, when they come to our clinic, we try to find out 1st, see if we can really help them or not, and, uh, once they come to the clinic, in most of the cases we can try to, help them, of course, and, uh, we put together, the  personalized treatment  plan, which is (?) 
 But all of those go through you 
You look at every single one of those 
 Yes 
I'm seeing every  patient  , who's coming, if I'm 
 Yeah 
 if I'm around here, but, after that all the  patients  are really assigned to different  senior physician  and they're responsible for daily care of  patient  here 
 How many people do you have, working here now  ? 
 About 150 people here, yes 
 And you started with, well, just one (?) 
 Eh, I think really when we moved from  Baylor College  I had about 7 people at that time 
 Yeah 
 Yes, because, some of these  doctors  who are working together at  Baylor College  decided to leave together with me, including my wife, because she was also working at  Baylor College 
 Yeah 
 Ok 
 Thank you 
 You're welcome 
My pleasure 
 Thank you so much 
 Thank you very much
Ok
