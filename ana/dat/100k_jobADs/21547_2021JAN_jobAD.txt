  Microaggressions In The Workplace: Definitions, Examples, And How To Start The Conversation  
 Jenna Arcand 
 July 27, 2020 
   
 On a recent episode of JT Talks Jobs, we invited Stacey Lewis, founder of HR Interrupted, back to continue our conversation on race and the workplace. The topic? Microaggressions. 
 "Racism has been able to fly under the radar in the workplace," says Lewis. "These microaggressions, this is kind of the foundation of it." In order for us to make our workplaces safer and more equal for all of our colleagues, we need to learn what microaggressions are and do some self-reflection—and then apply what we learn to the workplace. Here's what J.T. and Stacey covered in their latest conversation. 
 What Is A Microaggression? 
 Microassaults, microinsults, and microinvalidations all fall under the umbrella of microaggressions. The common definition of a microaggression is as follows: a statement, action, or incident regarded as an instance of indirect, subtle, or  unintentional discrimination  against members of a marginalized group such as a racial or ethnic minority. Lewis prefers a shorter, more concise definition, which she shared during the livestream. Microaggressions, in her experience, can best be summed up as "brief, everyday exchanges that send denigrating messages to a certain individual because of who they are." Microaggressions are like little jabs or cuts. They pick away at a person. They may seem harmless or insignificant in the moment (and to those of us who have white privilege), but they add up when they happen every day.  Both of these definitions are easy to understand. But when it comes to real life, are we aware of the microaggressions that occur in the workplace on a daily basis?  
 Examples Of Microaggressions 
 "You don't know what you don't know," Lewis says. "When you know, you do better."  It's important to learn how our words and actions can affect our colleagues at work, and what words and actions are hurtful and harmful. If you realize you've said some of the following at work, don't be defensive and don't beat yourself up. Education is power.  So, think about your conduct in the workplace. Have you said any of these things at work? "No, where are you REALLY from?" "What are you?" "You don't act like a normal black person." "I don't see you as black." "No, you're white." "I don't see color when I see you." "I am not racist. I have a lot of black friends." The following examples of microaggressions at work are a little more subtle:   "You are so smart and articulate." "So, you don't speak Spanish?" "You're really pretty for a dark skin person." "Why do you sound white?" A common microaggression scenario we see in the workplace is when a person of color presents something to a few colleagues and somebody asks, "Was this information vetted?" It is okay to ask this question if everyone is asked it. Don't single a person out. Note: It is always okay to  compliment someone . Just don't add "for a ____ person" to the end of the compliment. If there is something you admire about a person, tell them. Don't take the humanity out of the workplace...which brings us to our next point.  
 How To Have A Conversation About Microaggressions In The Workplace 
 For those of you not knowing how to approach someone at work about microaggressions, there are a few things you can do to  start a conversation  on the topic. When you are a victim of a microaggression, don't be afraid to stand up for yourself. You can control how you react, but you can't control their behavior. Lewis encourages you to respond to the microaggression with something like this: "When you said that, it hurt my feelings. Let me help you with that. Let me tell you why that's a problem for me, why that frustrated me and made me mad. Let me tell you why that's a problem statement." You can also use intellectual curiosity to your advantage. Ask the person, "What's the foundation of your statement?"  Both of these options allow a conversation to occur. It helps the victim of the microaggression share their experience with the colleague. Let's remember that this education process goes both ways, though. If you've realized you've committed a microaggression at work, seek to understand. Give your colleague an opportunity to explain why what you said hurt them. Pay attention. Ask, "Why is that important to you?" But consider your relationship with the person before you have this conversation. If you've never talked to them before, don't make this the icebreaker.  Humanity is at the heart of these conversations. When we look at race in the workplace, we have a tendency to overthink and take the human component out of it. "Sometimes we want to make this so hard because we really don't want to change," Lewis says.  If you want to change, start having these uncomfortable conversations at work. The result? Trust, respect, and a deeper connection with your colleagues.

  Race & The Workplace: How To Create A Diverse Workforce  
 Aaron Sanborn 
 June 22, 2020 
   
 Many companies say they have a diverse and inclusive workforce, but just because companies have employees of different races and cultures, doesn't necessary mean those companies are diverse. 
 To truly understand whether or not a workforce is diverse, business leaders must be willing to look within, and ask tough questions. 
 Stacey Lewis, founder of HR Interrupted, recently sat down with Work It Daily founder and CEO, J.T. O'Donnell, for an episode of "JT Talks Jobs." Lewis said one of the biggest mistakes companies make is hiring diverse candidates for the sake of having a diverse workforce, without first truly committing to a culture change and building a strategy for these employees to be successful. To have a diverse workforce that is meaningful, companies should keep the following things in mind: 
 Leadership Must Be Committed To A Culture Change 
 This commitment involves everyone, from the CEO, to department managers and supervisors, and human resources. Lewis said when crafting policies about diversity,  leadership has to plan  on these employees playing important roles in the company, not think of them as a diversity quota. "We can put on our roster or website that we have a black person, but what practices and policies do you have in place to make sure that black employee has a path in the organization, or are they just good for the website?" Lewis asks. "It has to be more than just a hire. It is a culture change."  Lewis says it's no good having a lot of black people on staff if there's no defined roles or path forward. She said she would rather have two strong black workers on staff than 15 that are only there to project a sense of diversity for the company. If leadership wants a diverse company, they need to properly plan for it, otherwise it's just a feel-good measure. 
 Make Sure Your Employees Feel A Sense Of Belonging 
 Managers and supervisors need to make an effort to get to know their employees, and understand their strengths and weaknesses. Most importantly, you need to get a sense of whether each employee feels like they belong within the company.  Being a minority employee in a workforce striving for diversity is like being invited to a party. But just because you're invited doesn't mean you're going to have a good time, according to Lewis. When it comes to the difference between diversity, inclusion, and belonging, Lewis breaks it down like this. Diversity -  Gets you invited to the party. Inclusion -  Means when you're at the party, you get invited to dance. Belonging -  Means you actively plan the party. "It's about being invited to the table," Lewis says.  If you're not familiar with your workforce, or have a path in place for your minority employees to advance their careers and continually engage with the company's growth, you'll never know whether they feel a sense of belonging. An example of a diversity policy not working is a company's only black employee working in the same position for 15 years, according to Lewis. It's very likely that the employee never felt a sense of belonging at the company, was never properly engaged, and isn't happy in their job. 
 Take Advantage Of Employee Resource Groups 
 Employee resource groups are groups of employees who join together in their workplace based on shared characteristics or life experiences. ERGs are generally based on providing support, enhancing career development, and contributing to personal development in the work environment. If your company's diversity policies are working well, these groups should form organically, and will further engage your workforce. In addition to the employee resource groups, it's also helpful to have an overall diversity committee with a mixture of employees and managers from all cultures.  The committee and resource groups can act as a checks and balances for company leadership to make sure the company's diversity plans are working, and that all employees feel a sense of belonging in the company. Such groups can also organize special training opportunities pertaining to race and culture, and help to facilitate important conversations. Having a diverse workforce is just a label if you don't put the proper effort into it.  Every employee should feel a sense of belonging and have the same opportunities to advance their careers.  If done right, a company gains high-quality employees that can bring a unique background and perspective to the company, and ultimately make the company stronger.

  Race & The Workplace: What Employers And Employees Should Know  
 Jenna Arcand 
 June 18, 2020 
   
 It is long overdue that we have a serious conversation about race and the workplace. That's why in a recent episode of JT Talks Jobs, Work It Daily founder and CEO, J.T. O'Donnell, invited special guest Stacey Lewis, founder of HR Interrupted, to talk about how we should address race in the workplace. 
 According to Lewis, here is what employers and employees should know about race and the workplace. 
 It Starts With Education 
 "When you go to the doctor and something is wrong with you," Lewis says, "you don't automatically go to the treatment. There has to be a diagnosis." Lewis uses this metaphor to explain the best approach to addressing race and white privilege at work.  Before we can ask "How can we address privilege?" we first need to know the "what" and the "why." "It's so easy to jump into 'I got to do something,'" Lewis says. "But you won't be effective until you know the symptoms." In order to understand the "what and the "why," workplaces should focus on education first.  
 What Does The Education Process Look Like? 
 Especially with a topic like white privilege, it's important to educate the workforce on what certain terms mean and how they apply to each of us differently.  "When you really understand the definition of white privilege only means that you probably have had some difficult times in life—no one is taking that away from you," Lewis says. "But your race, being white, probably was not a contributing factor to those difficulties.  That's  what white privilege means." Lewis goes on to say that once the education process begins, and the more we become educated about these issues and terms in the workplace, it allows us to step back. It allows us to reflect and realize that our character is not being attacked, and there's some reality to these things. There is no need to go on the defensive. It may be uncomfortable at first, but that's the whole point. Change doesn't occur when we stay in our comfort zones, blind to the realities of our lives and the lives of our colleagues. It starts with education, the "what" and the "why." That initial education also opens the door for more learning.  Narrative is another important term to know in the workplace. "Narrative is the story. What we've been told. The establishment. What has gone forward." Lewis says. "When we say we want to change the narrative, we want to change the story. We want to change the belief. We want to change what has been told." Every workplace that wants to—that needs to—change should think about the narrative, what we've been told about a certain race of people and what we do with that in the workplace. Change begins with an understanding of narrative and white privilege, and also of tone profiling, white centering, unconscious bias, and microaggressions. This is where employers and employees need to start when approaching race in the workplace. This is what the education process looks like.

  Post-Crisis Interview Questions: What They Are & How To Answer Them  
 J.T. O'Donnell 
 Work It Daily 
 June 10, 2020 
   
 COVID-19 is changing a lot of things in the world, and it will change the way job seekers prepare for interviews. When hiring new employees, employers will be asking different questions and looking for different answers than they previously did. 
 "When you start to go out and interview, you're going to get asked questions, and when you can convey these things through your answers, you are going to improve the chances that you get chosen for the job because you are giving off the persona (the professional presence) that's going to give employers the confidence and trust to hire you." Here are some key questions employers will ask post-COVID and how job seekers can successfully answer them.
