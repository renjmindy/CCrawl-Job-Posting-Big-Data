 The Great Cookie Caper 
  09 Mar  
 Call Scooby Doo. Call Sherlock Holmes. Heck call my cousin Sherlock Bones. We have quite the mystery here at the Hotel Thompson. This is cookie season - you know Girl Scout cookies. We here ❤ the Girl Scouts. Our front door has a sign that reads, "No Soliciting… unless you have Girl Scout Cookies". That sign is fully enforced - snorts and rolls with laughter. 
 So mom buys boxes of Girl Scouts cookies (I'm ashamed to say how many but I can tell you they freeze well for during the year in emergency cases). She gets her box of gold and brings them home. Dad's all time favorite is Samoas. Dad's mouth has been watering all day long since mom called and told him she had him a stash. He gets him a tall glass of milk and he is going to have him a few while watching Jeopardy - which is another post for another day. 
 He reaches for his box and what the pig? The box is light. Maybe it's a new formula - light? Snorts - no really the box is empty! What the cream cheese he says followed by where are my cookies?! I need cookies in my belly. He bellows for mom to come here. She does and he hands her the box and says, "Are you playing with me?" That's when she feels the box which is EMPTY. The box is sealed, stamped and still intact. Mom takes these pictures for proof. 
 Someone had ONE job to do and guess what? They failed miserably! Snorts. Mom called the person she bought the cookies from and explained what happened. Even he was like what? Mom did bring the box to the guy the next day and the box was replaced but…the mystery is still there. What happened to the cookies? 
 Were they not put in the box to begin with? Were they invisible for people on a DIEt? How many other people got empty boxes? Has this happened to you before? 
 And let me just nip the rumor going around - snorts oinks - me and Houdini did NOT - repeat DID NOT - have anything to do with the mysterious disappearance of dad's cookies. There was no Mission Impossible music playing and there was no ninja moves being done by either of us. For real. Innocent the both of us.
