 Collection of Old Funny/Nice Photos from My Teaching Career 
 November 4, 2018   laviemathématique 
 I have a file folder at my house of nice notes that I've received from students over the last five years that make me smile when I look at them. I also have photos I've taken that do the same that have been sitting on my school computer. My district has decided that they will be replacing all our Macs with Windows Surface laptops whenever they get a tech ticket about our incredibly slow Macs. So, even though I do frequent backups, I would like somewhere else where I can access these photos in the event that my computer loses its files. And I've realized this is fun to do. Here they are:

 I gave each student one notecard for their final. This was the only thing written on one from my French foreign exchange student.

 Found on my board at the end of the day one day. 
   
 After showing them Lose Yourself (In the Digits) ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2uVoDxZpaQ ) on Pi Day, I said I wanted some pi bling. These students made some for me.

 They found out my birthday was on one of the last days of school.
