 We are working with a top tier buy side firm whose systematic trading team are dedicated to building a machine-driven investment pipeline that can tackle problems of scale far beyond the reach of traditional investment approaches.

They engage with work every day motivated to learn something new about the world that has yet to be discovered (and has not been previously documented in academic literature). 
 They are looking for a talented quantitative researcher to join the team. Successful candidates should be capable of developing novel techniques, building unique insights, and engineering robust systems that will be used in trading strategies. The ideal candidate brings a combination of strong technical skills, a passion for creative problem solving, and an intense and wide-ranging curiosity about financial markets and human behavior. 
 Responsibilities:

 Develop automated investment models based on internally peer-reviewed research projects 
 
 
 Develop unique insights into various datasets and share with other team members in a cooperative set-up 
 
 
 Use mathematical tools to analyze and optimize monetization of forecasts 
 
 
 Quantitatively measure and control the risk of a portfolio of instruments 
 
 
 Apply scientific methods to improve the efficiency of a research and trading pipeline 
 
 
 Requirements: 
 
 
 Masters or doctorate degree in a quantitative discipline, such as statistics, mathematics, physics, electrical engineering, computer science, or operations research 
 
 
 Experience using sophisticated mathematical tools, generalizing these tools to different contexts 
 
 
 Experience analyzing real world problems and large amounts of empirical data with a disciplined scientific approach 
 
 
 Capable of pursuing the application of machine learning and advanced statistical techniques 
 
 
 Strong written and verbal communication skills, especially on technical subjects 
 
 
 Curiosity driven mindset with ability to explore uncharted territory 
 
 
 Highly motivated and willing to take ownership of work 
 
 
 Familiarity in at least one programming language (C++ and Python preferred) 
 
 
 Maximum of ~5 years of experience in the financial industry is preferred, but not required
