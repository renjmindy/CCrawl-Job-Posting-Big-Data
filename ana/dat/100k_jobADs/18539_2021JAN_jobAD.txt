 There are so, so many awful things going on now in the Presidential race, a race that gets uglier and uglier by the day. The GOP candidate keeps talking more and more about cheating and rigged elections and whipping up his supporters into such a frenzy, and it's having such a deleterious effect. The hatred, the vitriol, the sheer "war mentality" that we're saying every day on the news is just so vile. For a long time I tried to fool myself by saying "This will all go away on Nov. 9, when the schmuck goes back to TV where he can be a harmless buffoon again," but now I wonder just how long his poison will seep into our society. 
 One of the things that as an ex-newspaper scribe I've paid a lot of attention to is papers that never have endorsed a Democrat, or haven't for 100 years or something, telling its readers it should vote for Hillary Clinton. Because Trump is just that toxic. What has happened, sadly, is those newspapers have been subject to harassment, death threats, and all kinds of awfulness. 
 For the most part, the newspapers haven't gone public with it. But the Arizona Republic's publisher  didn't want to stay quiet, and she wrote this amazing essay  about exactly what has happened since the Republic endorsed Clinton. Mi-Ai Parrish wrote one of the best things I've read all year; I urge you to read it. 
 Quick excerpt: "  To those who said we should be shut down, burned down, who said they hoped we would cease to exist under a new presidential administration, I give you Nicole. She is our editor who directs the news staff, independent of our endorsements. After your threats, Nicole put on her press badge and walked with her reporters and photographers into the latest Donald Trump rally in Prescott Valley, Ariz. She stood as Trump encouraged his followers to heckle and boo and bully journalists. Then she came back to the newsroom to ensure our coverage was fair. Nicole knows free speech requires an open debate . 
 Parrish's defense of  liberty and press freedom is fantastic;  she is absolutely right to call out these criminals for what they are. And the last few lines hit home. 
 Nov. 9 can't get here soon enough. 
 **Next up today, every week "Saturday Night Live" has been given incredible material from this Presidential campaign, and you would think it might be hard to keep making up quotes that are funnier or more ridiculous than those surrounding the vulgar, talking yam Mr. Trump. 
 But gotta give it up to "SNL," they keep bringing the funny. This was maybe my favorite skit yet, especially the opening "sizing up" by the two candidates, and then Kate McKinnon's remarks about the four women from Bill Clinton's past who were present at the debate. 
 McKinnon's going to become quite famous the next four years… 
 **Finally today, yesterday was one of those joyous Sundays where I didn't have to watch the New York Jets lose. OK, OK, it's because they don't play until tonight. Still, a happy day! Some quickie-thoughts on another NFL Monday where I'm reminded no one knows anything about what will happen in this league… 
 -OK, this Dak Prescott thing is no longer a fluke, nice little story about a quarterback filling in for a starter and maybe giving the Cowboys a QB controversy. No, after Dallas thrashed Green Bay on the road, 30-16 Sunday to improve to 5-1, there's no way on Earth Tony Romo should get his job back. Prescott finally threw an interception, but he's looking like a 10-year vet, and it looks like he'll be a huge star in this league. 
 Which means, because he plays for the Cowboys, we'll all start hating him soon. 
 -- The Cowboys are for real, and the Carolina Panthers are toast. Super Bowl runner-ups are inexplicably horrible this year. I mean, I know a lot of Super Bowl losers have tough seasons the next year, but this bad? The pride of Charlotte gave up 41 points to a bad New Orleans team, and even a late furious rally couldn't prevent them from going 1-5. Cam Newton looks pedestrian, the defense stinks, and they're not going to the playoffs this year. Wow. 
 -- Hey, a Colin Kaepernick sighting! On the field, and not just during the national anthem! The 49ers QB who has sparked a whole lot of athlete activism the last two months actually played in a game Sunday. He didn't play great but wasn't terrible, either, going 13-of-29 for 187 yards and a touchdown. But he also wore a c ool Muhammad Ali T-shirt to his post-game press conference , so I enjoyed that. Let's hope Kaepernick starts playing well and continues to get his message out. 
 "I don't understand what's un-American about fighting for liberty and justice for everybody," Kaepernick said. "For the equality that this country says it stands for." 
 Exactly. Keep talking, Colin. 
 -- Do the Giants play more crazy games than anybody else, or does it just seem that way? Eli and enormous brat Odell Beckham Jr. pulled another one out of the hat Sunday over the Ravens. 
 -- Finally, very few people care but my man Cody Kessler had another terrific game for the winless Cleveland Browns, throwing for 336 yards in a 28-26 loss. If you want to know why I root so hard for Kessler,  check this out.

 Again, a great read…you never disappoint….but Kaepernick is a whiny, average ball player at best, looking for PR. Sorry, no respect for the guy. None, zip, nada. Have we heard from his adopted parents? I'm adopted. He's basically spit in his parents' face, no matter what they say. Deep down, they're really hurt. Once again, we agree to disagree……keep writing. I look forward to your column.

 Thanks for pointing out that article from the Arizona Republic. I thought it was very powerful example of what is at stake in this election. It will be a lot easier to live under President Trump once we don't have abide by that stupid Constitution. I am hoping that under the new overseer of elections needed to prevent the rampant election fraud , Eric Trump, they do away with the 19th Amendment. The country went down hill after that was enacted. 
 I wish there were more people like Colin Kaepernick. It offends me when someone says that a person should not be allowed to make a statement regardless of whether I agree with the sentiment expressed. So a public figure is not allowed to express a viewpoint someone else may not agree and should stick to the sport they play or being an actor or a sportswriter. Heaven forbid they espouse an opinion on a subject that I disagree with. I think I can handle it. I wish I had the same forum to reach the public. 
I have a hard time buying the argument that people are not watching football because of the protests of the national anthem. I think it more likely that there is a lot of awful football games and the quality of play is not very good. Oh look another prime time game with the Houston Texans next week. Can't the NFL go to the flex schedule a little earlier in the season?

 I haven't watched much of SNL in years. I did watch Saturday however. A very funny opener. I don't know if McKinnon will be on there very long. She is supposed to be very funny. I heard she was one of the better things about Ghosbusters. I have a feeling in a couple of years she might be busy making movies. Of course it depends on how long her contract is with SNL. She has been with the show since 2012.

   Wide World of Stuff 
 
 It’s finally Inauguration Day, and the reign of terror and lies has finally ended. A parrot sings Led Zeppelin and it’s fabulous. And a 74-year-old Texas man wanted to play catch with someone, and something magical happened. 
 The NFL championship games are set: It’s Rodgers vs. Brady, and Bills vs. Chiefs. It’s Inauguration week, so I’m thinking of Maya Angelou. And the new Pixar movie “Soul” is very very good. 
 Good News Friday: A father sees his formerly-ill son play pro soccer, fulfilling a dream. A college basketball player hits a game-winning shot, three years after a leukemia diagnosis. And a groom gives his teacher bride an awesome surprise at the altar 
 The man who got drunk and woke up as Celine Dion (seriously). A periodic reminder of how amazing LeBron is, after this incredible 60-foot pass. And Ken Jennings with a lovely tribute to Alex Trebek. 
 Some thoughts on the riot at the U.S. Capitol: Trump must be impeached, and his “brand” may be permanently damaged. A club-level soccer team in England scores a big upset, then belts out an Adele love song. And in the NFL playoffs, the Bills win a thriller, the Ravens get some redemption, and the Browns finally win a playoff game 
 Good News Friday: A police officer pays for a family’s Christmas gifts, instead of arresting them for shoplifting. A high-school student and other kids put together an inspirational song. And a fist-bumping Canadian gets an awesome gift from strangers 
 Georgia on my mind! Both Dems prevail in the Senate runoffs, and we’ve got a Dem-controlled Senate. Yet more proof Bryan Cranston is awesome. And a disgusting display of favoritism, as it relates to vaccine distribution in Tennessee. 
 “The Queen’s Gambit” is as good as everyone has told you it is. Video. Trump, with another impeachable offense phone call over the weekend.And the NFL playoffs are set, and they could be wild. 
 Happy New Year! As 2021 starts, a final look back at the best of Good News Friday: A lawyer in L.A. starts a remarkable running club of homeless men. Two little best friends hug after not seeing each other for three months. And an African-American man, stung by police harassment, saves an officer’s life 
 The best of Good News Friday: The cast of “Hamilton” team up to make a little girl’s dreams come true in an amazing musical number. A wrongly-imprisoned man for 36 years wows on “America’s Got Talent.” And an 11-year-old girl in South Dakota touches hearts of postal workers with her letters.
