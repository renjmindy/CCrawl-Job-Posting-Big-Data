  Does the Job Matter?  
 Work It Daily 
 August 24, 2009 
 Dear Experts, I am an out-of-work reporter who's hitting brick walls when searching for a job in PR/Marketing/Copywriting, but needs a job to help pay the bills in the meantime. I was wondering if it mattered what type of job it is just so long as I end the lengthy unemployment gap I've developed. Should the job be in marketing/sales or something in an office environment? Will potential employers care so long as I have the requirements they're looking for from past work experiences?  Here is how our T.A.P. experts answered this question:   Q#260  While the job matters, it's more important to relate the new experience of any job to help land the job you really want. ( @gradversity )  Q#260  Try to obtain wk. that is related so u maintain ur edge & connection to ur business. ( @DebraWheatman )  Q#260  Agree w/others: accept job/pay bills. Volunteer/freelance on side. Extract applicable duties when updating resume. ( @ValueIntoWords )  Q#260  In today's economy = Pay bills first, worry about how job fits experience for career advancement second. ( @jtodonnell )  Q#260  [1 of 2] Target jobs related 2 ur career goals, skills u want 2 lrn, pay enuf 2 support u as u keep looking... ( @juliaerickson )  Q#260  [2 of 2] ...4 meaningful PR/mktg vol wk try Natl Exec Serv Corps, Taproot Fdn; gr8 networking opps 2. ( @juliaerickson )  Q#260  Keep skills sharp w/volunteer work & cont. ed. in your field. Work where you can to pay bills. ( @dawnbugni )  Q#260  [1 of 2] Employers understand current situation & would rather see that you kept busy than wait for perfect job... ( @louise_fletcher )  Q#260  [2 of 2] ...but do some freelance/unpaid writing - then you can make that the main focus of your resume. ( @louise_fletcher )  Our Twitter Advice Project (T.A.P.) is no longer an active campaign.
