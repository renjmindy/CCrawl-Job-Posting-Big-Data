 Working at Worlée 
 We spend a large proportion of our lives in our workplaces. Worlée believes that this time should be as pleasant and as varied for you as possible. 
 Not just a job like any other 
 With our international partners and customers, we offer you an exciting working environment in which new challenges await you every day. Work together with people from Africa, America, Russia or Asia and develop, sell and produce the raw materials of tomorrow with the most modern technical systems. Whether you are an employee in sales, in production or elsewhere, become a part of the international Worlée team and bring along your ideas for new or existing company processes with you. Help us to improve ourselves every day while we strive to do the same for you in turn. We support our employees by means of numerous training opportunities and provide them with options for further professional and personal development. 
 Health and social issues 
 As a family company, it is important to us that the health of our employees plays a central role along with economic goals. We are always on the lookout for new ways to do something positive for our employees’ health with offerings such as on-site massages and back health courses, subsidized fitness club memberships, varied cafeteria menu selections or health days that include mobility checks. Since 2014, Worlée has offered all of its employees a private supplemental health insurance plan. Included services range from prevention checks to dental insurance to subsidized eyeglasses to treatment by chief physicians, with the extent of coverage depending exclusively on an employee’s number of years of service with the company. Worlée bears all costs for this supplemental insurance, making it a form of coverage that is currently unique in Germany. 
 New Impulses 
 Many of our employees have already been with the company for more than ten years. For the most part, new colleagues come to us from within our own training program, ensuring a constant flow of refreshing original perspectives into our company. However, at times, impulses are needed from outside the company in order to see matters from a new point of view. For this reason, we are always seeking motivated, committed people who share our enthusiasm for the raw materials industry. Join the Worlée team – we look forward to your application. 
 Social Engagement 
 The well-being of our employees is our highest priority. Therefore we offer various social benefits and allowances.
