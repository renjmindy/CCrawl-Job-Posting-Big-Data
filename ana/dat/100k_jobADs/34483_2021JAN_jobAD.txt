 Getting out of this gig is tricky 
 Posted on  September 3, 2019  |  Leave a comment 
 Turns out when you don't finish a gig with this company it takes more than a couple of e-mails to get untangled from the mess. I told them I would continue to honor the NDA because well I didn't get enough information to actually disclose anything from the last one and everything I learned from the earlier ones is already public knowledge for anyone who buys their products that I worked on. But that's not the problem, apparently there was supposed to be some kind of pre-payment made that I never knew about much less received. Everything I got was always after delivery of product. So anywho the company I was doing the gig for says I was supposed to get a pre-payment of half up front, that it seems the company I get gigs through never passed on, and now they want 50% of their pre-pay back as specified in their contract with the company setting up the gigs. Well since I never got the money and all communication went through the company who set up the gigs… you get the point. 
 To reiterate this last gig had so little usable data for me to work with that it was more a translation than a cleanup, only I can't even read the language because I don't have the fonts, even if I was literate in the language. So I'm kicking this back up to the company that sets up these gigs. I don't know what the procedure for this situation is, but I do know this one  Is Not My Fault .
