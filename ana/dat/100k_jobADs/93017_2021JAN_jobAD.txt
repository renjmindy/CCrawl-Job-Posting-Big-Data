 Yes, I am straightforward but with a handful of empathy. I share insights, reflections and hands-on experience. I write about skills, design thinking and random stuff I care about from a designer's perspective. Writing helps me to confront myself with certain topics and create an opinion. It develops my own understanding, clears my mind, organises my thoughts and it is a lot of fun.

 Do we have to become superhumans? 
 It’s almost summer and my time at University will come to an end in a couple of months. It’s time for the job search! I’m excited about that and it made me think a lot about skills that are needed today but also about skills that will be needed in the future.
