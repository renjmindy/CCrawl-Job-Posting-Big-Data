 Craft CMS Developer at Happy Cog REMOTEPERMANENT 
 Job Description 
 (This position is remote friendly, but our main office is in NYC for people that live in the area.) 
 Summary 
 We're Happy Cog (formerly Vector Media Group), a full service interactive agency that works on a wide variety of projects. Lots of those projects are made with Craft: we're an official Craft Service Partner and have built some of the largest and most complex Craft sites out there. We've also been the Craft conference (Dot All) platinum sponsors for 2 years in a row. 
 While we already have a number of Craft developers on our team, we're looking for more. We’re a growing, remote-friendly company of 60 people in Manhattan with great clients (like Google, Airbnb, Twelve South, Etsy, The Associated Press, New York City, St. Regis, Columbia University, and WPP) and an incredible roadmap. 
 We're hiring for multiple skillsets. Whether you're more comfortable writing HTML/JS/CSS and then implementing it in Twig, writing custom Craft plugins that integrate with external APIs, or anything else, we have room for you on the team. And you'll work with other smart developers who can help you grow and challenge you. 
 You’ll be working on 2-3 projects at any time; typically one large application and a few smaller projects to keep things fresh. And you’ll work on the perfect development system: a huge monitor and a new computer of your choice. 
 We offer: 
 
 A creative environment to do the best work of your career. 
 An amazing team of developers, designers, marketers, project managers, and the occasional four-legged office pet. 
 Lunch paid for by the company, every day, via your own Seamless accounts (for on-site employees). 
 Flexible hours. 
 Flexible paid vacation policy. 
 Health, Dental, and Vision insurance. 
 Retirement plan with company matching. 
 Perks and discounts from many stores and services-- cell phone bills, hotels, rental cars, gyms, etc...
