 Workiva Celebrates Pride Month 
 July 7, 2020 
 Jared Hayes 
 The Rainbow employee resource group works to support members of the LGBTQ+ community and allies at Workiva. Throughout the month of June, our group hosted fun and educational opportunities for everyone across the company to (virtually) celebrate Pride. 
 DJ Cardello’s Virtual Family Dance Party 
To kick off our celebration, our resident Workiva DJ, DJ Cardello, put together an after-work virtual dance party. Over 100 Workiva employees and their families spent Friday night dancing to the playlist featuring LGBTQ+ artists. 
 Pride Trivia Event 
The Pride Trivia event aimed to not only entertain, but educate. Employees joined virtual hangouts to answer questions about important dates, advocates and allies throughout LGBTQ+ history. Everyone got the opportunity to learn something new, and the top three contestants won special prizes! 
 Rainbow Scavenger Hunt 
The month closed out with a scavenger hunt that encouraged participants to share their favorite pride photos, dig into the Rainbow group’s page and learning resources, and think about what pride and inclusion means to them. Here are a couple of my favorite responses: 
 
 “Pride is important to me because everyone should feel safe, supported, and loved for being unabashedly themselves! It’s important to normalize (and celebrate) LGBTQ+ families and relationships, break stereotypes, connect, share stories, and inspire our children to be confident and inclusive beings.  ” — Meghan in Scottsdale 
 
 
 “  Pride is a fantastic reminder to everyone that we are a community and that we are not alone. It also shows us how far we have come by reminding us of our history and also reminds us that we have a voice and truly can produce change. Finally, it is a great time of year to focus a little bit less on our daily grind and to be a bit more involved in connecting with others and spreading positivity .” — Rob in Ames 
 
 Although we had to find new and creative ways to celebrate Pride month virtually this year, it didn’t stop us from having fun, connecting with others across the company, and learning something new.
