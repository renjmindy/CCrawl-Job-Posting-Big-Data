                    **career came to naught …**

                       … but I touched  
                       a thousand souls  
                       with a thousand

                       careful words and  
                       a thousand wings  
                       flapped busily to

                       get themselves  
                       somewhere else  
                       on the ancient tree

 career wormhole:  irretrievable / breakdown / of marriage 
giving wormhole:  tong // len 
life wormhole:  great underbelly to the rooftops 
others wormhole:  the silent night of the Batman 
teaching wormhole:  sometimes 
words wormhole:  Dr Strange V – all the words of all the times of all the worlds speak

 whoosh - what a proposition; the thought has been bubbling up for awhile but keeps getting stuck to the side of the glass - I can think of so many reasons why not, but your comment has elbowed me to shake up the glass a little, stop staring at it so much …; thank you
