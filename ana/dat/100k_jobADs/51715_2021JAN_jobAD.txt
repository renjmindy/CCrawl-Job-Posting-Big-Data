  3 Tips On Using Direct Mail In Your Job Search  
 Don Goodman 
 November 20, 2015 
 A majority of the job postings happen online – on job boards, company websites and social media sites like LinkedIn and Twitter, so who would still think to submit a resume via snail mail! Certainly, keeping the resume electronic makes it easier for hiring managers to share with others, but in some instances of the job search, direct mail may help you get noticed even more.

 1. Direct your resume to a person, not a general mail dump off. 
 There are some employers who do not accept resumes via snail mail because they can’t enter it into the Applicant Tracking System (ATS), and that’s why if you’re going to send your resume via postal mail that it should be directed to a specific individual with influence in the hiring decision. Most likely they will give the resume to HR to enter into the ATS but at least they will glance at it you can form a positive impression. Submitting your resume in the mail directly to the people of influence may come at a good time and result in a callback faster. They may indeed need a job candidate like you, but just haven’t had a chance to get around to the job posting yet. You ultimately beat them to the punch! There are also individuals who appreciate a job candidate who takes the extra time to make contact with them in ways other than what’s typical of today’s job seekers. 
 2. Add a hand-written note. 
 A good direct mail trick is to put the resume in a large envelop and put a yellow Post-IT note on the resume saying "Thought you would want to see this." It will certainly attract their attention and get them to scan the resume. This is particularly good for sales and marketing people. 
 3. Time when your mail would arrive. 
 Deciding when you send your mail can impact results of whether it will get noticed. Avoid mail arriving on a Monday because that’s typically the busiest day of the workweek for most folks. Generally, it’ll take 1-2 working days for local mail delivery and 3-4 days for cross-country mail, so time your send-out accordingly so that your resume or thank-you note doesn’t just end up sitting in a pile. Direct mail is not the sole answer to a successful job search, it is an additional step you can take to improve results. Clearly, you want to follow the instructions on how to apply for the job, but when you also have a good lead, consider taking the additional step of direct mail. It can make the difference between an employer taking notice of you and remembering you or not.  This post was originally published at an earlier date.
