 The top five job boards in videogames 
 Posted on  March 14, 2012  |  2 Comments 
 I've been playing some  Rage  recently-mind you,  just a bit -and once you get to Wellspring, the first main hub city, you have the opportunity to pick up sidequests from a job board located next to where everyone is knee-deep in rounds of Tombstones. Which reminded me just how much I love picking up miscellaneous tasks on an open forum. Surely there are others out there, and unfortunately the bulletin board from  Animal Crossing: Wild World  does not really count as it exists only to post  funny,   strange,  and  disturbing  notes about your neighbors… 
 And so, without any further blathering on my part, here's my top five videogame job boards. If I'm to be honest, there's was not much to pick from, at least from my gaming experience. May I continue to find more boards in the future. 
 5. Rage 
 The job board in  Rage  is extremely ho-hum, but it's still something to constantly check in on even if it ultimately doesn't offer a ton of new quests. However, some of the sidequests, when selected, take you directly into the action, which is a nice feature considering the wasteland is a dangerous place for travelers. And yeah, I love just how big it states what it is: JOB BOARD. Otherwise, it's perfunctory at best. 
 4. Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies 
 Sorry about the Japanese screenshot, but couldn't find one in English. Let me explain then. In  Dragon Quest IX  , when inside the Battle Records menu, you can select Quests, which brings you to another menu screen, with two more options available: Normal Quest and Extra Quest. Above these is pictured a bulletin board, with unreadable scraps of paper pinned to it. Oh man, and I just checked, and I still have like  seven pages  of undiscovered extra quests to do. Might have to get back into this one. Such a summer game… 
 3. Dragon Age: Origins 
 Side quests in  Dragon Age: Origins  pop up in a number of ways, and one of them is by visiting a Chanter's Board. I think I found my first one in Lothering, but there's others in Redcliffe Village and the Denerim Market District. Since these tasks are being handed out by the Chantry, most help the already rich and powerful. But they are worth doing as each task provides a monetary reward, and you need money to buy bigger backpack space as soon as you can. Also, love the parchment look of the quests, as well as the "seal of approval" at the bottom of the description page. Nicely done, BioWare. 
 2. Borderlands 
 Okay, okay, technically they call this a Bounty Board, but it all means the same: moar questz. These are scattered throughout Pandora, and when there are new quests to pick up, a giant, floaty exclamation mark stands tall, making sure you know what is what. Turning in a quest and immediately picking up another is a wonderful carrot-on-a-string tactic, and I had more fun leveling up on the side then going through the main story missions in  Borderlands . Most quests found here are given anonymously, but they do offer up experience points, cash, and either a new gun or artifact. They better return in  Borderlands 2  or else… 
 1. Final Fantasy XII 
 When I graduated college and moved to northern New Jersey to get a big-boy job, I went for a few months in a studio apartment without the Internet. Thankfully, I had  Final Fantasy XII  to obsess over. And no, this isn't about hte License Board. Instead, I'm all about the hunts after joining Clan Centurio and becoming best buds with Montblanc. See, in the world of Ivalice, monsters are constantly causing trouble, and so people have to list Marks or Elite Marks on a board in town in hope of help; Vaan and his crew can set out to kill them when and how they please. I can't say for certain without checking my save file how many marks I took down since I last played in, um, 2006, but am pretty sure it was plenty. These mini-bosses were adventures all on their own and made collecting and leveling up a challenge, but so totally worth it.
