 The Power of Giving 
 Dec 5 
 Posted by  Michael Anthony Gagliardi's Blog 
 The Power of Giving 
 
 **** Giving is powerful. Many people will attempt to prevent you from taking, yet no one can stop you from giving as much as you wish. 
 Give and you increase the value that flows through your Life. Give of yourself, and you make yourself stronger. 
 Every time you interact with someone else, you have the opportunity to give that person some kind of value. Whether it is a thing, or a thought, a gesture or a kind word, the most powerful gifts are those that come straight from the heart. 
 Many will appreciate your gifts and some will not, but that is not the point. For it is the sincere act of giving, not how the gift is received, that brings value and goodness to your world. 
 As you give more and more, you have more to give. As the joy of giving flows out from you, new richness fills your life. 
 Each moment is an opportunity to engage the beautiful loving power of giving. Give your best and you'll get even better. 
 ~Ralph Marston~

 Malachi 3:10   Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this,” says the LORD Almighty, “and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that you will not have room enough for it. 
 Praise the Lord! I thank you for your financial support of this ministry online. Every seed that you sow is used to fulfill my mission of sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ. Your giving is very scriptural. Paul stated in Philippians 4:10, 18 (The Living Bible): 
 “How grateful I am and how I praise the Lord that you are helping me again. I know you have always been anxious to send what you could, but for a while you didn’t have the chance.I am generously supplied with the gifts you sent me. They are a sweet-smelling sacrifice that pleases God well.” 
 Jesus promised us in Luke 6:38: 
 “Give and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give unto your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.” 
 Pray over your seed and expect an abundant harvest. Know that your seed is being sown into  good  ground and will be used to teach the Word with simplicity and understanding throughout the world. God bless you for being obedient!

 Are You Really Thankful Or Grateful? A Must Read! 
 Nov 27 
 Posted by  Michael Anthony Gagliardi's Blog 
 The Key to life and having a great one is to have and attitude of gratitude . Are you really thankful and grateful for everything in your life? Do you wake up every morning and go though the day thanking God for everything, no matter what situation you may be in your life's journey here on earth? 
 Gratitude is the best attitude to have each and every moment of the day. 
 It says to our Heavenly Father that we are humble not selfless and it reverences Him and show Him, you know you are nothing with out Him. When your child is so thankful and grateful to you no matter what. It makes you want to do more for them right? That is the same way God works. The difference is, He can do so much more than we can do and He loves us more than we could ever love. Think about that for a moment. The creator of the universe, the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, Our Father and Savior loved us so much that He gave His only begotten Son that who so ever believe in Him would not perish but Have ever lasting Life in paradise in Heaven. That alone should make you jump for joy each and everyday. 
 John 3:16   (KJV)  _ 16For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life._ 
 Start being Thankful and Grateful for everything and see what happens to your attitude and the many more blessing you will have in your life. God love us and wants the best for all of His Children. There is nothing that God can't do if we ask, believe and be thankful. He is pure and Holy and is a Man of His word and is the same yesterday, today and forever. 
 Hebrews 13:8   Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. 
 3 John 2 (KJV)   “Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.” 
 Mark 9:23   “‘If you can’?” said Jesus. “Everything is possible for him who believes.” 
 Ephesians 5:20   always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.   Philippians 4:19   And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus. 
 Lord, I'm so thankful and grateful for everything in my life. I give you the highest Praise and Glory for being such a Graceful and Merciful God. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you Lord for all of your wonderful blessing in my life. In Jesus mighty name, Amen. 
 
 **So what are you so thankful and grateful today and each and everyday for? Let God know Now!

 Beware Of False Prophets Claiming To Be Jesus. They Are Out There.

 The words of God are true whether you believe are not. God's words never change and He will not deviate from it He is pure and Holy. He is the same yesterday, today and forever. The world is constantly trying to make God's living words conform to what they feel is right instead of totally relying on the Holy Spirit to guide them in the real and only truth (the living words of God). 
 Here is one guy of many more that could deceive you if you don't truly know the living words of God. Don't be fooled! 
 Matthew 24-4-8 
 New International Version (NIV) 
 4 __ Jesus answered: “Watch out that no one deceives you. 5 For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and will deceive many. 6 You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. 7 Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 8 All these are the beginning of birth pains. 
 All you are seeing is prophecies being for filled before Christ Returns. Remember Don't be fooled, know the words of God!

 Angels and Demons. Are They Real? You Better Believe It! 
 Oct 17 
 Posted by  Michael Anthony Gagliardi's Blog 
 Psalm 91:11 
 For he will command his  angels  concerning you to guard you in all your ways; 
 Just because you cannot see angels or demons in the physical world does not mean there not there or not real. You can't see natural gas, but if you lite a match when it's present and see what happens, ca-boooom. The invisible world or spirit world is more real than you think and everyone will see it one day some sooner than others. So with that said, You need to prepare yourself and your family with knowledge and understanding of the real and only truth ( the living words of God). You Can't assume that you know and understand the truth, You Got to know it! and understand it!, So you will prevail in every situation you may come across in your life journey here on earth , until you enter the kingdom of Heaven. 
 The best thing you can do to conquer this is found in  Ephesians 6:10-18   10Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. 11Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand 
 against the devil 's schemes. 12For our struggle is not against flesh and 
 blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of 
 this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly 
 realms. 13Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of 
 evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done 
 everything, to stand. 14Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around 
 your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, 15and with your 
 feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. 16In 
 addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can 
 extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 17Take the helmet of 
 salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. 18And pray 
 in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With 
 this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints. 
 
 Now who side are you on? Pick one and don 't waiver. 
 
 As For Me I Choose The Lord Who Already Conquer Death Hell And The Grave And Broke The Curse Of Satan At The Cross Of Calvary. The Victory Is Ours In Christ Jesus! Give Him Praise and Ask Him To Come Into Your Heart As Your Lord And Savior And Wipe Away All Your Sins White As Snow. Amen!

 God The Great Deliverer 
 Sep 3 
 Posted by  Michael Anthony Gagliardi's Blog 
 Have you ever felt that life had no meaning anymore? I did 
Have you ever lost your home due to forclosure? I did 
Have you ever lost a job? I did 
Have you ever lost a parent? I did 
Have you ever went through a divorce or separation? I did 
Have you ever wondered what your purpose of life was? I did 
Have you ever be betrayed so bad that it hurt so much? I did 
Have you ever went to jail? I did 
Have you ever had no money to eat? I did 
 
Well Its ok, We serve a mighty awesome God who understands and will deliver you in any situation your in or feeling anywhere or anytime. The God of the universe is alot bigger than any situation your going through. All things are possible if you believe! His words are true and you can trust and rely on Him 100% ever time. 
 Remember the living words of God in the Bible, in the book of Isaiah 
41:10 declares that, God’s people do not need to be afraid of anything, 
because He is ultimately in control of all things. Whether it’s a minor life 
setback or a seriously frightening situation, Christians are called to face it 
without undue fear, trusting in God. 
 The living words of God in the Bible, in the book of Psalm 
34:19 declares that, A righteous man may have many troubles, but the 
LORD delivers him from them all; 
 Do you notice in the above scripture that there is no period after many 
troubles, however there is a comma then the word but? This means, this is 
not the end, but the beginning of God becoming the Great Interrupter, to 
cancel out the first part of our many troubles and then delivering us from 
them all. How awesome that God interrupts, to deliver us from all of our 
many troubles we go through in life. 
 Whatever many afflictions or troubles you might be going through, like 
worry, fear, doubt, anxiety, financially difficulties, sickness, disease, 
suicidal thoughts, depression, separation or divorce and more. God will 
always interrupt or butt in to deliver us from them all. Remember the living 
words of God in the Bible, in the book of Psalm 34:19 declares that, no 
matter how many troubles come our way, God said, He will deliver us from 
them all, as long as you are righteous in His eyes. 
 Give Him Amazing Praise!

 Christian News! Roaring Hungry Lion Loose In Your Area! No Joke! 
 Aug 29 
 Posted by  Michael Anthony Gagliardi's Blog 
 The living words of God in the Bible, in the book of  1 Peter 5:8-9  declares that, Be selfcontrolled  and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. 9 Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kind of sufferings. 
 
 These are not just physical attacks on you ,but mental and spiritual attacks and you must be ready at all times to defend yourself or you will be eated up by satan and his evil tricks. He knows his time is up and he is defeated by Jesus at the cross of Calvary, so he is on a rampage to devour the weak before the rapture and the second coming of Christ Jesus. 
 I’m sure I don’t want to be lost in a forest with a hungry lion looking to devour me. What about you? I hope you said no. Remember, the devil has no authority over you and cannot hurt you, unless you allow him. That’s why he tries so hard, to keep you from knowing, trusting and having the faith to believe in the only real truth (the living words of God). Satan knows that the more you meditate on God’s living words, the more you will trust and have faith to believe in God’s living words. Satan then knows he will have no power or authority to harm you. He then becomes like a little kitty cat. 
 Now if you think God’s living words are only words, then why do you think Satan is always trying to keep you so far away from them? By distorting them, confusing you and lying to you? Satan is smarter than you think. Remember, he was an angel of the Lord. Satan is described more than anything else, as a liar. He has no power to defeat God, but he is skilled at lying and convincing people to listen to his lies. Anyone who lies is modeling their behavior on the devil. Satan is a murderer and the father of lies. Satan means “adversary.” Satan is the enemy of God. He wants to destroy everything God has created. He is also called  “the devil  ” (James 4:7),  “the evil one”  (1 John 5:18-19),  “the prince of this world  ” (John 14:30) and  “the god of this age”   (2 Corinthians 4:4).  Satan brought evil into the world. In this next verse  (John 8:44)  Jesus tells us that there is no truth in the devil, and even goes so far as to say that lying is the devil’s native language and that he is the father of lies  John 8:44   You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father’s desire. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies. 
 What is the Solution? You Must Put On The Full Amour Of God. This is no Joke! 
 
 2 Timothy 3:1-5  1   But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. 2 People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, 3 without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, 4 treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God 5 having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with them. 
 2 Peter 3:3-7  3  _First of all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires. 4 They will say, "Where is this 'coming' he promised? Ever since our fathers died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation." 5 But they deliberately forget that long ago by God's word the heavens existed and the earth was formed out of water and by water. 6 By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed. 7 By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the Day of Judgment and destruction of ungodly men. Also God’s living words in the Bible, in the book of Ephesians 6:6-18, declare that, in those end days of evil doings, we should be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power, by putting on the full armor of God, so that we can take our stand against the devil’s schemes. God also declares that, we are not fighting against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, authorities, powers of the dark world and the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. By putting on the full armor of God, the living words of God declares that, we should pray in the spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. And with this in mind, we must be alert and always keep praying for all the saints. Pray and continuously pray. _ 
 Ephesians 6:10-18  _ 10 Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. 11 Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes. 12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. 13 Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. 14 Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place,15 and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. 16 In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 17 Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.18 And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints._

 Satan, You Can't Touch This! 
 Aug 23 
 Posted by  Michael Anthony Gagliardi's Blog 
 Jesus had such a relentless loving passion at the cross of calvary to conquer Satan death, hell and the grave which broke the curse, so we can live a victorious life here on earth, until we go to Heaven. Give Him a mighty shout Praise.  Satan is Finished  and he knows his time is short, so don't give him an inch, because he also has a relentless passion, but of hate to try and destroy everything God has created.  The Victory is ours in Christ Jesus !! 
 Revelation 1:8   “ I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.” 
 Galatians 3:13   Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole.” 
 Revelation 22:3   No longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his servants will serve him. 
 Isaiah 54:17   (Amplified Bible)   But no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper 
 __ 1 John 4:4 (KJV)   Greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. 
 Philippians 4:13   (KJV)   I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. 
 Romans 8:31   If God is for us, who can be against us? 
 Ephesians 6:10-18   10 Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. 11Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes. 12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. 13 Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. 14 Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, 15 and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. 16 In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 17 Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. 18 And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.

 Malachi 3:10   Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this,” says the LORD Almighty, “and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that you will not have room enough for it.

 "Sticks and Stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me." Big Big Lie 
 Jul 19 
 Posted by  Michael Anthony Gagliardi's Blog 
 Proverbs 18:21  The tongue has the power of **  life ** and  death  and those who love it will eat its fruit. 
 
 Deuteronomy 30:19  This day I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you that I have set before you  life  and  death  ,  blessings  and  curses  Now  choose life  , so that you and your children may live. 
 Now if you really think about it, God has given us some awesome authority by our words we speak, if we choose wisely. God even tells us which words to choose. How much easier can it get? It can’t. However, in this law God has given us, it doesn’t matter if you’re a believer or not. This law is like the law of gravity. Whether you are a believer in Christ or not, the law of gravity is still there. For example: Let’s say you accidently fell off a ladder. You’re going to hit the ground, whether you believe in God or not. So be very careful of the words coming out of your mouth, because you are either activating the law of life and blessings or of death and curses.  This is no joking matter. 
 Matthew 18 (KJV)  Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. 
 Jesus is very clear in the Bible that our mouths (words) are very powerful, so with that said, are you watching what you are saying all the time?

 Faith Comes By Hearing The Word Of God. 
 Jul 4 
 Posted by  Michael Anthony Gagliardi's Blog 
 Remember, In The Beginning Was The Word And The Word Was With God And The Was God.  God words are living words from the beginning, now and to the end, so why are you not listening? 
 Romans 10:17 (KJV)   “So then faith cometh by hearing, and   hearing by the word of God.” 
 Hebrews 11:1(KJV  )   Now faith is the substance of things 
 hoped for, the evidence of things not seen 
 So how can you truly hope for anything without having faith in God that it will comes to pass? You Can't! Your wasting you time and energy on something that won't happen. 
 Jesus is very clear that without faith it is impossible to please God. 
 Hebrews 11:6   And without faith it is impossible to please 
 God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he 
 exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him. 
 Mark 9:23   “‘If you can’?” said Jesus. “Everything is 
 possible for him who believes.” 
 Matthew 25:23   His master replied, 'Well done, good and 
 faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will 
 put you in charge of many things. Come and share your 
 master 's happiness!' 
 Hebrews 10:23   Let us hold fast the profession of our faith 
 without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;) 
 John 15:7   If you remain in me and my words remain in you, 
 ask whatever you wish, and it will be given you. 
 1 Timothy 6:12   Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of 
 the eternal life to which you were called when you made your 
 good confession in the presence of many witnesses 
 After the end of each day can you say to yourself " I have fought the good fight of faith. I will finish the race to the end .  2 Timothy 4:7   I have fought the good fight, I have finished   he race, I have kept the faith.
