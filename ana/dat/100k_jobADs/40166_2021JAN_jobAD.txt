 React-Native App Dev for android and Ios, already partially done 
 Published: Last year  Bids: 3 
 We have developed a web-app and we would like to create a mobile app that will allow users to access their data and have certain functions as they do in the web version but on their mobile device. 
 The project was already begun using react-native, but it is incomplete. We only have the basics such as login and a navigation, but we need to implement more parts of the design to display data and have functions within the app. 
 The backend is already built and can be accesed through REST and a json web token as our auth. No backend is required, just the headless application. 
We expect some local storage of data to prevent a lot of data usage from constant fetches, those specifics will be explained with the design. We would like to reach the minimum requirements for practical usability and in time perhaps integrate further functionality that is available in the web version.
