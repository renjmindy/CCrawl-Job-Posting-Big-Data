 Implementation Project Manager 
 Interim - Outside of IR35 
 North Birmingham - 6 months 
 £450 per day - start date ASAP 
 My client, a FTSE 250 retail business, is undergoing a major transformation programme at the moment and as part of this transformation they have designed a new operational TOM (target operating model) to be implemented at branch level. 
 The incumbent of this role will be tasked to project manage the successful delivery of the implementation of this new TOM to restructure current operations for better utilisation of existing resources. You will develop a detailed implementation plan and then manage the plan at task level ensuring all tasks are complete on time and to the required standard by the people responsible. 
 Day to day you will also be managing risk, issues, budgets whilst updating the RAID logs and registers, keeping abreast of developments, potential stumbling blocks and managing appropriately. 
 There is a huge amount of change with the new TOM involving elements of people change, process change, location change and technology change and it will be the responsibility of this Project Manager to make sure all training materials are in place to cover the change of job specifications and functionality at branch level whilst keeping on top of the timings of all the varying elements of change and that they will be delivered on schedule. 
 This is a highly complex change programme with many stakeholders involved to deliver the successful new model. which such wholesale change being made to the operational activity of the workforce, this is a key project role that needs to be delivered. 
 I must stress that this is not an IT role and IT project managers will not be considered. This role will suit a project manager who has experience of implementing target operation models at operational level involving people and process change across a multi site business. 
 My client is offering an initial 6 month contract; the role has been assessed and it will fall OUTSIDE of IR35. 
 Please don't hesitate to apply for the role or send your CV
