 Unemployment pushes more men to take on female-dominated jobs 
 Posted November 8th, 2019 
   
 Unemployment pushes more men to take on female-dominated jobs 
 In the last few decades, many high-paying jobs that are mostly done by men – like manufacturing – have  contracted or disappeared . At the same time, many jobs in fields dominated by women – like education and health care – have significantly increased. 
 In fact, female-dominated jobs have some of the  highest projected job  and  wage growth  in the economy. 
 We are   sociologists  interested in the following question: If jobs in female-dominated sectors represent the future, what will it take for men to take them? 
 Who’s working where? 
 Women have  made significant progress  entering male-dominated jobs – like  finance ,  law  and  medicine  – over the past several decades. 
 However, men have made far less progress entering female-dominated jobs like those of teachers, nurses or human resource representatives, among others. 
 Men have largely avoided female-dominated work for two key reasons. First, men  may face social stigma  by entering jobs that challenge masculine ideals that they distance themselves from feminine activities. 
 Second, female-dominated jobs tend to  pay less  than male-dominated ones, even when skill levels and education requirements are equivalent. 
 However, not all female-dominated jobs pay poorly. Jobs like nursing can offer high wages, good benefits and job stability. Yet even in this field, men remain a  small minority  at about 13%. 
 Prior research shows that  few men aspire  to work in female-dominated jobs, but we wondered what men who lose their jobs and become unemployed will do? Would they consider female-dominated work then? 
 It’s more than just an academic question because many men – particularly working-class men –  may face unemployment  at some point in their careers. 
 Our  recent study  shows that men who are unemployed are much more likely to switch to a female-dominated job. And when they do, some men experience job advantages. 
 
 Wage and prestige bumps 
 Men who enter  female-dominated jobs  experience, on average, a 4% wage increase and significant boosts to the prestige of their job relative to their previous job before unemployment. 
 In contrast, men who entered male-dominated jobs or jobs that had an equal balance of men and women either maintained or lost ground in wages and occupational prestige. Examples of mixed-gender jobs include claims adjusters, property managers and retail salespersons. 
 Our study suggests that female-dominated jobs may help mitigate common  scarring effects  of lost wages or prestige in a man’s subsequent job after being unemployed. 
 If female-dominated jobs tend to pay less than comparable male-dominated jobs, what explains these job advantages? We suspect that some men may be willing to take a female-dominated job only if it offers higher wages or more occupational prestige. Thus, they may specifically target upgraded jobs in these cases. 
 Employers may also more  highly value  men’s previous occupational backgrounds in male-dominated or mixed-gender fields, allowing them access to higher level jobs than in other sectors. 
 Notably, there may be future benefits of entering female-dominated jobs, like stepping onto a “glass escalator.”  Research  on men in nontraditional fields have found that straight, white men are often fast-tracked to management positions, akin to riding an invisible – but very real – escalator up to the top. 
 These processes, of course, starkly contrast the  glass ceiling  that many women face in which they experience barriers in rising to leadership and contribute to gender inequality within female-dominated domains. 
 However, these advantages accrue in female-dominated jobs only if men stay in them, and compelling  research  by sociologist Margarita Torre casts doubts that men will stay in these jobs for a long time. 
 Torre’s work shows that many men use female-dominated jobs as a stopgap position before moving back into a male-dominated or mixed-gender job. 
 
 Men in female-dominated jobs 
 Having men doing “women’s work” may not just affect their careers. It could impact society as well. 
 Jobs associated with women are economically  devalued  in the American economy, particularly  when they involve care work , such as teaching, child care and health care. 
 Although we contend that female-dominated jobs merit  better wages  regardless of men’s entrance, men’s participation in these jobs may enhance the job’s status and economic value. Indeed, research has shown that  wages tend to increase  after men enter jobs dominated by women, potentially because employers may more highly value the work that men do or more readily accept men’s negotiations for higher wages. 
 Men’s entrance into female-dominated jobs could also help reduce potential labor market shortages,  like those expected in health care . Depending on the job, such position may provide men with greater job stability and employment  opportunities , given the high projected  job growth  of many female-dominated jobs. 
 Moreover, men’s entrance into female-dominated jobs may push along what we, and many other scholars, see as a needed shift in  how the culture values  work traditionally done by women. If female-dominated jobs were as highly valued as comparable male-dominated jobs, the incomes of women in these positions – and thus women’s broader economic status – would  increase . 
 Our research shows that economic conditions are strongly associated with men’s entrance into female-dominated work. The challenge is getting past the point that men in the workforce need an economic shock like unemployment to consider female-dominated jobs. 
 Raising wages in female-dominated jobs and removing stigmas associated with men doing them would go a long way in advancing men’s integration into these jobs and reducing gender inequality in the workforce.
