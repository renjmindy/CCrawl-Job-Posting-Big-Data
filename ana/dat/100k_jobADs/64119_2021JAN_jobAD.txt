 Hello. 
A recruiter asked a job seeker this question: What are your expectations from this company? 
He answered that he wanted to gain new experience, to develop, as well as to get a satisfying pay. 
 The job seeker meant "to develop professionally." I think that the word "professionally" is obvious in that context and can be omitted. Am I correct?

 No. (And the sentence is not idiomatic and has an error.)

 There are several ways to develop – I would definitely leave it in.
