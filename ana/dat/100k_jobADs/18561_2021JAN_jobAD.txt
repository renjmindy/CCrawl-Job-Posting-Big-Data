 Earn It!: Know Your Value and Grow Your Career, in Your 20s and Beyond Book Review 
 Life would be easy if it came with an instruction manual. But it doesn't and that forces us to unfortunately learn as we go. 
 Earn It!: Know Your Value and Grow Your Career, in your 20s and Beyond  was published earlier this year. Written by television journalist  Mika Brzezinski  and producer  Daniela Pierre Bravo , this book is the guidebook I wish when I was in my 20's. Using the personal experience of the authors and the experience of other successful women, the reader is guided through every step in the early stages of their career. 
 While I was reading this book, I kept thinking back to my 20's and the career mistakes that I made back then. This book is the perfect book for the young person in their 20's (young women especially) who are starting their careers and need a helping hand. It is part guidebook, part cheerleader and part fire lighting under the proverbial behind of the reader. 
 If I had to choose one aspect of the book that stood out, I would say though the advice is aimed at twenty somethings, some of it can be applied long after we have aged out of our 20's. 
 I recommend it.

 This hobby blog is dedicated to movie nerdom, nostalgia, and the occasional escape. In the late 90s, I worked at Blockbuster Video where they let me take home two free movies a day. I caught up on the classics and wrote movie reviews for Denver 'burbs newspapers and magazines. Today, I continue to revisit the old and discover the new on the screen. Comments and dialogue are highly encouraged. This year, I'm excited to collaborate with other writers via SLICETHELIFE in which we will share our movie genre favorites in our 2021 Movie Draft!
