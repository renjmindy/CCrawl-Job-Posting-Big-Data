 About Firstbase.io 
 Join Firstbase.io to help more founders start companies 
 About the role 
 Firstbase.io is looking for a Head of Sales and Business Development to join our fully-remote, international team. 
 Firstbase.io is a VC-backed tech startup (YCW21 batch) dedicated to promoting business in the worldwide economy. We are helping founders launch in the US and access the greatest startup ecosystem on the planet. 
 You should enjoy being both a player and a coach within the sales process at Firstbase.io. You should obsess over delivering the best customer experience to a global market that expects simplicity and clarity. Currently, we sell a transactional product with a sales cycle that often doesn’t exceed seven days, so you should understand how to build value at scale and quickly, while maintaining a personalized, relationship-focused approach. 
 As a coach, you will manage the inbound sales team members who currently support founders across more than 140 countries. As a player, you will manage and grow your own pipeline with our current partners (including Google, AWS, Gusto, and 40+ others) and develop new opportunities with a new channel and affiliate partners. 
 What we are looking for: 
 
 Self-driven and proactive nature 
 Understanding of the transactional sales model 
 Experience both as a player and coach within a sales organization 
 Creative, yet approachable both in communication and writing skills 
 Highly organized and able to multitask 
 Knowledge of startups, specifically in B2B SaaS space 
 Ability to work within the unknown while staying productive 
 Customer-focused, customer-centric, customer-obsessed 
 
 Note from the CEO: “It is the fuel of our growth. One of the first full-time hires at Firstbase.io was a Head of BD. The person we hired, Danny, has turned out to be a perfect fit for the role. He is now our COO, so we are looking for someone to take over his old responsibilities and some new ones — to help us sell to and partner with amazing companies.”
