 Ms. Razo, 
 To apply for the said UAE caregiver jobs, just visit the agency involved through their office address that I have provided in the jobs post where you posted your comment. You can also contact the said agency through their phone number which I've also provided in the same jobs post. But be sure to confirm with the agency first if the job order for the said UAE caregiver jobs is stil active or not.
