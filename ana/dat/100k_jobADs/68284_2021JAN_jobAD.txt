  Win Career Prizes From Us On Twitter!  
 Work It Daily 
 March 10, 2009 
 By J.T. O'Donnell I was just in the middle of planning a contest for our site and was thinking, "Wow, I wish I could hold a contest on Twitter." And then of course, the leading authority on all things social media related ,  Mashable.com , sent me information about Twittaways.com - a way for me to pick random winners from Twitter followers who enter my contest.  So, here's how it's going to work:  1) I'll post on Twitter the item we are giving away in the morning. 2) Followers RT the message to all their followers which automatically enters them to win. 3) We'll pick the winner at 8PM EST that night and post it. It's that easy!  What's up for grabs?  Well, to start, I'll be giving away  free private hour-long career consult by phone ($130 value) . I'll look at your resume, discuss your career situation, and help you with your gameplan to increase your chances of getting interviews and offers. But I'm hoping the word will catch on and some others will donate items to be given away. So, if you have or know someone who has something to donate - let me know! And of course, if you have any questions (or want to donate an item), e-mail us at  twitter@workitdaily.com .
