 Mark and Denise Duffield-Thomas at Ballinacurra House, Kinsale 
 Celebrities and international media gathered at Ballinacurra House, Kinsale, where Mark and Denise Duffield-Thomas from the UK and Australia, were chosen the Top couple for the Ultimate Job in Ireland – and probably the world! After a weekend of challenges and beating stiff competition, Mark and Denise Duffield-Thomas have landed the Ultimate dream job: 6 months of luxury travel around the globe for Irish wedding and honeymoon company Runaway Bride and Groom.com. 
 The Top 10 candidates came from Australia, US, Canada, South Africa, 
 Brazil, UK, Galway, Wexford, Sligo, Dublin and Cork to enjoy a full Kinsale dining and leisure experience at some of Kinsale’s top class restaurants, clubs and venues, such as Blue Haven, Hamlets Bar, White Lady Nightclub, Trident Hotel and Carlton Hotel. 
 Organised by RunAwayBrideandGroom.com, the Ultimate Job in Ireland – and probably the world! received 30,000 applications from over 90 countries and global media attention since launching on 19th February. 
 “It has been an amazing weekend for all people involved. Kinsale has been the Ultimate host town for the Top 10 couples and the judges,” says Runaway Bride and Groom managing director Rosemarie Meleady, also one of the judges. “The Top 10 have all worked incredibly hard not just to get to the final but also throughout this weekend, with all the tasks we have given them. Given the amount of talent displayed by all the contestants, the decision was a very difficult one but we are happy with the final result. We really hope to keep in touch with all the couples and we wish them the very best.” 
 Denise and Mark will immediately start preparing for their first trip after the announcement and will fly out at the end of May to Zanzibar, Mauritius and private escorted safari in Kenya – a week in each destination – just for starters. 
 “We have had the most amazing weekend in Kinsale and we hope to make you all proud as ambassadors for Ireland around the globe in the next six months,” they said.

 Don't have a video camera? - Still apply for Ultimate Job! 
 I got a query from someone who wants to apply for the Ultimate Job in Ireland by  http://www.runawaybrideandgroom.com  but they don't have a video camera so this is what I suggested: 
 Most cameras and phones now have a video recording facility on them. I would recommend asking around your family and friends to see if they have a digital camera you can use. There are free video editing facilities on most computers now too so even a series of photos with a voice over could be very effective. Or even a series of drawings scanned in and pieced together as a video. Recruit your friends and family to help!
