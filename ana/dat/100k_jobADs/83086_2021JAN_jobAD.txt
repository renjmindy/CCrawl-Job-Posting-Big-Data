 What defines success? It's a good question. So many see it as money/sales and fame. While I am really happy that my artwork sells, it isn't the biggest part of how I define my accomplishments. It's actually quite smallâ€¦ 
 I thought today would be a good day to remind ourselves of all of the "good" in our lives and what truly makes us a success. It's a simple little exercise that might take some thought, but surely success can be found in even the smallest of thingsâ€¦ 
 Pick one or more ways you are successful and leave a comment. I would love to hear from you! 
 I will go firstâ€¦ 
 I am a success because: in my life, the people around me have always underestimated me. When they said "you can't do it", I always did. Whether it was mucking horse stalls in Florida's Summer heat, defeating cancer naturally 15 years ago or selling my art and earning a living with it. When they said "no way". I've done it!

 The other day someone asked me if I would lower the price of one of my custom paintings. She said that she knew it was a "labor of love" so she would understand if I wouldn't. I didn't. It isn't because I am greedy about my "love". It's actually due to the fact that creating art is a "labor of expense". 
 A lot of people do not realize what goes into that painting you hang on your wall. Aside from a lifetime expenses like education, I am talking about the day to day. We have to pay for our inventory such as canvas, frames, mats, texture mediums, varnish, brushes and paint, but we also have to use a ton of electricity and water. We buy paper towels by the pallet. My studio requires plastic sheeting, special flooring, butcher's paper to cover my table. I constantly need to purchase equipment and supplies such as tables, chairs, printers, scanners, printer ink, paper, pens, pencils, staplers, calculators, spray bottles, shelving, computers, cameras, containers, lighting, gloves and a special ventilation system (so I do not breath in toxic fumes all day). And when one of those breaks or runs out, I have to call an expert to come fix it or I have to buy a replacement. 
 And then there is the "F" word: Fees. We pay listing fees whether a piece sells or not, marketing fees such as CPC, yearly fees for art sites, fees when we sell a piece and fees to receive payment like PayPal and Credit Cards. Social media are starting to charge fees if you want to be seen too. There are so many fees that sometimes you just feel "F"d. 
 Very few artists get rich on their work alone. Yes, there are famous success stories that we can all fantasize about, but for the average creative, the best you can hope for is to make some sales now and again. If you are really fortunate, it might get to be your only job. But that is even more rare. Sharing household expenses with my husband has allowed me to make this my full-time career. But a lot of my artists friends work regular day jobs and create on the side. That is typical. It's just ridiculously expensive to produce artwork and the income gained is too low in comparison. 
 Everyone feels the sting of inflation and artists are no different. 
 My hope is that this blog comes across as"informational" and doesn't just sound like a rant. I rarely get on a soapbox because I am too busy working. ðŸ™‚ Maybe, when someone that is not into creating art reads this, they will gain a new appreciation for our labor and expenseâ€¦Just maybeâ€¦

 It can be difficult to find balance in your life when you have so many demands pulling you in different directions. Family, friends, work, health, etc. all need a place. I create and list a lot of work and many have asked me things like "Do you sleep?" I get 8 hours a night. I also market my work heavily and some have wondered how on earth I do it. With experience, I have become extremely efficient at marketing. I am also pretty handy with the camera and scanner. I do most things quicklyâ€¦.I always have. Patience is not one of my virtues! I not only run a thriving successful art business, I also grow an organic garden, care for my daughter, care for animals and cook/prepare 95% of my own meals (Celiac). I shop for my family, clean house and exercise every single day. I go to dinner parties, family gatherings and art shows. I play Scrabble. I do not have extra hours in the day. I am just big on balance and scheduling. I do not allow myself to get distracted in web surfing or reading endless posts on Facebook. I stay focused. I have time slots for my work and I stick to them. This ensures I have time for what is important in life. I eat on a schedule too. By keeping all that I do in priority when I am working on them or experiencing them, I never run out of time. If I am at the park with my family, that is what I am doing and thinking aboutâ€¦.not work. If I am working, that is my focus. Some things you cannot help coming into your life to throw you off, but I have found that MOST of what keeps us from using our time wisely is useless. How many cat memes have your read? How many political posts? Farmville? Tweets about what you had for lunch? Do you sit on the toilet and get lost in a magazine? Do you watch T.V.? I don't. That is how I do itâ€¦I do not waste time, so that I have plenty of it for everything I want in life!
