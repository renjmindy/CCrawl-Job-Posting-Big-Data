 Seeking Work at the Puget Sound Navy Yard - Bremerton…1940 
 Posted on  December 3, 2015  by  BJ MacDonald 
 Keith must have been checking around for potential work in 1940 because he received a letter from the Labor Board of the Puget Sound Navy Yard in Bremerton, Washington on 29 August, 1940. They wrote back that they had no …  Continue reading ->

 Things to Ponder! 
 
 
 The header photo is of the Glen on the peninsula of Knoydart, in the Highlands of Scotland, I was feeling a little nostalgic for my tour of the Penninsula in May 2018. This is very remote and there are actually ruins in the distance. It must have been a hard life. 
 About April of 2020 I will be removing the posts I published on this blog regarding my Trip to Canada in September of 2014. They will be turned into a PDF and a PDF of a Table of Contents will also be available to aid you in finding information. I suggest that you go and study the posts for the trip in Sept 2014 and print out any you are interested in. If you want to check out the PDF's of the trip seek out the page in the drop down menus at the top of this blog titled Trips to Canada 2012 and 2014. 
 
 
 Sad Announcement 
 
 
 It was great sadness that I tell you that John Miles Flynn, husband of my cousin Ruth McDonald Flynn died peacefully at his home in Carmel November 4, 2020. John was 101 years old. His wife Ruth was the daughter of Robert and Catherine McDonald. Robert was a son of Duncan and Elizabeth (Sauve) McDonell. I had the privilege of meeting John and Ruth in 2009 in Carmel and they were very kind and friendly. This was my first time. I again had the privilege of visiting them again in 2011 to attend their Jubilee Ceremony and their daughter Mother Teresita of the Carmelite Monastery in Carmel. John's obituary in online at the Monterey Herald. Sleep in peace John and thanks for your kindness toward me. You can read about Duncan and Elizabeth on this blog The Man Who Lived Airplanes.

 IMPORTANT: St. Alphonse Cemetery Maybe In Jeopardy 
 
 
 As of 9/17/2018 I have been informed that the St. Alphonse Cemetery in Chapeau maybe in jeopardy of being destroyed. I tried to photography many photos and put them on Find A Grave, I also made sure that the two cemeteries were separately done. I am talking about the one in Chapeau next to the Catholic Church, not the one 1/2 mile south of the town. 
 I do not live in the area of the church and cemetery and can't get more photos done. We need help getting that cemetery documented with photos. E. Brown did the book years ago on the burials and stones but we need help now. 
 If you can please submit photos to me and information and I will see that it is uploaded or join Find A Grave it takes a small amount of time to learn it but it is worth it. 
 I will keep and eye on things and let you know if things change.
