 What should I do with my life? (in brackets) 
 March 14, 2017 Eileen Kohan   Leave a comment 
 The new president has declined to participate in March Madness this year. No filling in blank spaces to arrive at a prediction of the men's NCAA basketball champion. Maybe he's just looking at it the wrong way. 'Bracketology' is simply a means to eliminate options to arrive at the best decision. 
 Completing a NCAA bracket is the perfect 'trial run' for the other major decision we face - what should I do with my life? 
 With a little imagination, you can use the bracket concept as a decision matrix to manage career choice, job search or your network. 
 In 2007, sportswriters  Richard Sandomir  and  Mark Reiter  published  ‘The Enlightened Bracketologist: The Final Four of Everything’ , applying the methodology of March Madness to everyday decisions. 
 “Bracketology—the practice of parsing people, places, and things into discrete one-on-one matchups to determine which of the two is superior or preferable—works because it is simple. It is a system that helps us make clearer and cleaner decisions about what is good, better, best in our world. What could be simpler than breaking down a choice into either/or, black or white, this one or that one?” 
 How can we apply the scaffolding of March Madness to job search? Let’s say you are totally undecided (confused, terrified, ambivalent) about your next career move. All you know is you’re not happy with your current work situation. Where do you begin? 
 Try categorizing your interests using the bracket system. Instead of four regions, fill in four career fields that might interest you. Next, identify sixteen possible employers in each field. Once you have your potential employer roster identified, begin your research. 
 This may be a good time to develop a parallel list of contacts: a bracket representing your network. Use the same four career categories and identify folks who have broad expertise in the profession. In this ‘exploration’ phase you are aggregating data about industry trends, market leaders, and potential for growth. 
 As you progress with your data gathering, you will begin to eliminate some organizations in favor of others. Once you get to your ‘elite eight’ employers, schedule your in-depth information interviews. 
 As you talk to people you will begin to establish a realistic assessment of ‘organization fit’, and evaluate your chances for success. 
 The ‘elite eight’ forms your target list. By the time you have narrowed your selection to eight, you should feel comfortable that each employer presents a realistic starting point in the next phase your career. 
 As with any selection process, you don’t have total control. The employer extends the offer and you have the choice to accept or continue to pursue other options. 
 The NCAA tournament lasts three weeks. If you start filling in your career brackets now, you will advance through the exploration process at a pace to be ready for interviews by ‘tip-off’ in the championship game. 
 Its time to add a little ‘March Madness’ to your job search, and some fun to a typically stressful routine.

 What are you going to do with those energy reserves you stored this summer? 
 September 1, 2016 Eileen Kohan   Leave a comment 
 As the sun sets on summer 2016, use the upcoming Labor Day weekend as a catalyst to recalibrate you career trajectory. 
 Why Labor Day? Timing is everything. This weekend marks a transition between seasons and a sense of 'starting over' as a new school year begins. 
 When you arrive @work on Tuesday morning your plans will collide with the competing interests of colleagues returning to work, equally energized and motivated. If you have a plan, and a schedule of activities already on your calendar you will be in a position to maintain the momentum, moving you closer to your 'dream'. 
 Start with two questions: 
 What do I still want to accomplish? 
 What is one thing I can do move forward? 
 Your answer to the first question asserts your priorities, and the second sets the first item on your agenda. 
 When thinking about priorities, consider feedback you have received from managers, colleagues, mentors and friends. What skills need fine tuning? Is there additional expertise you need to acquire to advance in your current position or transition to a new workplace? Who can help you achieve your goals? Is it time for additional training or an advanced degree? 
 The 'still want to accomplish' question hits at the fundamental essence of who you are, who you want to become, and the legacy you want to leave behind. It has a workplace component, but also addresses work/life balance, and your role as a contributing member of your community. 
 The next step is to schedule a meeting to set your priorities in motion: coffee with a mentor to review your career direction, an information interview to establish a new professional connection, a visit to a local non-profit, or a meeting with an academic advisor to explore educational options. 
 Your priorities dictate your agenda. 
 Before the weekend comes to an end, take a few minutes to review your calendar and block out time for 'summer energy reserves expenditures'. Send at least one email requesting a meeting and try to find time each week to sit down with folks who can expand your career horizons. 
 Effectively managing your work/life is an ongoing energy expense. It will keep you moving forward, recalibrating as needed.

 The week@work - Grad students win right to unionize, the changing conversation about the economy, why America's leaders fail and the story of Luke's Lobster 
 August 29, 2016 Eileen Kohan   Leave a comment 
 Academia was in the headlines this week@work with the Tuesday announcement from the National Labor Relations Board, voting 3-1 to overturn a 2004 ruling allowing graduate students to form collective bargaining units. A Pew Research Center survey detected a shift in election season conversation from the economy (2012) to keeping the U.S. safe from terrorism. What conversation? The system isn't working, and it may be we don't have leaders who view their 'calling' as a 'vocation'. And finally, a career transition story - from investment banker to 'lobsterpreneur' for this last week of summer. 
 'Ruling Pushes Door to Grad-Student Unions ‘Wide Open’   Peter Schmidt  for The Chronicle of Higher Education 
 " Many more private universities can expect to see their graduate employees move to form unions in the wake of Tuesday’s National Labor Relations Board decision on such an effort at Columbia University. 
 The federal labor board’s 3-to-1 ruling resoundingly overturned a 2004 decision involving Brown University. In the Brown ruling, the board asserted that graduate employees should not be allowed to form unions because their doing so would intrude into the educational process. 
 In Tuesday’s decision, the majority held that such a belief "is unsupported by legal authority, by empirical evidence, or by the board’s actual experience." It not only rejected the Brown precedent, but also overturned a 1974 ruling that had declared research assistants at Stanford University ineligible to unionize based on a belief that such research is part of the educational process. 
 The board’s decision in the Columbia case says graduate students employed by a private university are as eligible as any other type of worker to form collective-bargaining units under the National Labor Relations Act. " 
 In a  letter  to the Columbia University community,  Provost John H. Coatsworth  reiterated the long-held view of university administrators. 
 " Columbia and many of our peer universities have challenged this position. Nearly all of the students at Columbia affected by this decision are graduate students. We believe that the daily activities and the advisor-advisee relationships involved in the scholarly training of graduate students define an experience that is different from that of the typical workplace. Being a graduate student can take many years of intense research, teaching and study. But unlike university employees, graduate students who serve as teaching or research assistants come to this institution first and foremost to acquire through that work the knowledge and expertise that are essential to their becoming future scholars and teachers." 
 The world of academia is changing, and with it the profile of the teaching community. As more adjunct faculty assume the classroom role, it may be harder to differentiate the job description of part-time faculty from that of grad assistant. 
 To be continued… 
 'Since 2012, The Economy Has Changed — And So Has The Conversation'   Marilyn Geewax  for NPR 
 " Ah, 2012. You seem so long ago. 
 Back then, the economy was the star of the presidential election season, with more than 9 in 10 voters ranking it as Issue No. 1. 
 Voters worried about scarce jobs, expensive gasoline and a huge federal deficit. 
 Candidates proposed detailed solutions … 
 This year, the political conversation is very different, with much of the focus on non-economic issues: Republican Donald Trump 's temperament and Democrat Hillary Clinton's trustworthiness. 
 And a Pew Research Center survey showed that the issue voters want to hear about most in a presidential debate is "keeping the US safe from terrorism." 
 Of course, economic issues remain extremely important, but they are different from 2012. This year, the hottest money topics involve income inequality, trade deals and immigrants. " 
 Why are we focused on temperament and trustworthiness while the 'big problems' that effect our daily lives are ignored? David Brooks thinks it's about career vs. calling, and he may be right. 
 'Why America’s Leadership Fails'   David Brooks  for The New York Times 
 " Over the past few decades, thousands of good people have gone into public service, but they have found themselves enmeshed in a system that drains them of their sense of vocation. 
 Let’s start with a refresher on the difference between a vocation and a career. A career is something you choose; a vocation is something you are called to. 
 A person choosing a career asks, How can I get the best job or win the most elections? A person summoned by a vocation asks, How can my existing abilities be put in service of the greatest common good? 
 A career is a job you do as long as the benefits outweigh the costs; a vocation involves falling in love with something, having a conviction about it and making it part of your personal identity. 
 A vocation involves promises to some ideal, it reveals itself in a sense of enjoyment as you undertake its tasks and it can’t be easily quit when setbacks and humiliations occur. As others have noted, it involves a double negative — you can’t not do this thing. 
 I do think there’s often an arc to vocation. People start with something outside themselves. Then, in the scramble to get established, the ambition of self takes over. But then at some point people realize the essential falseness of all that and they try to reconnect with their original animating ideals. 
 And so I think it possible to imagine a revival of vocation. " 
 The last story this week@work is an 'end of summer' career transition feature. 
 'A Restaurant’s Sales Pitch: Know Your Lobster'   Janet Morrissey  for The New York Times 
 " It was a steamy summer day in New York in 2009 when Luke Holden, an investment banker, had a craving for a lobster roll. Not just any lobster roll, though. He longed for the “fresh off the docks” taste he enjoyed growing up in Cape Elizabeth, Me. 
 After an exhaustive search on New York’s streets, he came up dissatisfied and disappointed. 
 “Every lobster was served over a white tablecloth, extremely expensive, drowning in mayo and diluted with celery,” he said. “I wondered why all the great chefs in this city had screwed this up so badly.” 
 So that year, Mr. Holden decided to open an authentic Maine lobster shack in Manhattan. To replicate that fresh taste that he remembered, he would need to oversee, track and, where possible, own every step in the process. 
 Today, he owns 19 Luke’s Lobster restaurants, two food trucks and a lobster tail cart in the United States, and five shacks in Japan. " 
 If you only read one of these this week, spend some time with David Brooks…and reconnect with your  " original animating ideals"  and begin a _" revival of vocation". _

 Your first day @work is not that different from your first day @college 
 August 25, 2016August 25, 2016 Eileen Kohan   Leave a comment 
 Late last month, The New York Times  shared advice  for incoming college freshman from 25 upperclassmen and recent grads. As I read the article, I noted a parallel in the seven topics offered for new students, and folks in their first months @work - from the first internship through every career transition. 
 " Freshman year is a chance to redefine yourself, to challenge assumptions, to lay the foundation for the rest of your life." 
 The first day of work is also a chance to redefine yourself, challenge assumptions and begin to lay the foundation of your career. 
 Let's examine the list of seven, and test their application to the workplace. 
 _" Extend yourself" _You are the 'newbie' @work. You're not expected to have all the answers on day one. Ask questions. Explore the world beyond your cubicle. Find 'community spaces' where folks gather, and mingle. 
 _" Do the work" _ In college, this is basically showing up for class, @work it's consistently engaging in projects. Don't wait to be asked. Offer to participate in assignments that will stretch your talents. 
 _" Understand the system and work it" _Every workplace has its unique culture, values and traditions. If you did your research before you started your new job, you should have an inkling of what to expect. Once you are on payroll, take some time to observe how folks communicate, how priorities are set, where the budget dollars are allocated, and who is making the decisions. Align yourself with the energized vs. the disgruntled. 
 _" Be yourself" _Hopefully you selected a workplace that is a 'fit' with your values and talents. If the recruitment process was straightforward, being the 'authentic' you will contribute to your success. 
 You will change as part of a new work community, just as you evolved throughout your college years in an environment that fostered success, creativity, and diversity. Check in periodically with friends outside your workplace to ensure you're growing vs. losing your essential essence. 
 _" Tend to yourself", "Your grade in one class does not define you" _ These tidbits of advice applied to work fall into the categories of work/life balance and recovering from failure. It's very easy to be consumed by the work in the beginning. You're learning new concepts, meeting new people, struggling to make deadlines, and communicating in a new workplace language. If you're not spending time outside of work socializing, contributing to your community or maintaining a fitness routine; your work will eventually suffer. 
 When you do make a mistake, your career isn't over. The upper strata of success is populated with folks who have recovered from both minor and major workplace calamity. 
 _" Develop people skills" _ Without solid communication skills, every day at work will be a challenge. Our work culture has traditionally rewarded the extrovert, but new research has shown the introvert is an equal partner in the success of any organization. 
 In college you may have been able to get an 'A' as an individual, rarely leaving your room, thinking great thoughts and rarely interacting with the campus community. @work you have to deal with people. You may be the most brilliant innovator, but at some point you have to explain your product to a client. 
 All of us can improve our communication skills and it's to an organization's advantage to support you in this effort. Find out if there are skill development programs available through your employer or professional association. Be proactive on this one. 
 _ "Don't get stuck" _Life doesn't always go according to plan. Entering college you may have thought you would be the next Bill Gates, when a Freshman Seminar introduced you to the wonderful world of philosophy. Tangents open up @work as well. Entering an organization for the first time, you cannot imagine the variety of opportunities that are available. You may be in a meeting with a client and realize the work his/her organization is doing is a better fit for you skills. Be open when an alternative is presented. There is no perfect career path, just one that is unique to you. 
 One more - always share what you learn with colleagues. Knowledge is power. Shared information can be transformative.

 'The Ageing Athlete' a poem by Neil Weiss 
 August 19, 2016August 19, 2016 Eileen Kohan   Leave a comment 
 As the Games of the XXXI Olympiad come to an end, a 'Friday Poem' to consider life after sport…and other career transitions. 
 The Aging Athlete 
 You’re through – no walking up and down, 
 you think of speed and dig your heels, 
 testing this soil and that for a start, 
 but it’s no go…Practicing for leaps, 
 you start forward but exhaust the push 
 and end up with a damaging rush, 
 arms hanging, hands twitching at your sides, 
 chin bobbing on your chest: no pride 
 that once sustained you as you leapt 
 the next hurdle, hair up then down, 
 the wind in your ears, the crowd beside 
 itself, shouting, Come on! Come on! 
 and you smashed the tape with your chest 
 and sank into the arms of many lovers. 
 Neil Weiss Poetry Magazine, August 1956

 The one thing every Olympian should do before they leave Rio 2016 
 August 9, 2016 Eileen Kohan   Leave a comment 
 The one thing every Olympian should do before they leave Rio is update their social media identity across all platforms. 
 For a brief moment in time Olympic athletes capture the global stage and water cooler conversations. It's not only those who make the podium, but those we discover in the diverse narratives of their journeys to Rio. The majority will return to their home countries as national heroes, contributing to society, away from the media spotlight. A few may return as coaches or commentators in four years. Most will miss the opportunity to capture the Olympic experience as a bridge to the next phase of their career. 
 In the past I have worked with returning Olympians who hesitate to include their achievements in sport on their resume. The most competitive athletes are the most reticent to record their accomplishments. 
 They just don't think it's relevant. It is. 
 In the global workplace, it's not just the resume; social media communicates talent instantaneously to potential employers. Your professional image is transmitted through your social media identity. 
 On Saturday, American  Virginia Thrasher  won the first gold medal awarded at the games in the women's the 10-meter air rifle. Within a few hours she was taking her first TV interview on NBC, describing her hectic schedule of additional events and starting her sophomore year at West Virginia University. 
 In describing her life over the next couple of weeks, Thrasher gave voice to the stress that accompanies the life of every student athlete, combining sport with academics. Often lost, is time for reflection on how these experiences transform the athlete into a professional @work. 
 How do you build the bridge from sport to work on social media? 
 Take a look at your social media presence across all platforms: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, LinkedIn, Twitter… 
 Do all the pieces fit into a unifying narrative? If not, it's time to edit. As an Olympian, expectations have been raised and your online image should reflect your aspirations vs. social missteps. 
 Have you created links to videos and press coverage of your accomplishments? 
 Do you post videos and press coverage on your Twitter account? 
 Have you checked with third party sites to ensure your profile information is up to date? 
 Do you have an account on LinkedIn? (If you're making the transition from sport to your next career, this component of your professional online identity is critical as you build your 'next career' network.) 
 There are many athletes who hesitate to be defined by their sport, but the skills developed in pursuit of Olympic gold closely match those sought by potential employers: teamwork, goal orientation, communications, problem-solving, and resilience. 
 Whether you are a summer Olympian, or a star on your own professional stage, it's time to seize the moment and refresh you social media identity.

 The week@work - A vacancy on the Supreme Court, the power of creative cross training, deciding to 'jump ship' and targeting teachers 
 February 14, 2016February 15, 2016 Eileen Kohan   Leave a comment 
 The headline story of the week@work came with the late Saturday evening announcement of the death of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. The theme of transition was echoed in other stories this week, on creative cross-training and deciding when to make your next career move. If you are a teacher, you may be considering both, as educational reform efforts seem to be targeting those leading the classroom vs. students. 
 A few hours before the Republican candidates were to take the stage in their on-going interview process for the job of U.S. president, news broke that conservative Supreme Court Justice  Antonin Scalia  had died. Within seconds, it seemed, politicians were redefining the rules on the naming of a successor. In terms of job openings, it's one of the most coveted appointments in government. The vacancy in the judicial branch will be added to the open position of President and  469 seats in Congress  on November 8. It's enough to overwhelm your average Human Resources manager. Oh, wait, we are the human resources manager here. Time to start paying attention to resumes and experience. 
 Most of us hope to find meaning in our work, and make some impact on our community with our efforts. For Justice Scalia, his impact was  described  by  Jeffrey Toobin  for The New Yorker. 
 " The loss of Justice Antonin Scalia is immensely significant on two levels. First, Scalia himself ranks among the most influential Justices in American history, alongside such figures as John Marshall, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., and William Brennan. Second, Scalia was the linchpin of the Supreme Court’s five-justice conservative majority. His departure gives President Obama—or a Democratic successor—the opportunity to reshape the ideological balance among the Justices. 
 When Scalia joined the court, in 1986, the leading school of constitutional interpretation was the “living Constitution”—the claim that the meaning of the document evolves with changes in American society. Scalia brought with him the concept of “originalism”—that the Constitution should be interpreted as its eighteenth-century framers understood it. In practical terms, originalism gives constitutional sanction to conservative politics. 
 In interpreting laws, he was the leading spokesperson for “textualism,” the idea that, when interpreting laws, courts should look not to legislative history, or congressional “intent,” but rather only to the words of the law itself. While originalism remains controversial within the legal community, textualism won support from nearly all his colleagues (all except Stephen Breyer). This means that the Justices will limit the reach of laws to their precise terms, expanding the court’s power over Congress. " 
 Srinivas Rao  writes about  'The Power of Creative Cross Training: How Experimentation Creates Possibility' . 
 Although he is describing the careers of creative professionals, his suggestions to immerse yourself in tangential activities to broaden your thinking and portfolio, has broad application across career disciplines. 
 " For most creative professionals, we have a tendency to live within the limitations of our labels: copywriter, web designer, filmmaker, illustrator, and author. Those are the things we do and we get paid for. 
 The point of creative cross training is to immerse yourself for a short period of time in an art form that is not your primary one. For a writer that could mean designing or drawing something. For a visual artist, that could mean learning to write code. " 
 An entrepreneur doesn't have the luxury of labels, and must continually cross train to develop a suite of skills in marketing, finance, customer relations and communication. If you have the mindset of an entrepreneur, creative cross training will become your mandatory daily ritual to stay competitive irrespective of profession. 
 Creative cross training allows you to take ownership of your career and be prepared for changes @work.  Paul Sullivan  explored the  risks  for folks who have 'jumped ship', leaving a stable career to pursue a passion. 
 " …a  Gallup Poll  in October found that when American workers make a career change, they almost always do so by leaving their employer instead of taking a new job within the company. Some 93 percent said they took a new role elsewhere. The survey found this was true whether the job change occurred 30 years ago or within the last year. 
 … consider the tale of DeJuan Stroud, a former Wall Street broker and compliance officer…he gave up his well-paid job and put their modest savings at risk to turn a hobby — floral design, which he had learned from his grandmother growing up in Alabama — into a business. 
 Now, two decades later, Mr. Stroud is one of the most sought-after floral and event designers in New York City. 
 His is a success story. But there are big risks in following a similar path — giving up a regular salary and losing your savings for one; throwing away the security of a career is another. For those who go forward, the payoff may be more psychic than monetary, and they need to feel comfortable that the chance of a more modest lifestyle is worth it. " 
 For some reason, its become ok in our society to devalue the folks who inspire, encourage and transfer knowledge to each generation. Well, it's not ok and  David Denby  urges us to  'Stop Humiliating Teachers' . 
 " A necessary commonplace: Almost everyone we know has been turned around, or at least seriously shaken, by a teacher—in college, maybe, but often in high school, often by a man or a woman who drove home a point or two about physics, literature, or ethics, and looked at us sternly and said, in effect, You could be more than what you are. At their best, teachers are everyday gods, standing at the entryway to the world. If they are fair and good, they are possibly the most morally impressive adults that their students will ever know. For a while, they are the law, they are knowledge, they are justice. 
 Our view of American public education in general has been warped by our knowledge of these failing kids in inner-city and rural schools. In particular, the system as a whole has been described by “reformers” as approaching breakdown. But this is nonsense. There are actually many good schools in the United States—in cities, in suburbs, in rural areas. Pathologizing the system as a whole, reformers insist on drastic reorganization, on drastic methods of teacher accountability. In the past dozen or so years, we’ve seen the efforts, often led by billionaires and hedge-fund managers and supported by elected officials, to infuse K-12 education with models and methods derived from the business world—for instance, the drive to privatize education as much as possible with charter schools, which receive public money but are independently run and often financed by entrepreneurs. This drive is accompanied by a stream of venom aimed at unions, as if they were the problem in American education. (Most charter schools hire non-union teachers.) In the real world, however, highly unionized areas of the country, such as the Northeast, produce students with scores higher than the national average in standardized tests; the Deep South, where union teachers are more scarce, produces scores that are lower. So unions alone can hardly   be the problem. " 
 Many recent college graduates, and career changers consider teaching as a career. In reality, our society values the profession at 70% of what peers in other professions earn. Teachers may not be motivated by money, but that doesn't allow the rest of us to abdicate our responsibility. It's time to place a higher premium on those who significantly influence our future. 
 Two additional articles of interest to consider this week@work: 
 'Women in Company Leadership Tied to Stronger Profits, Study Says'  by  Daniel Victor   " Having women in the highest corporate offices is correlated with increased profitability, according to a new study of nearly 22,000 publicly traded companies in 91 countries." 
 'Why do my co-workers keep confusing me with other people? Because I’m Asian.'  by  Iris Kuo   " All my life I’ve been mistaken for other people of my race. It’s a degrading and thoughtless error that boils away my identity and simplifies me as one thing: “that Asian.”

 This one is for the Class of 2009 
 December 16, 2015 Eileen Kohan   Leave a comment 
 This past weekend Paramount Pictures released  'The Big Short'  based on the 2010  Michael Lewis  book of the same  title  about the build up of the housing and credit bubble in the first years of the new millennium. 
 There were many casualties of the worst financial crisis since the great depression. I thought it might be worthwhile, as moviegoers line up for tickets, to revisit that time and the impact on those who graduated from college in 2009. 
 It took a few months for the ripples of economic crisis to reach college campuses. But in the fall of 2008 corporate recruiters began to cancel on-campus interviews and career fairs shrunk to a quarter of their previous year's participation. 
 Students who had entered college in the fall of 2005 faced optimistic prospects as the economy was booming and entry level jobs were plentiful. But the global economy began to turn in the spring of junior year, with many heading off to summer internships in anticipation of transitioning to full time work at graduation. 
 By final exams in 2008, things were looking bleak. Here is an excerpt of a blog I wrote on December 11th. 
 " When the semester began in August, not even the experts could have predicted the level of change we would experience this fall. While each academic year provides opportunities to embrace challenge and celebrate success, these past four months have created historical moments with the potential to redefine our place in the world. 
 As you are writing your final papers and studying for exams, let’s take a minute to review what we have learned. 
 First, we are in an age of globalization. If you have been hiding under the covers for the past ten years, the economic downturn brought the reality of the global banking community to the forefront. In a few short months we have learned more than we may have wanted to know about real estate, mortgages, investment banking, insurance and the auto industry. And we now have a better sense of how our domestic economy depends on the health of these industries. For many of us, the impact of the downturn in the economy has hit close to home with friends and family out of work. 
 Change can be difficult. If you are a freshman this year, your transition from high school to college is a fresh memory. There was the excitement of a new place mixed with missing friends and family. With every new opportunity to change there is a sentimental longing for the past. For seniors, there is the anticipation of the next step: graduate school, professional school, a new job or and entrepreneurial start up. It is a time of hope mixed with uncertainty. 
 You are a part of a historic moment in time. Become an active participant. If opportunities in a career field are limited, look toward the new careers emerging as a result of change. All you have learned this semester in your classes, organizations and internships have provided you with a solid foundation to adjust and adapt. This is your strength. " 
 If the rumors are true, the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this week, bringing an end to the economic downturn that began in the spring of 2008. 
 I think it's important not to forget the lessons learned in 2008 and 2009. Check your social network and schedule a sit down with a 2009 graduate. Get a first person account of how to recalibrate a career path to eventually arrive at success.

 #TheGreatListen 2015 
 November 23, 2015November 23, 2015 Eileen Kohan   Leave a comment 
 What if you could capture a generation of American lives and experiences in one holiday weekend? That's the vision of  StoryCorps  founder,  Dave Isay , and he plans to fulfill his mission this Thanksgiving weekend through a combination of an  app  and an  educators toolkit  to enable DIY interviews to gather the wisdom of others. It's the #GreatThanksgivingListen and you are invited to attend. 
 StoryCorps recently celebrated twelve years of conducting and recording oral history interviews, beginning with a booth in New York's Grand Central Station and later taking the booth on the road to all 50 states creating the largest single collection of human voices ever gathered. The next step is to grow the archive of 100,000 to tens of thousands. 
 Dave Isay and his organization are the recipients of the 2015 TED Prize, and it was in his  presentation  to the annual conference in April that he outlined his proposal for a  " national homework assignment" . 
 Here's the plan. Download the app, select 'helpful hints' for a short tutorial. Select 'browse' to view previous StoryCorps recordings. Go to 'my interviews' to outline and record your interview. You can choose from a list of sample questions by categories. Next step - record! 
 " Who are they? What did they learn in life? How would they like to be remembered?" 
 And here's the magical part. You can keep your recording for yourself or opt to upload it to the StoryCorps archive at the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. Imagine the story of your family intertwined with other American voices building upon a historical record of their time. 
 In his April TED talk, Isay described the power of _ "…everyday people talking about lives lived with kindness, courage, decency and dignity…it sometimes feels like you are walking on holy ground…"_ 
 If you believe that you learn from the wisdom of others, this holiday offers an opportunity to join  " …a global movement to record and preserve meaningful conversations with one another that results in an ever growing digital archive of the collective wisdom of humanity."

 Planning for the Thanksgiving Career Conversation 
 November 17, 2015 Eileen Kohan   1 Comment 
 It's the annual celebration of Thanksgiving, that time of year when families get together and complain about dissatisfaction with work. What if we approached the holiday season as an opportunity for taking action on shelved career plans? 
 We tend to think of the holidays as a time to get away from our workplace. And yet, it can be a time to reconsider career choices and solicit input from family and friends. 
 Let's reimagine the pre or post-dinner conversation that has previously been a competition to demonstrate who has the worst boss, longest hours, deadest of dead end jobs. Consider a conversation where you identify your spot on your career timeline, articulate your goals and ask for guidance on next steps. 
 Your friends and family are your most trusted advisors. They're the folks who know all your faults and are still there. Don't waste their time with a whining session. Respect their abilities to listen and share feedback. 
 Start with the past year and what you have accomplished. Even in the worst job situation we can salvage a few learning experiences, from both failure and success. Come up with a way to communicate your skills, leaving out acronyms, to enable folks to envision how your strengths apply across fields. 
 Next, recall that dream job that has been tantalizing you, but disappears in the fog of the everyday demands of the workplace. Got it? Now you have your baseline and end goal. Don't be shy about sharing it. 
 What's missing? The interim steps to get you from point A to point B. 
 And this is where those negative conversations turn into positive and productive discussions. Now that you have shared your goals, folks are empowered to help: adding to your list of skills based on a long term view of your career, providing input on strategy and offering connections to keep the conversation going after the holidays. 
 It's not just the folks who are contemplating career transition that can benefit from these holiday interactions. If you think all is well in your career, a close confidant can often detect warning signs you may be missing in your optimism. 
 The real value of your family/friends 'board of advisors' is their ability to hold you accountable to your dream. You will see them, same time next year, and they will ask you how far you've travelled on the road to your destination.
