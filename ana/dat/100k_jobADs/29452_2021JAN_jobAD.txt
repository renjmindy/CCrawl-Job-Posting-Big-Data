 Since 1971, WSC has assisted individuals with disabilities in obtaining and retaining employment. 
 Our employment specialists help individuals with:

 WSC accepts walk-ins as well as referrals from the  Texas Workforce Solutions- Vocational Rehabilitation Services . Our only requirement for this service is that you provide documentation of your disability. Applicants must bring the following: 
 
 Diagnosis of a disability on official letterhead from the diagnosing agency

 If you have a disability or know someone with a disability who wants a job in the Wichita Falls area or our other locations, please contact our Human Services Department.
