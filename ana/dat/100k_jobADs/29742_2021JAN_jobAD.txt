 Comvoy Announces Partnership with HomeAdvisor, Helping Businesses Find the Right Vehicle for the Job 
 Comvoy marketplace ensures service professionals find the best purpose-built work trucks and vans, nationwide 
 CHICO, California - March 3, 2020 - Today, Comvoy, the first and only structured, searchable marketplace for work-ready trucks and vans, announces its partnership with HomeAdvisor, one of the largest home services marketplaces, to help HomeAdvisor's network of service professionals find the right vehicles they need for their jobs. 
 Together, both companies are supporting their communities of skilled trades professionals, vocational workers, and home service providers, ensuring they have the resources they need to do their jobs and find consistent work. 
 HomeAdvisor's nationwide network of pros represent nearly every home service industry, including HVAC, contracting, landscaping, electrical, roofing, and more. These businesses rely on customized work trucks and vans as a crucial tool to complete a day's work. Comvoy, a subsidiary of Work Truck Solutions, uses highly detailed configuration data, intuitive search, and integrated insights to guide businesses to the right vehicle they need for their jobs--and connects them to local dealers where they can buy it, quickly. 
 "We strive to provide our network of pros with the tips, tools, and information to grow and succeed in their business," said Craig Smith, President and COO of HomeAdvisor. "We're excited to introduce Comvoy as a free resource to our pros--ensuring they can quickly find the right vehicle for their jobs." 
 Comvoy allows HomeAdvisor's service professionals, who are often small businesses, to research, find, and get the best purpose-built vehicle for their job, searching by vocation/industry, vehicle body type, or manufacturer. 
 "The goal of this partnership is to support all of the hard-working businesses that maintain our infrastructure and comprise the backbone of the U.S. economy," said Comvoy CEO, Kathryn Schifferle. "We've teamed up to educate Comvoy buyers about the opportunities available to them through HomeAdvisor's community, while also giving existing Pros an easy-to-use resource to find the vehicles they need. We want to help these businesses expand their local networks, generate new business leads, and most importantly, support their livelihoods."
