  5 Tips For Staying Sane During A Holiday Job Search  
 Ariella Coombs 
 November 24, 2016 
 Welcome to the holidays! That means pretty lights, festive music, family, friends, great food, and endless party invitations. Oh it's the most wonderful time of the year! But it's also the most stressful. Between fighting the crowds, hustling at work, scheduling holiday events, and making tasty treats, the holidays can be a crazy time... especially if you're looking for a job. So, how can you stay sane during your holiday job search? Here are some tips that will help you cope with all of the stress that comes with the holidays: 
 
 1. Make room for me. 
 You give so much of your time to others during the holidays - what about YOU? "Me" time is so important during your holiday job search. If you want to be on your game for those job interviews, you need to give yourself sometime to relax, clear your head, and allow yourself to decompress. If taking "me" time is hard for you, physically block off time in your calendar - even if it's just 10 minutes. That's YOUR 10 minutes! 
 2. Unplug. 
 You don't need to be on your phone 24/7, okay? Give it a rest. If you're chained to your phone, email, and social media, it will add to your stress load. Unplug for a little bit. There's nothing THAT important on Facebook or Instagram that you need to see. 
 3. Stay hydrated. 
 Not drinking enough water will make you feel tired, which makes doing all of that fun holiday stuff  that  much harder to do. Plus, dehydration can cause miserable headaches - and you DEFINITELY don't have time for that. 
 4. Be active. 
 In addition to setting aside time for yourself, you should make sure you set aside time to exercise. It will help you shed that negative energy that sometimes builds up during the holidays. Those FEISTY little endorphins can help you with that! 
 5. SLEEP! 
 This is the most important. When you're exhausted, it can be hard to see the bright side of situations (especially during a holiday job search). Make sure you rest yourself - even if that means taking a 20 minute power nap during the day. (Did you like this article? Check out " How To Deal With Holiday Job Search .")
