 Thoughts for today, #223 …. “Excellent job, Mr. Jorge Ramos"!!

 THANK YOU, MR. JORGE RAMOS 
 
 In taking on  Jorge Ramos  , Donald Trump may have tussled with the wrong media star 
 
 In his latest showdown, Donald Trump ordered Univision anchor  Jorge Ramos  out of a news conference Tuesday, telling him to "  go back to Univision ." 
 Ramos, who like Trump is known for his confrontational style, didn't back down until he was  escorted  out of the room by security. Eventually, Ramos was invited back, where he sparred with Trump over the Republican candidate's immigration proposals. 
 But prodding Ramos, who has been called the  Spanish-language Walter Cronkite  , could prove dangerous for Trump, who thus far been something of a Teflon candidate. 
 
 HERE 'S WHY 
 
 Ramos is a very important figure for American Latinos 
 Ramos has a personal connection to immigration issues 
 Ramos sees himself as an advocate for millions of Latino immigrants, and so do they 
 Much like Trump, Ramos seems to welcome conflict and doesn't often back down

 About Dr. Rex 
 I'm originally from Puerto Rico. I was born in Santurce and raised in Rio Piedras. Have lived in Florida since 1999. I have a doctorate degree in Medicine; completed in 1976. My Internal Medicine specialty was completed in 1979. Worked for Puerto Rico's health system until 1985. At this time, I'm happily retired after working for the federal government for almost 28yrs. I want to offer any knowledge that I have to anyone "out there" who is interested. My views are liberal in almost every sense. My knowledge is "eclectic" - a bit of everything. Music and reading are my passion. Blogging has also become a very interesting endeavor. Metaphysical topics attract me. I'm interested in news reporting human issues like injustice, discrimination and abuse - the "wrongly" affected. My intention is to bring this knowledge to an understandable level and to help anyone in need. I'm open to questions and will answer them to the best of my ability. Currently working on an enterprise whose main mission will be to bring peoples of all walks of life together. To be one .... since we ALL are ONE!! The future looks bright and promising!!!
