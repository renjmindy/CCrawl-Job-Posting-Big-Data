 Career in engineering physics 
 Posted in  careers  by  newsinhyderabad 
 
 Have a strong interest in physics and an aptitude for science and engineering? A primer on the courses available in engineering physics 
 
 Only a few institutions offer B.Tech-level programme in engineering physics. Four-year-long B.Tech course, five-year integrated M.Tech course and five-year dual degree M.Tech programmes are being offered by institutes like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the Institute of Technology of the Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi. Selection to these institutes is through a national-level IIT joint entrance examination conducted annually. 
 Meritorious students who have passed Plus Two or equivalent examination in the regular stream with 60 per cent marks in aggregate in physics, chemistry and mathematics are eligible to apply for IIT-JEE. Final year Plus Two students are also eligible to appear for the exam. 
 Study facilities 
 IIT-Madras, Bombay and Delhi offer B. Tech programmes in engineering physics. Institute of Technology at Varanasi under the Banaras Hindu University offers five-year integrated M.Tech course in engineering physics. IIT-Bombay offers five-year dual degree M.Tech programme in engineering physics with specialisation in nanoscience. The Department of Physics of IIT Bombay offers both B.Tech and dual degree M.Tech in engineering physics. The B.Tech programme is the oldest of its kind in the country. The curriculum lays stress on the basic physics that underlies new technological developments. The engineering physics students are also offered electives in several applied areas such as VLSI technology, electronics instrumentation and fibre optic communication. A dual degree programme in engineering physics was started in 2005-06. After the five-year-long programme students are awarded a dual degree B.Tech and M.Tech in engineering physics with specialisation in nanoscience. 
 At IT-BHU 
 The Institute of Technology (IT) of Banaras Hindu University (BHU), Varanasi offers a five-year M.Tech integrated course in engineering physics which trains young students in the area of space physics, plasma physics and fibre optics. Courses in solid state physics, quantum mechanics, thermodynamic, statistical mechanics, materials physics, applied nuclear science and remote sensing are also included. For more details visit  www.itbhu.ac.in  . Admission is based on IIT-JEE that covers three separate sections on chemistry, mathematics and physics. For more details visit  http://jee.iitm.ac.in 
 Career prospects 
 Those who successfully complete the above courses will have employment opportunities with government organisations such as Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), and National Physical Laboratory apart from teaching profession. Campus placement facilities are also available in IITs.
