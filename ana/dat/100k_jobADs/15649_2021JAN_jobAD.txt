 THE SAD REALITY 
 
 With two more days to go in 2016, we'd thought the passing of beloved ones would have ended. 
 George Michael, Christmas day. Carrie Fisher, the day after. 
 And Debbie Reynolds, a day after her daughter's passing. 
 Many have expressed how unforgiving 2016 has been. 
 Here's one more example. 
 Strength to all those left behind. 
 I think we are going to need it.

 ~Singin’ in the Rain scene that made Debbie Reynolds a star~ 
 Debbie Reynolds  — who died December 28 at age 84 — was 19 years-old when her life changed forever. 
 After cutting her teeth on cabaret performances and winning the Miss Burbank pageant in 1948, Reynolds landed the part of  Kathy Selden  in  Singin’ in the Rain  , the 1952 classic that would launch her career. She was to sing and dance opposite  Donald O’Connor  and  Gene Kelly  , lauded Hollywood mainstays with decades of performing experience, while she had almost none, and zero dancing experience to speak of.

 Debbie Reynolds  - who rose to stardom in "  Singin ' in the Rain " and quickly became a staple among Hollywood royalty - died Wednesday, December 28, as a result of a stroke, just one day after her daughter Carrie Fisher passed away, according to her son Todd.

 Good Morning 1952 
 _Gene Kelly & Debbie Reynolds & Donald O'Connor _ 
 Published on Mar 7, 2015 
 
 I was a toddler when this movie came out. My love for music, movies eventually lead me to this timeless classic. 
 I grew up with the presence of Debbie Reynolds in my life. 
 A huge void has been left behind.

 Horty 
 I'm originally from Puerto Rico. I was born in Santurce and raised in Rio Piedras. I currently live in Florida - since 1999. I have a doctorate degree in Medicine; completed in 1976. My Internal Medicine specialty was completed in 1979. Worked for Puerto Rico's health system until 1985. At this time, I'm happily retired after working for the federal government for almost 28yrs. I also worked for the government of Puerto Rico from 1979 through 1985 .... for a total of almost 40 years as a physician. I want to offer any knowledge that I have to anyone "out there" who is interested. My views are liberal in almost every sense. My knowledge is "eclectic" - a bit of everything. Music and reading are my passion. Blogging has also become a very interesting endeavor. Metaphysical topics attract me. I'm interested in news - reporting human issues like injustice, discrimination and abuse - the "wrongly" affected. My intention is to bring this knowledge to an understandable level and to help anyone in need. I'm open to questions and will answer them to the best of my ability. Currently working on an enterprise whose main mission will be to bring peoples of all walks of life together. To be one .... since we ALL are ONE!! The future looks bright and promising!!!
