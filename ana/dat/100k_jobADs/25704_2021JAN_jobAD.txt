 My rating:  5 of 5 stars 
 I received a free ARC via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. 
 This book is one of the best books I’ve read on the topic of zodiac signs for these reasons: 
 
 lots of information, given in a compact and concise manner 
 the description of the star sign I was born under was bang on, This should be an indication that others are just as accurate. 
 So much more than just zodiac signs in this book. I love some of the other sections, like the 20 Tibetan Keys to Happiness, crystals and chakras. 
 
 This book is well worth reading, jam packed with useful information, detailed enough to be valuable and practical, but short enough to be enjoyable to read and easy to absorb. I bookmarked and highlighted a ton Of pages, and I always find the total number of those are directly related to the value I get from the book..
