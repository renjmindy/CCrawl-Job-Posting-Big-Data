 Okay 
 Look At This! it's a Full-time job 
 SpecialGuest is looking for a Copywriter in Brooklyn, NY, USA. Not an traditional Copywriter but the kind of Copywriter that makes other Copywriters question their Copywriter-ness. 
 About 
 SpecialGuest is seeking a copywriter who can think big and high-level for a global campaign (for a social media app) and loves writing very human and authentic stories. SpecialGuest is a small and mighty team where everyone wears multiple hats and has a lot of responsibility. Our clients come to us for new ways to communicate or visualize ideas so we are looking for a copywriter that wants to shake off the tired ways of doing things. 
 We are currently working remotely, so copywriters outside of Brooklyn are encouraged to apply. Please note that you may start as a freelancer, with the opportunity to continue full time. 
 Details: 
5-11 years of experience 
Art director-like creative thinking capabilities 
Global campaign experience 
Experience across all media 
Non-traditional copy experience is helpful
