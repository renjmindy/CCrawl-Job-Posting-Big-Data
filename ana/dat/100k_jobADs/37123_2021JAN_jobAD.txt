 The Italian Job 
 It's been awhile since I used my favorite Orton effect. It is a feature in PixlrExpress that I got addicted to. But it doesn't work every time, so I really needed to be careful not to slap it on every image I was editing. 
 Oh, happy days! It worked on this one, so my addiction was fed one more time. 
 
 I like the softness it gives, almost like a velvet, it feels to me like the walls would be smooth and soft to my touch. Strange, I knowâ€¦but try living in my head for a minute. I dare you. 
 I took my time taking images of this building, until I realized it was the bank and the guards were looking strange at me. Maybe they thought I was preparing for **  The Italian Job **? ðŸ˜€

 Ah Orton, it is an addictive filter of choice. Here it works well giving the slight glow, and you are right it doesn't work everytime.

 Thank you, Ben. Couldn't agree more about Orton. I try to stay away as much as possible. ðŸ™‚
