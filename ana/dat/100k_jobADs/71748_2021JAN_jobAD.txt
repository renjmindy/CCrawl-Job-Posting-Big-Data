 How I left my job and changed career 
 January 20, 2018 
 A year ago today, I resigned from my ten-year teaching career. I remember it well, mainly because it was the day of Trump's inauguration and I'd had no sleep the night before. I'd been planning on resigning later in the term (Benn and I had talked about me resigning the year before and agreed that the best time would be when D started school- no more nursery fees), but for some reason I found myself pouring out my thoughts to my line manager, who was amazingly supportive. I wrote my letter there and then, although I decided I would stay til the end of the year: this would give me time to sort myself out, but also I wanted to see my students through the year. 
 I then began to plan. I saved as much money (read: not much) as I could every month and joined agencies specialising in helping parents find work (spoiler: they were crap.) I spoke to people who could help me- one friend gave me really good advice about CVs. I researched, planned and saved. I'm not ashamed to admit that I was pretty terrified- I was leaving a job I'd done since I was 23, with relatively good money for the days I was in work (but not those I was working outside of school hours) and school holidays guaranteed. I had never looked for a job as a parent. Hell, I hadn't seriously looked for a new job in eight years. 
 The time went REALLY fast. I took the summer off and started looking for work the week after D started school. I wrote a skills-based CV, which showed what I could do (and is easier to adapt for the skills required by each job description.) I also narrowed down the sort of places I wanted to work- charities, public sector- and signed up for job alerts. I scoured job boards for the NHS, the council, universities and the civil service. I applied for three jobs and was offered interviews for them all (I accepted the second job and got excellent feedback from the first. I didn't attend the third interview.) I bought a basic black dress in the summer sales, which I wore with a plain cardigan (I felt like a younger Miss Marple, tbh), but it looked smart and presentable. 
 I was lucky in that I got a temp job for a few weeks, which brought in a bit of money, but I budgeted HARD. I cut all non-essential costs and used the library. During times when I wasn't working, I kept myself busy: looking after the sheep, learning French, going to a free weekly knitting group. 
 I started my job in the public sector in December and it's very different. I'm also working five days a week until the end of next month, which has brought a temporary boost in money but headaches with childcare. I'll be a lot less well-off once I go down to three days, but better in terms of health. I sleep better, I'm happier and Benn and D have noticed a huge difference. 
 I have had to deal with an odd side-effect though: losing a sense of identity that was tied up with my job. It's liberating and less scary now, but it's definitely taken a while. 
 For anyone looking to change lanes, I will tell you it's potentially hard- I was lucky that Benn was happy to pick up the slack, even if it means a change in lifestyle for us for a while- but the rewards can be utterly worth it.
