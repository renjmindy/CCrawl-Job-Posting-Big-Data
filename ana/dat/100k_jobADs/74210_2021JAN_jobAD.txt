 Gleeson HR are one of the leading HR teams in the Midlands. 
 We pride ourselves in providing an honest, credible and quality service, and we have some impressive success stories and client testimonials to support this. Our fundamental aim is to create a true partnership with businesses. This opportunity is an essential hire into our HR Recruitment team, and you will be working alongside market experts with decades of experience in recruiting the top HR talent. 
 We are looking for a motivated, enthusiastic and positive consultant with a strong work ethic and excellent communication skills. 
 Building a thorough understanding of the HR market is essential, so you must be confident speaking to and meeting candidates, attending client visits and networking extensively. Relationships are key to what we do; we are looking for someone who has the initiative, the discipline and the drive to build and develop their HR knowledge, and ultimately their market. Working with already established clients, you must be comfortable promoting the HR brand to warmer clients and cold calling new businesses to expand your network. 
 In this full 360 role, you will manage resourcing assignments from start to finish, lead on business development initiatives, and continue to promote and grow the HR brand in addition to opening up new accounts to the rest of the business. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
