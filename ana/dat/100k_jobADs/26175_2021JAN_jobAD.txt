  3 Interview Hacks That Will Help You Land The Job

 Interviewing is one of the most stressful aspects of the job search process. Waiting for a response for an interview from employers can take weeks. Not knowing how many others are interviewing for the same position as you can create even more stress. 
 
 Whether you are planning your job search now or preparing for your first interview ever, these hacks will help your chances of landing that dream job. 
 1. Always Research The Company Before The Interview 
 As they say, "Knowing is half the battle," the same applies for the job interview. Knowing the company's mission and  core values , knowing how market trends are affecting the company, and knowing who exactly are the company's competitors are all important hacks that will impress the employer at your interview. 
 Another key trick is to find out who is interviewing you and research that person on LinkedIn to know his/her career path and story. 
 In the job interview, don't be afraid to ask how your interviewer got to where they are today. Show interest.  Be curious.  Walk into the job interview with as much information under your belt as possible, and you'll be surprised by how much easier it is to answer questions—and ask them, too. 
 2. Dress For The Job You Want (Not The Job You Have) 
 It's true when they say that first impressions are everything. It's highly recommended that you arrive 15-20 minutes early for the interview, bring copies of your resume in a portfolio, and dress conservatively in clothing one level above what the current employees at the company are wearing. You want to look professional, but not like you don't fit in with the  workplace culture . 
 Most importantly, be engaging and enthusiastic during the interview. Remember that multiple people are interviewing for that same position and you want to convey that enthusiasm in your appearance, attitude, and energy. **By being enthusiastic, you'll be memorable —in a good way. ** 
 Don't forget to ask questions and send a thank you note to everyone you met at your job interview following the interview to reaffirm your enthusiasm. 
 3. Know Your Key Skills & Accomplishments 
 It's one thing to list your key skills and accomplishments on your resume, but it's another to be able to sell or market them in an interview.  Make sure you list your top skills and accomplishments on a piece of paper before you go into the interview, and be sure to convey how those skills are valuable for the company's goals/objectives, productivity, and profitability. 
 Most employers nowadays ask  behavioral interview questions . A great way to answer these questions while highlighting your skills and accomplishments is by using the Experience + Learn = Grow model and the STAR technique (situation, task, action, result). 
 What was the situation/problem? How did you solve this problem/overcome this setback? What did you learn from this experience? How did you apply what you learned to your career? 
 Whether you accomplished something great or developed a new skill, your interviewer will be impressed by your story and remember it long after you walk out the door. 
 
 Mastering these three hacks will help you ace your next job interview and increase your chances of scoring a spot with the company of your dreams. At the end of the day, preparation is key!
