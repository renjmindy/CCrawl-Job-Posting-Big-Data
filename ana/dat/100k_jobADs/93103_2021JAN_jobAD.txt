 Amid COVID-19 employment downturn, LinkedIn ranks in-demand jobs 
 Posted on  March 27, 2020  by  hotcountry921  in  Lakeshore News ,  News Around the World 
 While millions are out of work because of lockdowns, shutdowns, and other results from the COVID-19 pandemic, LinkedIn is looking into hiring trends overseas to try to predict what could happen on our shores. The site has also posted a list of the most in-demand positions right now, along with a list of who's hiring. 
 By looking at where the pandemic struck first, China, LinkedIn notes that the U.S. could expect to see a hiring downturn, "followed by a slow, but steady rebound as economies return to 'business as usual.'" 
 With no further ado, here's LinkedIn's list of in-demand jobs, and who's looking to get Americans back to work: 
 Store Associate 
System Operator 
Certified Public Accountant 
Healthcare Specialist 
Construction Worker 
Warehouse Manager 
Psychologist 
Vehicle Mechanic 
Academic Advisor 
Delivery Driver 
 Companies with the most open jobs: 
 7-Eleven 
Army National Guard 
KPMG 
Amazon 
Genentech 
Lowe’s 
HCA Healthcare 
Intuit 
Nepris 
Whole Foods 
 LinkedIn also learned that certain companies are stepping up hiring to meet demand in these times, like as grocery chains and delivery services like Kroger, Walmart, Amazon, and CVS. They've all signaled they want to put hundreds of thousands of people to work right away. 
 For example: 
 CVS: Hiring 50,000 workers to meet exploding demand at its stores. 
Pizza Hut: 30,000 permanent workers 
Walmart: about 150,000 temporary workers by the end of May 
Dollar Tree, which also owns Family Dollar, plans to hire 25,000 workers. 
7-Eleven: 20,000 new store employees. 
Amazon: 100,000 workers. 
Domino's: more than 10,000 workers. 
 As expected, the medical community is looking for as many health care providers as possible. New York City has even asked private and retired providers to help in hospitals. "More than 1,000 answered the call," the website noted.
