 <- My dilemma as a recruiter 
 Unknown, Unsung contributor! -> 
 Every employee is doing their job! 
 Posted on  30/03/2016  by  Sunny 
 A few weeks ago, I published  this post  that revealed a story of respecting different jobs equally. Today I want to discuss about the manner in which we insult the employees of other fields. 
 And this is mostly true for the jobs involving cold calling. Working as a recruiter gave me great insights into the insult felt when someone puts down your call with a BANG!!! Or just puts it aside without speaking any word. Or would start shouting “Hello, hello…” as if s/he can’t hear you! My colleagues, in these situations, often became very  angry. 
 What? Oh yes, I do agree. “He might truly be facing problem talking to you”, I too thought so. And that is why I used to call again. This time, s/he won’t even pick up my call. Actually, the moment we stated that we have called regarding a recruiter’s job (  in my case  ), credit card, insurance scheme, etc. – we often get to hear – BANG!!! 
 Yes, I understand you are busy! I understand you don’t have time! And I definitely understand you are not interested in the item, scheme or whatever is being offered. 
 But there is a way – a way to decline – a way to say NO – and a way to show you are not interested. The person offering the item to you is an employee and not your enemy or one whom YOU pay. S/He is just doing his/her job and has no interest in eating up your time except to show you the opportunity. Not interested? You say NO – in a proper manner! 
 I don't know why a lot of people are even scared of such calls. Probably they are not confident of being able to turn the offer down.  Insecurity - I think! 
 Consider your closest friend – or your LOVE/SPOUSE has recently joined a company as a tele-caller. And she calls you to as a last attempt to reach her target. Will you not talk? Will you not talk properly? And if not interested, will you not decline the offer in a decent manner - like a decent working professional? Just imagine that, and have some empathy for workers of any other field – not as worker but as humans. 
 What do you say? 
 Ok, that’s just one side of the coin! 
 Come back to read my next post where I will talk about the other side of the coin.
