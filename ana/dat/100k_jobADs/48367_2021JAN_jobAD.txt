 There's been a seismic shift in the job market since mid-March. More than 38 million people have lost their jobs and applied for unemployment benefits due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 What can these newly-jobless men and women do to get back in the workforce? 
 WorkingNation's Editor-in-Chief  Ramona Schindelheim  joined  Harriet Cole , host of Dreamleapers, on WBAI, to talk about the issue. They discussed specific programs that can help upskill the workforce and how that retraining will play an important role in the jobs recovery efforts in the months to come.
