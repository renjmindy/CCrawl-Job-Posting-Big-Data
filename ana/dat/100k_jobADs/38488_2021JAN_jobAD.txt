 Human Condition 
 Posted by  N. A. Diaman

 Vivere  directed by Francesca Archibugi (Italy) 2019 revolves around a modern middle class Italian family. 
 Ongoing challenges include economic realties and unfulfilled career aspirations as well as the fragile nature of personal relationships. 
 This family continues to live beyond its means by drawing on questionable familial resources and the tensions trigger frequent asthma attacks in its youngest member. 
 The sexual proclivities of the husband seem typical as are the reactions of the young Irish au pair, somewhat surprising in the current era of moral scrutiny drawing attention to ways men frequently take advantage of women. 
 Vivere  was one of the narrative features of the recently concluded Cinema Italian Style mini movie festival at the Vogue Theatre in San Francisco.
