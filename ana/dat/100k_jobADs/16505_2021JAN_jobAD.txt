 Positions with World Unite! 
 Working with World Unite! 
 Our worldwide World Unite! team currently consists of  58 key team members  (58% female and 42% male) of 20 different nationalities, speaking a total of 25 different languages. 
 We have an extremely low employee turnover - almost all team members who have decided to work with us have been staying with us so far. Therefore most vacant positions are new positions resulting from the growth of our organisation. As they are new position, it is often necessary for new team members "to grow into the role" and to define their exact responsibilities in interaction with the other team members - taking into consideration everyone's strenghts and interests. As opposed to larger organisations, we don't have strong hierarchies and very strict departmental separations of tasks and duties, and you should enjoy working in a fast-paced, "start up" work environment, helping out your colleagues where needed. Even though we are in our 13th year of operations and have become a relevant player in our sector, we have maintained our youthful energy, which is fostering innovation and providing space for professional and personal growth of our team members. 
 If you don't find any suitable positions advertised on this page, but you think you can be a valuable asset to our team, you can always email your resume and motivation letter to  Diese E-Mail-Adresse ist vor Spambots geschützt! Zur Anzeige muss JavaScript eingeschaltet sein!.

 >> German language teacher in Cochin/India 
 Available from: immediately 
 This position is with our partner language school in Fort Cochin/India that is looking for a teacher of German as a foreign language. 
 The institute offers courses at A1, A2, B1, B2 and C1 levels in German (From beginners to effective operational proficiency level). It prepares candidates for the Goethe and OSD exams. The institute provides only small group and one to one classes to ensure thorough learning and preparation for the exam, ranging from 5 to 10 students. The learning process, therefore, is intensive, progress rather fast and regular class attendance by all learners a must. At present there are 4 teachers from Germany at the institute. 
 The Language Institute gives primary importance to application of the living language and learners are immersed in the language as used by native speakers. In the initial stage, the main focus is on sounds and structures; more comprehensive vocabulary building only sets in after learners have come to grips with the basic principles of the language. 
 Studying a language is seen an active process that implies the student's involvement in all four competencies - reading, writing, listening and speaking. The institute uses state-of-the-art teaching methods and materials to make sure that the students become self-reliant learners and can independently develop their skills once they graduate from the institute. 
 The institute is looking for candidates who can teach German at the A-Levels. English skills are an advantage, as in the institute elementary German is mainly taught in English. You will be guided and assisted by experienced teachers. The institute offers safe accommodation and a reasonable stipend for Indian standards to cover your living expenses. You should be willing to stay for one year. 50% of a two way flight ticket can also be paid as part of the offer. 
 Besides German, French is offered at levels A1, A2 and B1 at the language institute. Dutch is offered at A1 level.
