  5 Things To Consider Before Quitting Your Job

 Quitting. It's a huge decision. It's also something all of us have considered at least once. Thinking about quitting your job? Before you make any rash decisions, you need to ask yourself a few very important questions. 
 
 The last thing you want to do is regret a major life move like quitting your job. 
 So, here are five things you should consider before quitting your job: 
 1. Have You Worked In That Job For Two Years? 
 What the heck is the two-year rule, and why does it matter? Well, typically, it takes a few months to train and get comfortable in a position. However, most people aren't just automatically great at their jobs. They need to take some time to hone their new skills and really provide value to the company before they can market those new skills toward another job. 
 Developing new skills  or building on current ones usually happens sometime during your first or second year at a job.  Spending less than two years at a job could hurt your career and give employers the impression that you're a job hopper .  But if the situation is dire, staying could be worse. 
 It's important to ask the following questions to better determine if quitting your job is the right career move for you. 
 2. Do You Have The Right Experience? 
 Have you built up enough experience so you can effectively market yourself for another role? You may need to stay a little longer so you can build that credibility and really hone those skills. That way, you'll have a better shot of getting that job you really want. 
 On your resume, the best way to get a hiring manager's attention (and  get your resume past the ATS ) is to quantify your skills and accomplishments.  So, ask yourself:   Can I quantify my work experience on my resume ? Or have I not accomplished enough at my current role? 
 If not, it's probably best for you to stay a bit longer at your job before quitting. Finish up that big project, or try to get as much experience as you can before the quarter ends. 
 3. Are You Overworked? 
 Are you feeling like things are getting a little out of control? Are you just burned out? If that's the case, you want to try to "reclaim" the job, as J.T. O'Donnell, founder and CEO of Work It Daily says.  Look for assistance, tools, and resources so you can take more control over your job and tasks. 
 If being  "overworked" is part of the workplace culture  at your job, then it could be time to quit, especially if it's negatively affecting your mental health and you've tried to make changes and you still feel burned out at work. Just make sure you ask about workplace culture in your future job interviews, so you don't accept a job offer at another company with the same overworking atmosphere. 
 4. Have You Tried To Energize The Role, Or Take It To The Next Level? 
 "Sometimes, we get bored," says O'Donnell. "We know the job like the back of our hand, it's easy, and we're looking for more of a challenge. So, you should be stepping up to the plate and ASKING for those responsibilities."  Instead of quitting your job, it might be a good time to leverage the skills you've learned. 
 Before asking for  a promotion , try asking your manager if there's anything you can take off their plate. Not only will this show initiative and make it easier for you to ask for a raise or promotion in the future, but it could help protect you from  getting laid off . 
 If your company is laying off employees, your manager might be more likely to vouch for you to the higher-ups, because if you're gone, your manager will have to go back to doing everything you took off their plate (and they don't want that). 
 5. Is There Something Else Going On? 
 Are you blaming work when it's really something going on in other areas of your life? Things like relationship issues or other challenges can cause extra stress.  If you're blaming your job for that extra stress, quitting is probably not your best option because that stress is just going to carry over to the next job. 
 It's better to resolve the issues that are happening outside of work before you  leave your job —if you decide that's still the right career move. 
 BONUS TIP: Be Careful 
 "If you choose to quit a job, don't do it without having another job lined up first," says O'Donnell. 
 According to O'Donnell, the average job search takes about nine months.  NINE! That's a long time to be without work. And, if you're looking for a management or  executive position , it could take much longer. 
 Think it through and make smart choices. If it's time to quit, you know what to do! 
 
 After asking yourself these five questions, you should have a good idea whether you should quit your job or stay put. Once you quit your job, there's no going back. Make sure you think long and hard about the decision, and be strategic about your exit. Your career will thank you!
