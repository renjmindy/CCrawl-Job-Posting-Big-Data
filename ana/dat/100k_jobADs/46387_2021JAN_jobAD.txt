  7 Unexpected Sources For Job Leads  
 Peggy McKee 
 April 12, 2016 
 If you’ve been job hunting for long, you’ve probably hit the online listings and maybe asked around your network. However, there are a few places you may not be thinking of that could be the source of the perfect job for you.  Related: How to Find Hidden Job Leads on the Go 
 
 Previous Bosses 
 When you’re in a job search, the smart move is to call every boss you’ve ever had. They probably won’t have a job for you, but they may have some great job leads. They know you, they know your work, and their network probably has a few names in it at a higher level than what you have access to. Their recommendation to some of those names might carry some helpful weight for you. If you haven’t kept a good relationship with your past bosses, now is a good time to mend those fences. If you’re not sure, chances are that they would be fine hearing from you and happy to help. See more about  calling your past boss in a job search. . 
 Previous Co-Workers 
 Hopefully, the people you’ve worked with in the past are in your current networking list. If not, add them now. Don’t just include people you directly worked with. Also think about who may have been in adjacent departments, support departments, other divisions, an so on. People in your career space will naturally hear about relevant job leads and can pass them on to you. If you’ve lost touch, try looking for them on LinkedIn. 
 Companies You’ve Interviewed With Before 
 If you interviewed with a company in the past, there was something about you they liked—even if they didn’t choose you to hire for that one position. If you contacted them now, they may have a job that’s a better fit, or they may be ready to hire you. If they don’t have a spot, they might know someone who does. If you interviewed with them, you’ll still have the contact information for the hiring manager there and maybe others. Use it to reach out now. 
 YouTube 
 You probably won’t find a job lead on YouTube, but you could generate one. Create and post a video resume, or create a video showcasing your skills or knowledge as a Subject Matter Expert. Make sure your video is good quality, because it will reflect on you. Everything you put online contributes to your personal brand and makes it easier for recruiters and hiring managers to find you. 
 Newspapers 
 Fewer companies these days post jobs in the classifieds, and fewer people read them; but some do post jobs, and you may have less competition for those jobs because readership has declined. What’s more important for you—the actual news. Keep your eyes peeled for headlines relating to companies in your space. Look for who’s expanding with new projects or acquisitions—that’s a clue they they’re probably also hiring. 
 Alumni Organizations 
 If you haven’t been active in your college alumni organization, now is the time to start. Many colleges have alumni groups in cities all over the country, and the people in them are loyal and ready to promote a fellow alumnus. Go to functions and talk to people. You never know who will be there, and where that relationship may lead. 
 Career Coaching 
 A  career coach  (not a life coach) can be a great path to a new job. Someone with knowledge of your field who can look at your resume, evaluate your interview performance, and show you how to best sell yourself in the job search can be a huge help to you.  Find out more about career coaching  and what it can do for you.
