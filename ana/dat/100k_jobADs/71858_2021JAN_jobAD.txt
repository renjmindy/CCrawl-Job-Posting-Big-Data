 Winches - Barges - Boats - Cranes - Vessel Chartering Services 
 ABOUT 
 I live in the Florida Panhandle and have been in the industrial-marine industry serving gulf coast customers for more than 40 years. My experience includes running our family shipyard in Louisiana with over 100 employees performing new construction, repair and barge cleaning and coating operations. 
 Today, I own several barges for charter and have access via my brokerage company to other vessels and equipment. I know the industry and its people and over the years we have made countless professional connections that are always looking for good quality marine vessels. I also own a 401 acre industrial facility with over three miles of water frontage for vessel storage. 
 So whether you’re looking to buy or sell, charter a tank or deck barge or are in need of fleeting services, give us a call. We are here to meet your needs. 
   Barge Charter Services 
 We have been arranging charters for over 40 years for inland and offshore vessels for either short-term or long-term charters. 
 We offer a wide range of services for ship/marine vessel owners, charterers, shipyards, investors, and other maritime brokers. Our services range from ship & marine vessel brokerage; barge charter services; new, rebuilt, & used winch sales; and marine consulting & vessel appraisal services. 
 We are proud to boast an excellent track record for selling vessels, barges, and winches located in the USA and abroad. We accept exclusive and non-exclusive listings for inland and offshore marine vessels, barges, winches, and associated equipment. When you list your assets exclusively with us, you can feel confident that our strategically- targeted marketing plan will result in a sale. 
 In addition to personally alerting our professional contacts, we also list your assets with popular trade publications such as Boats & Harbors, The Waterways Journal, and Marine News. We also advertise in Crane Market, Crane Trader and Oil Patch Surplus. But our efforts don’t stop there. We also use blitz marketing, social media and email campaigns to ensure that your asset is visible to qualified potential buyers. 
 Our rates are reasonable and due only upon the sale of your marine vessel or marine equipment.
