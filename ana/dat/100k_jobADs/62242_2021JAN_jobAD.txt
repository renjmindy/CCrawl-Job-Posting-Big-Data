 The Platform for all things GIF - need we say more? 
 Role overview 
 Weâ€™ve built the worldâ€™s largest animated GIF search engine and redefined how people search, discover, create, and share GIFs.

The GIPHY platform is the core infrastructure that powers both internal and external products including Giphy.com, GIPHY mobile apps, several major, native Social Media integrations, thousands of indie developer apps, our own API and more. Our public API services billions of requests and traffics many petabytes of media per month. 
 You'll be joining a wildly creative, fun and talented group of individuals who are passionate about building out the future of GIFs. We have big dreams and goals for 2018 and are looking for like-minded, skilled people to join us! 
 What you'll do 
 
 Design and develop available, performant services enabling millions of people to search for and create GIFs via public-facing APIs using  Scala  and its reactive platform. 
 Contribute to processes of development and deployment as GIPHY migrates it's platform to a  Scala-based   microservices  architecture. 
 Research and prototype new technologies to be introduced into our systems and infrastructure. 
 Collaborate with Product and Business Development to realize new products and features.

 Familiarity with *nix and its tooling 
 Sense of humor and love of GIFs

 Experience designing RESTful APIs
