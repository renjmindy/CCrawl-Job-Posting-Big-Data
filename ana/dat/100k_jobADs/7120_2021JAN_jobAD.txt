 Closed: Research Assistant Job 
 I'm hiring a research assistant (or possibly two) to work on my ARC-funded research project, _ Sparking a National Conversation . _ 
 The research assistant might contribute in a number of different ways to the project, but the right person might have one, two or all of these skill sets: 
 
 e-social science or big data skills 
 qualitative and interpretive skills 
 experience with research in indigenous Australian politics 
 an ability to grasp normative political theory and its empirical applications. 
 
 While I'm working with deliberative democratic frameworks, experience with that is not essential. What is essential is a completed or near-completed PhD in a related discipline - the post is going to demand a fair amount of autonomy and independent academic judgement, which may include co-authoring papers and help with a book manuscript. 
 Full details are available  here  - please feel free to share this widely. 
 UPDATE: Applications for this position closed on 5 August. Many thanks to all who shared this and all who expressed an interest.

 Hi John 
Hope you find someone inspirational – when you have happy to talk them through the lessons from our national conversations if it is helpful.
