 Basic book keeping and account management on a monthly basis 
 Published: 4 months ago  Bids: 3 
 I coach executives and travel quite a lot. There is a continual need to keep the accounts accurate and up to date. 
Particularly in the area of receipts for expenses. 
 The platform that I use is Xero. So experience and proficiency on this platform is a must-have. 
 If possible I'd like to be able to meet in person (preferable) or via video conference, say once every two weeks. 
To make sure things are ok. 
 The tasks to be performed on a monthly basis are as follows (expected monthly hours): 
- Checking account statements and updating records in Xero (4 hours) 
- General ledger and monthly Balance Sheet and Income statement (4 hours) 
- Invoicing for clients, issuing receipts, and tracking payments. (3 hours) 
- Account Management and Analysis, creating a monthly visual report based on this information for me to take action. (4 hours) 
- Biweekly meetings to check progress (2 hours) 
 The idea is for this to be a long term project to be renewed on a monthly basis.
