 Campground Job Tips: More Tips for Campground and RV Park Workers 
 Campground job tips are the seeming little things that make a big difference in whether your campground and RV park work is a good experience or a bad one. Life hacks for campground workers! 
 Campground Job Tips: 
 ~~ Check the time zones before making phone calls. If you are on the east coast and call an employer on the west coast, at 10:00 a.m. your time, it is only 7:00 a.m. his time. And, if you are in a western state and make an evening call at 9:00 pm your time, you are calling the employer who lives in an eastern state at midnight! 
 ~~ If you want to make extra money while working at a campground, consider pet sitting or dog walking. 
 ~~ When you talk to a prospective employer, do it on a speaker phone so you and your partner can both hear and respond. 
 Make Your Campground Job Better with These Tips 
 ~~ Go into the campground job with a positive attitude. This campground job tip is essential to your success! 
 ~~ Ask about the campground's clientele. Do they cater to young families with children or retired seniors? Are most of the sites for seasonal or long term renters, or is it a stop-over park where most guests only stay a night or two? 
 ~~ When a help wanted ad or job offer indicates that a full hook-up (FHU) site is included, it typically means that the site has water, sewer, and electrical hook-ups. It does not necessarily mean that the campground is going to pay your cost for using them. Similarly, Cable TV, WiFi, or a landline telephone hook-up may be available at the site, but you cannot safely assume you can use them without an additional charge. 
 Campground Job Tips Can Help You Find the Right Campground for You 
 ~~ There is no such thing as a "standard" number of hours to work in exchange for an RV site. 
 ~~ Contact your accountant or tax expert to see which of your expenses are legal tax deductions. Ask about deducting such things as travel expenses, cost of special clothing, tools you use on the job, and other job related expenditures. 
 ~~ Pay to stay at a campground before you accept a job there. That will give you a good idea of how current staff and management treat customers. It will allow you to get a "feel" for the park. I've been working with RVers for over 25 years, and this is what I consider the most important of all campground job tips. Following this one tip can save you thousands of dollars, thousands of miles of rushed travel, and prevent huge amounts of frustration. 
 ~~ Double-check the contact information you put on your resume and in your emails. A campground owner cannot hire you if he can't get a hold of you. If you don't follow this campground job tip, you won't get the position. 
 ~~ If you respond to a help wanted ad and don't hear back within a couple of days, do a follow-up contact. 
 ~~ If you respond to a help wanted ad, and don't hear back, even after you have followed up multiple times, accept that you are not being considered for the position. (Some campground tips aren't what you want to hear. But it is best to accept it and look onward for another position.) 
 Find Great Campground Jobs for You with These Tips 
 ~~ Bartering isn't always your best deal. You may be better off to work for an hourly wage and pay the regular price for your RV site. 
 ~~ Before accepting a campground job, find out when you are expected to be on-site. There may be a requirement that you are at the campground certain times of the day, or certain days of the week, even if you are not scheduled to perform a specific duty during those times. 
 ~~ Combine an RV-home business with your camp host job. It may provide you with extremely beneficial, legal income tax deductions. 
 ~~ How many hours you should work in exchange for your RV site is totally up to you. It depends on how many hours you are willing to work without feeling the campground owner is taking advantage of you. 
 Campground and RV park jobs vary so much, that you cannot safely make assumptions. Ask questions. Ask for clarification. Use these campground job tips to make your work experience a good one.
