 bogged, buried, bridgewatered-Lois E. Linkens & Henna Sjöblom 
 I was fourteen, and starting to decompose faster 
 the water spilled 
 over the years, 
 over her body 
 like a plague of ants. 
 Already kneeling in the mud 
 I could feel my body being stretched out 
 nipples aching, labia swelling 
 it drove its way in, 
 with a silent battering ram 
 and swords of silk. 
 you were the first time 
 I felt the touch of death 
 between my legs 
 oh, hateful – 
but grateful she was 
that the stone struck when it did. 
 a cry of despair, 
like when I was nine, 
lying on the hard parquet floor of the living room 
cupping my breasts, 
trying to push the knots back in 
I’m just a child! I’m just a child! 
 she lifted dead hands 
in praise of her protector, 
for protect her he had, 
and as layers of dirt built up, 
 I threw rocks after boys 
who came yelling my name 
 she pitied them, 
 Leave me alone! Leave me alone! 
And oh, 
didn’t you know? 
You’re supposed to bleed 
 bound to lie 
in pungent darkness 
that she only made danker. 
 Year by year, 
as my body sank down in the bog 
I grew more and more desperate 
searching for ways to cleanse myself 
an orgasm, 
a reckless mascara plump on the cheek, 
a slit wrist, 
an aching need 
for affirmation 
the summary of an entire childhood, 
tucked into a bra 
 the sores on her skin 
filled with soil, 
 all girly things are good, 
 the scars on her arms 
 bright in the black of the bog 
 all girls to learn how to play nicely 
 how to decay without a sound 
 compressing yourself into a fossilized smile, 
 a blindfold 
 and a constantly repeating 
 “yes, I forgive you” 
 This was originally published by the Sudden Denouement Literary Collective. 
 
 Lois  describes herself as a “confused english student,” though one quickly finds a polished, charming poet in her work. She has an elegant style that compliments her keen insight and whimsical sensibilities. You can read more of her work at her self-titled  blog . 
 Murder Tramp Birthday  , previously Malicia Frost, dropped the disguise and is now publishing under her real name Henna Sjöblom. A hobbyist writer and an aspiring novelist from Finland, she enjoys surrealism, sci-fi and horror, and her works often deal with mental illness. More of her works can be found at her  Murder Tramp Birthday .
