  4 Tips To Using Twitter As A Job Seeker  
 Don Goodman 
 September 01, 2016 
 Where are you looking for job opportunities?  Most job seekers who are current with the times will tell you they’re looking at online job boards and focusing most of their time on social media sites like LinkedIn. Those who understand the value of social media for job searching and job networking will also tell you they are finding job opportunities on Twitter. 
 (Psst! Can’t get hired?  Watch this free tutorial .) 
 
 To job search effectively today, you need to be in direct contact and communication with the individuals who can help open the doors to a job interview. Simply applying to a job opening by sending an email to the general HR inbox or clicking submit through the job board, and then waiting for a response just isn’t effective anymore. Clearly, there is a lot of information on how LinkedIn has helped job seekers make connections with professional contacts and prospective employers, but when it comes to Twitter, it’s not as clear – how can a tweet running 140-character or less help your job search? Find clarity on how you can also use Twitter for job searching with the tips below: 
 1. Establish a professional and relevant Twitter handle. 
 For those of you who are not familiar with me, resume writing, career advice and job search strategies is where my expertise lies. A Twitter handle using my name won’t say much, but my Twitter handle of  @JobExpert  surely gives you a better understanding. As a job seeker, you have to apply the same approach. Base it on your location and profession or other relevant terms used in your field of work to help attract prospective employers and immediately inform them what you’re all about. It’s similar to what you have to do on LinkedIn with your Headline. You can find tips to improving your LinkedIn Headline, reading:  “3 Ways to Improve Your LinkedIn Headline.” 
 2. Help others discover you. 
 It doesn’t take much to get your name and information out on Twitter. Simply publishing articles or posts you write online or share your online portfolio and website with some relevant hashtags. It’ll immediately get others to take notice of you. 
 3. Follow contacts and employers who you want to work with. 
 One of the easiest ways to stay informed about new job openings is by following employers you want to work with as well as contacts who are well-connected with the employer, or recruiters on Twitter. You can also do a general search for recruiters who specialize in your area. Conduct a search using different combinations like “Accounting jobs NYC” etc. An alternative to this is going to CareerArc (formerly known as TweetMyJobs.com). 
 4. Keep informed about target employers. 
 When you stay on top of target employers, you are informed about upcoming meetings and conferences they’ll have a presence at. These upcoming events may very well be opportunities where you can conjure up conversation with appropriate contacts to pave the way to job opportunities. These basic tips to using Twitter will help open many more opportunities in your job search.
