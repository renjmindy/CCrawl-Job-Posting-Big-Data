 Unova is a complete enterprise solution that connects your internal system with blockchain technology to measure and record information about every step of your supply chain. This allows us to create trust between parties that donâ€™t trust each other while at the same time solving many problems that exist within different supply chains. This is made possible by giving the multiple parties access to currently unshared or unused data. How cool is that! We are on a mission to set a global standard for decentralized supply chain management. This will allow us to provide quality assurance, eliminate waste & inefficiencies and improve processes & products. Are you willing to create an impact with us on an entire supply chain? Letâ€™s create the Unova Blockchain Ecosystem together. Ps for more information check our website https://unova.io/
