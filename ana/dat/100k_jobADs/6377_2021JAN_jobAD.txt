 You can earn rewards by completing simple tasks like watching entertaining videos, shopping online, searching the web, answering surveys and playing games. 
 For completing these tasks, you earn points, called SBs, which you can then redeem for PayPal cash or gift cards. 
 Paid surveys are the most lucrative way to make money on Swagbucks, where you can expect to earn about $2 to $3.50 per survey. You also get a $10 sign up bonus just for joining.

 Survey Junkie 
 
 Paid surveys are one of the easiest online jobs that pay through PayPal and Survey Junkie is one of the best survey sites out there. 
 They have a good reputation among users and their minimum payment threshold ($10) is relatively low compared to most other survey panels. They also pay $2-$75 per completed survey. 
 The way that Survey Junkie works is you earn points for every survey you complete. You can then redeem your points for PayPal cash or other gifts. 
 Every 100 points equal $1 and you can cash out once you accumulate 1000 points ($10). 
 Here’s how to earn your first $1 in 5 minutes:

 Businesses, entrepreneurs and individuals come here to buy services of all kinds, including graphic design, writing, marketing, video creation, programming and much more. 
 When it started out, freelancers would make $5 each time they offered a service or gig. But these days you can make a lot more than just $5. 
 If you have a skill that other people may find valuable, then Fiverr might be the perfect place for you to make money online. 
 InboxDollars

 MusicXray 
 Another easy online job opportunity that pays you through PayPal is  MusicXray , a pretty cool website especially if you're into music. 
 How MusicXray works is they have legitimate music companies and industry professionals who come here to promote certain types of music. 
 As a music fan, you'll then listen to the music and give a good honest opinion as to what they think about the song. 
 By doing this, you'll be giving them valuable information that lets them know whether or not this is a song that they can push on radio or on other music platforms. 
 The process is really simple. You sign up, music arrives in your inbox, you listen to it, give your review, and then you get paid. 
 There's a pretty good diverse amount of music that you can listen to and it's a cool way to support the musicians that really inspire you. 
 Once you accrue $20 or more in your MusicXray account, you can request a payout to your PayPal.

 Lots of people go to Upwork to outsource work, and you can find gigs in virtually any field; whether it's writing, web development, graphic design, proofreading, law, engineering, human resource, you name it. 
 If you're just starting out, you may not make as much money but once you figure out how it works, you can make a pretty decent amount. 
 I personally use Upwork and I've made some  extra money working from home on there . You can  see my Upwork profile here .

 Humanatic 
 Humanatic  is a website where you can get paid to review calls. I'm sure you've probably called one of this big companies before and got a little automated service that tells you "this call is going to be recorded for quality purposes." This is kind of what you'll be doing here. 
 You will listen to the recorded calls and then answer a few simple questions as to how the process worked, if it worked well, if it seemed like the person on the call did what they were supposed to with their job, etc. You get paid by doing this sort of thing. 
 The amount of money you can make varies depending on your skill and accuracy but you can expect to earn anywhere between $1 to $5. 
 It's a little bit on the low end as to how much money you can make with this but it's still a way to earn some money online just by listening to phone calls. 
 Konker 
 Konker  is a digital services marketplace that focuses on gigs related to internet marketing. 
 It's similar to Fiverr, but you can only sell services such as graphic design, SEO, video creation, social media gigs and anything else people might need in the digital marketing space. 
 Konker is easy to use and can be a pretty quick way to make money online selling your skills since it's set up in such a way that you receive payments in your Paypal immediately after making a sale. 
 Rev 
 Another option for online jobs that pay through PayPal is  Rev.com , a transcription company where people go to have their audios or videos converted to text. 
 Depending on what you're interested in doing, you can earn money with Rev as a transcriptionist, captioner, subtitler or translator. 
 They pay pretty decently. You can earn anywhere from $29 to $39 per transcribed hour. The payouts are weekly via PayPal. 
 MindSwarms 
 MindSwarms  offers a pretty interesting way in which you can make money online and get paid through PayPal. 
 The way it works is you take mobile video surveys and get paid for it. 
 The reason why they want you to do mobile video surveys is because they want to actually see your facial expressions and gestures as you respond. 
 Participants get paid $50 via PayPal for every study completed. 
 UserTesting 
 UserTesting.com  is one of those really interesting websites to earn cash online. 
 How it works is people create brand new websites or apps and go there to have other people look at the sites and see if they're user friendly. 
 As a tester, you go through the site (you basically put on a headset) and record what you're going through while browsing the site. 
 They then ask you to answer some questions or maybe find something on the website and describe whether or not it was easy to find it. 
 They want you to be critical so that they can make the user experience on the website as easy as possible. 
 You get paid around $10 per test, which can take anywhere between 15 to 25 mins. 
 For the most part you can get 2 or 3 of these tests done in an hour and get paid anywhere from $20 to $30 an hour. 
 Postloop 
 Postloop  is a service where you can earn money by posting or commenting on blogs or forums. 
 Basically the idea here is that people who have blogs and forums or who create YouTube videos go to Postloop and pay for people to come to their sites and interact with the people on there to try to make it seem like it's a lot bigger and a lot more active than it really is. 
 When you post at somebody else's forum, you gain points that you can redeem for PayPal cash. 
 According to information on the Postloop site, posters receive $0.07 per post on average. 
 FeaturePoints 
 FeaturePoints  is one of those websites where they have different applications (for both Android and iPhone) that they want you to try on your phone or tablet. 
 You download the app and then you try it for whatever amount of time they request of you. 
 Once you do that, you accrue points that you can redeem for PayPal cash or other kinds of rewards such as Amazon gift cards. 
 They also offer an option to earn points by completing surveys or by shopping at your favorite stores through the FeaturePoints website. 
 BestReviewApp 
 BestReviewApp is an app promotion service where developers go to buy ratings and reviews for their apps. 
 It's a similar site to FeaturePoints, with the difference being that they want you to download an app and then write a review within 24 hours of receiving it. 
 You earn cash for every verified review you complete. The pay is $0.50 for reviewing a free app and $1.00-$1.50 for a paid one, but you are required to purchase any paid apps yourself upfront. 
 Payments will be sent to your PayPal every Friday. 
 MyAppAware 
 MyAppAware is another online earning opportunity where you can get paid to write app reviews. 
 They claim to pay $1 to $2 for every honest app review you write, and you can also earn $3 by playing and testing iPhone apps.
