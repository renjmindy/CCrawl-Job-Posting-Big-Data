 When Witchcraft is a Job 
 On  September 28, 2019  By  thornthewitch In  General Life Stuff ,  Wicca 
 I've struggled with this in the past, especially when work gets rough. Wouldn't it be great to just make a living as an author and blogger? Or maybe be a witchy influencer, because that's a  thing  now. 
 And that's fine for some people, but here I reflect on how my day job-even when it's crappy-actually informs my witchcraft and keeps it sacred.

 One thought on "When Witchcraft is a Job"

 Personally I prefer not to turn my spirituality into a job — imho, and in my experience, that’s the best way to get spiritual burnout.
