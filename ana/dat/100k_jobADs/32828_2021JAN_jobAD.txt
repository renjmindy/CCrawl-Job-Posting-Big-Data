 Ferrari Italian Job Tour 
 
 Went down to the Italian Job in Italy via the old circuit at Reims, the champagne region and through the Mont Blanc tunnel. There were a few mechanical maladies along the way which resulted in a hired 355 Spider being replace by a TVR Tuscan which we made in to an honourary Ferrari! 
 Stayed at Lake Orta on the way down and Chateau d'Etoges near Epernay on the way back. A fabulous trip with great company.
