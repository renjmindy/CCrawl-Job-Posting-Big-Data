Woodstock School, Mussoorie, India 
 Sarah P’s comments  : This position was posted two years. Woodstock is a well-established boarding school located in a remote area and might not be a good fit for those who enjoy city life. The school is well-established however and the reviews are positive overall (see  International School Reviews  for specifics). This position is offered through  Teacher Horizons , a free recruiting agency I have written about before:  my blog post . 
 Woodstock School  is seeking a  Librarian  to join their team **** in  July 2018. 
The ideal candidate will have a Bachelors of Library and Information Studies or equivalent, five years’ experience in a school or academic library and at least two years’ experience in an international multicultural setting.  Click here to view the full job description .
