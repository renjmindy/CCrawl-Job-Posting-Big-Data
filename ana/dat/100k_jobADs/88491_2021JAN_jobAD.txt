  6 Strategies For Surviving In A Job You Hate  
 Teena Rose 
 November 21, 2016 
 How do you survive in a job you hate? All of us have been there at some point. Out of necessity, you are stuck in a job that is unbearable - and as a result, you hate life. This is all-too-common in the U.S., where workers are often treated as commodities and liabilities, and get almost no real respect.  QUIZ:   Should You Quit Your Job?  Unfortunately, under current conditions few have the luxury of simply quitting, so here are several strategies for coping in a job you just can't stomach. 
 
 1. Set Goals And Objectives 
 If there is a bright side to your situation, it's easier to get a job if you already have one. This means that if you are in a job you hate, you're in a better position to get something better. Set a goal every week for sending out X number of resumes and attending a networking event or job fair. Such actions will help you to see a light at the end of the tunnel (which won't be New Jersey). 
 2. Set Aside Time For Yourself 
 If you are overscheduled and harassed, you'll be making a bad thing worse. It is vital to set some time aside each day, particularly before heading into work. It's also helpful to engage in some activity that brings a smile to your face, whether it's reading the latest Facebook posts, treating yourself to a favorite snack, or playing your favorite music on the stereo. 
 3. Create Diversions 
 If possible, fill your workspace and/or your day with small diversions. For example, an inside sales representative who sometimes dislikes making "cold calls" to prospective clients might bring a joke book to work and make it a point to read something funny before picking up the phone. It made a great deal of difference when it came to talk to people. 
 4. Learn New Tricks 
 If you don't have the job you want, it may be due to a lack of skills and/or knowledge. Fortunately, this is highly curable. It's never too late to learn something new that may make you more marketable when a new and better opportunity comes along. Are $$$'s in short supply? Is free better? The Internet has a treasure-trove of free seminars and webinars to help you build your education. Also, make use of your local library. Many carry new how-to DVD's relative to improving your personal and professional skills (i.e. coaching yourself to success, dealing with management issues, and time management). 
 5. Decompress 
 Failing to "blow off steam" and letting frustrations build up can be dangerous not only to yourself but to others as well. Continuous physical exercise is a great tension reliever, obviously, but also don't overlook fun activities such as softball, bowling, and dancing. Or, a leisure walk at a local park can go a long way towards depressurizing and maintaining a positive outlook. 
 6. Keep On Keepin' On 
 Anything worth doing at all is worth doing well - even if it's something you hate. Not only will this give you a sense of accomplishment and pride in yourself, it can also help you down the road should you need a reference.  This post was originally published at an earlier date.
