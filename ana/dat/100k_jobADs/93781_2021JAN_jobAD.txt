 I am a registered caregiver here in the Philippines. I wish to apply as a caregiver in Israel,is there any minimum age of working there? Because I'm only 22 years of age. I'm trained for child care, elderly care and household management. You can email me if the position is still available. And I want to know the basic salary for caregiver in Israel. Thanks a lot.
