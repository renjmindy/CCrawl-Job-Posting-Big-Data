 Anonymous Takes on the KKK in Ferguson …. "#OpKKK"!!

 From a report via Newsweek 
 Members of the self-styled tech-revolution group Anonymous have apparently seized control of several Twitter accounts and websites belonging to members of the Ku Klux Klan in retaliation for threats made against protesters in Ferguson, Missouri. 
 The group of so-called hacktivists has successfully targeted websites belonging to such organizations as the Church of Scientology, the government of Zimbabwe and corporate sites belonging to Visa, MasterCard and PayPal in the past. 
 
 The hackjob, given the hashtag  #OpKKK  by the group, began Sunday on as the first part of a two-part “op,” as Anonymous calls its hacking activities. The second part, called  #HoodsOff  , involves the “doxing” of KKK members in and around St. Louis. 
 In its typically over the top style, Anonymous announced the attack with a YouTube video. “We are not attacking you because of what you believe in, as we fight for freedom of speech,” the video says. “We are attacking you because of your threats to use lethal force against us at the Ferguson protests.”

 This spat between Anonymous and the Klan comes as Ferguson is on edge, just emerging from months of intense, racially charged protests following the shooting death of Brown by Wilson. The grand jury tasked with deciding whether Wilson will face criminal charges shooting is expected to announce its decision sometime this week. 
 
 ANONYMOUS Vs Ku Klux Klan #OpKKK 
 Published on Nov 16, 2014 
 " KKK it has came to our unfortunate attention that you have been interfering with Anonymous. 
 We are not attacking you because of what you believe in as we fight for freedom of speech. We are attacking you because of what you did to our brothers and sisters at the Ferguson protest on the 12th of November. 
 _Due to your actions we have started Operation KKK. The aim of our operation is nothing more than  Cyber   Warfare . Anything you upload will be taken down, anything you use to promote the KKK will be shut down. _ DDos attacks have already been sent and have infiltrated your servers over the past 2 days. d0x 's have also been launched on leaders of the KKK. All information retrieved will be given to the public. 
 You messed with our family and now we will mess with yours. 
 Let the cyber war begin. 
 We are legion. 
 We do not forgive 
 We do not forget 
 Ku Klux Klan you should have expect us. "

 I'm originally from Puerto Rico. I was born in Santurce and raised in Rio Piedras. I currently live in Florida - since 1999. I have a doctorate degree in Medicine; completed in 1976. My Internal Medicine specialty was completed in 1979. Worked for Puerto Rico's health system until 1985. At this time, I'm happily retired after working for the federal government for almost 28yrs. I also worked for the government of Puerto Rico from 1979 through 1985 .... for a total of almost 40 years as a physician. I want to offer any knowledge that I have to anyone "out there" who is interested. My views are liberal in almost every sense. My knowledge is "eclectic" - a bit of everything. Music and reading are my passion. Blogging has also become a very interesting endeavor. Metaphysical topics attract me. I'm interested in news - reporting human issues like injustice, discrimination and abuse - the "wrongly" affected. My intention is to bring this knowledge to an understandable level and to help anyone in need. I'm open to questions and will answer them to the best of my ability. Currently working on an enterprise whose main mission will be to bring peoples of all walks of life together. To be one .... since we ALL are ONE!! The future looks bright and promising!!!
