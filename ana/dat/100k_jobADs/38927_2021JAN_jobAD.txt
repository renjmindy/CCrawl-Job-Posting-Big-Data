 Our mission 
 To bring you truly unique online experiences from Hosts around the world, whilst giving back to communities where they grew up. 
 We believe that no matter your walk of life, each and everyone one of us deserves a platform to pursue one's passion. That is why, we promise to donate 25% of our profits to grassroots projects that help people in less privileged communities have a chance at pursuing their passion, something we all often take for granted. Today, we work with one amazing charity partner in Kenya, Charity Connect. 
 Our business today 
 We launched our marketplace platform in Public Beta earlier this month with a handful of Hosts. Our platform is bootstrapped and we do rely on 3rd party services such as Eventbrite and Zoom. This has allowed us to accelerate our time to market, start facilitating paid bookings, and host our first set of live experiences. 
 As we look ahead to 2021, one of our key priorities is to reduce our reliance on these 3rd party services and take back control of our own destiny. 
 What we 're looking for in our CTO 
 We are always looking for new and creative ways to support our Hosts and Guests. On the demand-side (Guests), we want to improve the discoverability of our experiences and reduce friction in booking and paying online. On the supply-side (Hosts), we want to offer Hosts a new set of tools and services that can further empower and support them with their primary goal: being able to earn a living from their passion. 
 We have already kick-started work on the new platform with our part-time Engineer. The tech stack we are using is React, Node.js, AWS, MongoDB, and Twillo. We are looking for a partner who can help us establish the right tech foundations that can scale as we grow both our supply-side and our demand-side. 
 If you want to play a part in bringing our mission to life and fancy joining an early-stage start-up on a part-time/or full-time basis, then we'd love to hear from you! 
 At this stage, we can offer equity-only (5%-15%). Our aim is to start fundraising from Q1 2021.
