 AnyJunk is reinventing rubbish clearance with technology. Voted one of the UK‚Äôs 100 most exciting, fast-growth companies and voted ‚ÄòUK Business of the Year 2017‚Äò by the British Chambers of Commerce. Founded by Jason Mohr, a former investment banker, who quit the City to revolutionise the junk removal sector. Starting from a single truck (Jason worked on it for the first 6 months), we now undertake up to 400 clearances per day. Operating Model We partner with established waste collection and skip hire companies all over the UK. Our digital platform offers them optional work to suit their capacity and proximity and allows us to closely monitor service levels, track where the waste is disposed, and keep customers updated in real time. This unique model means our reliability, speed of response and average miles per collection are dramatically better than traditional operators. We are using technology to leverage existing infrastructure efficiently ‚Äì rather than adding trucks and congestion to the roads ‚Äì and we‚Äôre helping local entrepreneurs (our waste carriers) grow and develop too. Mission Our mission is to be the first choice for getting rid of stuff that‚Äôs too big for the bin ‚Äì based on value for money, peace of mind, and ease of use. Values Whatever we do, we aim to stay true to our five Core Values: Happy teams make happy customers Open & Honest ‚Äì the opposite of a faceless corporate Responsible & Safe ‚Äì in how we operate and how we dispose of waste Service to proud of ‚Äì every job and every day Innovating & improving ‚Äì it should always feel we are getting better White Elephant Logo We chose our logo because elephants are lovable, big guys that can lift stuff and because of the expression ‚Äòwhite elephant stall‚Äô ‚Äì which is a local, green and cost-effective way of getting rid of things you no longer want. Just like us.
