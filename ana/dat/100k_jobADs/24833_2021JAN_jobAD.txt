  6 Reasons Why Your Resume Isn't Getting A Response  
 Jessica Holbrook Hernandez 
 Jenna Arcand 
 January 13, 2021 
   
 It can be hard to ascertain if it's your resume, the job market, or who knows what else when you're job hunting and your phone just isn't ringing. Your mind begins to wander as you anxiously await an employer's call or email. 
 Many job seekers have called us and said, “I think it's my resume, but I'm not sure." After reviewing their documents, we find ourselves telling them, "Yes, it's your resume," 99% of the time. So, how do you know if it's really your resume or if it's something else? Take a look at these six mistakes job seekers make on their resumes, and if one or more of them can be found on yours, that's probably why your resume isn't getting a response. 
 1. It Still Has An Objective Statement 
 An objective statement is a section of a resume that expresses your goal of securing a future position. What this statement fails to do, though, is substantiate your fit for the job opening—or articulate the value you offer the employer should they choose you over another candidate. Ditch the objective statement and utilize a  personal branding statement  and experience summary instead. An experience summary is a list of skills you have that are needed for the job you're applying for. They're hard skills and transferable skills, not soft skills. By having an objective statement on your resume, you're missing out on the opportunity to start proving your value to the employer within the first few seconds they glance at your resume, which is exactly the purpose of a personal branding statement and experience summary. 
 2. It Lacks Any Form Of Personal Branding 
 When employers read a resume, they need to see what attributes you bring to the position. It helps them differentiate between you and other viable candidates. Are you deadline-driven and customer-focused? These are important to employers and how they operate business. What is it that's important to the employer from whom you're seeking to obtain employment? And how do your expertise and experience correlate to their greatest need? Personal branding  is about how you market yourself to the potential employer. They have a need to fill, and you have to figure out how who you are and what you offer meet that need—then effectively communicate that to the employer. If you can't meet a need, then they won't see the value in choosing you over another candidate who does. 
 3. It's Fluffy 
 Your career summary and work history is  full of fluff  and filler words that could apply to every job seeker on the market. Here's an example of what we mean: Dynamic, results-focused IT specialist with broad-based expertise in project oversight, systems implementation, process improvements, and integrating cutting-edge technology that exceeds expectations. Proven ability to quickly analyze key business drivers and work directly with internal/external staff, leveraging a team-centered effort that increases profitability. Sure, it might sound good, but it hasn't told us anything specific about who this candidate is, their experience/expertise, and what they offer the employer. It would be better to address how many projects the candidate has overseen, which processes they improved, the outcome of the improvement, and how the cutting-edge technology they integrated exceeded expectations. But just saying they exceed expectations is vague; tell us which expectations were exceeded and by how much. 
 4. Skills & Accomplishments Are Not Highlighted 
 The top third of your resume is the most important section when the hiring manager is giving it his or her initial scan. This is your prime opportunity to market your skills and achievements. Remember the experience summary we mentioned above? That's where you'll write the  skills you possess  that are needed to succeed in this particular job.  Highlighting your skills in the experience summary will draw the hiring manager in, and entice them to keep reading. Then, as their eyes move down your resume, they'll see all of your accomplishments underneath your work history. What career successes are you most proud of that correlate to the job you're applying for?  
 5. Duties And Responsibilities Have Taken Over 
 Bullet points that only share basic duties and responsibilities fall short every time. Maximize the space on  your resume  by using the STAR method (situation, task, action, result). Talk about challenges you faced, how you addressed them, and what the outcomes were. This makes the information contained within your resume much more impactful. 
 6. Metrics, Facts, And Figures Are Nowhere To Be Found 
 Give the employer something to remember you by. Don't just tell them you reduced costs. State a percentage or dollar amount. Manage projects or clients? Put a number to it. Ask yourself questions like how much, how many, for how long? This is how you  quantify your work experience on your resume . It's the secret to getting a call from an employer.  Asking yourself questions like these leads to answers that help you define your successes, develop your personal brand, and market yourself more effectively to potential employers. 
 Review your resume with the six points above in mind. Ask yourself if your resume reflects any of the above. If it does, then use the tips and advice we've provided to correct the issues within your resume—and ultimately improve its response rate.  Need more resume help? We're here for you!

  6 Tips To Make Your Resume Better Than The Rest  
 Kitty Boitnott 
 Jenna Arcand 
 January 07, 2021 
   
 Recruiters look at dozens of resumes a day. If they see something they don't like, your resume could wind up in the “no" pile in just seconds. 
 Here are a few tips you should follow to make your resume better than the rest, standing out from all that competition! 
 1. Make Sure Your Resume Is Error-Free 
 We know that sounds like a no-brainer, but you might be surprised by the number of resumes that have a spacing issue, a punctuation error, or even a misspelling. The problem is that you have looked at your resume so many times, your brain knows what it is supposed to say, but in reality, it says something else. Get several people to  proofread your resume , and have them read it for different purposes. One person should read for grammar, for example, and another should read for punctuation and spelling. You cannot afford to send a resume to employers with mistakes. Any superficial error can severely hurt your chances of getting a call for that job. 
 2. Align Your Resume With The Description Of The Job You're Applying For 
 Too often people think that their resume is a "one and done" proposition. Not so! You should customize your resume for every job each time you apply. Match up keywords from the job description with keywords in your resume. Make sure that your achievements and successes indicate that you are an excellent candidate for  the job you're applying for . You need to tweak your resume for every single job posting. There are no exceptions.  
 3. Make Your Resume Sleek 
 Some people think the trick to a great resume is to stuff as many accomplishments as possible into it by using tiny font and stretching the margins to the limit. The result is a resume that is difficult to read and looks cluttered and clunky. Those resumes will wind up in the "no" pile because the  hiring manager  doesn't care enough to search the document for truly relevant information. They also don't have time to waste when there are dozens of other resumes to review.  Your resume should have a clean and contemporary look and feel. Use lots of white space and be as concise as possible. Also, use clean-looking fonts like Calibri or Arial. 
 4. Use Keywords Strategically 
 Check the job description carefully for each position you're applying for. Then, use keywords in your resume that match keywords in the job description. Also, you may find it helpful to use free word cloud tools to identify the keywords that are used most frequently in the job description. Adding those keywords to your resume will make it easier for you to  get your resume past the ATS .  Recruiters and hiring managers are looking for individuals who are a good match for their job opening. Don't make them guess whether or not you have the required skills or experience. Your resume should get them curious to know more about your qualifications. At the end of the day, the goal of your resume is to get the employer to call you. It won't be the thing that gets you the job, but it will be what gets you an interview.  
 5. Describe Accomplishments, Not Responsibilities 
 Avoid using the word "responsible" in your resume. Instead, concentrate on specific and  quantifiable accomplishments . For example, which sounds more impressive: Responsible for manufacturing production with proven record of exceeding expectations. Managed five different teams over the course of 10+ years resulting in $50 million in new sales along with a 30% reduction in waste. If you said the second bullet point, you picked the right one. That's what hiring managers are looking for on a resume. 
 6. Use "Power" Words 
 Demonstrate that you are a person of action. Rather than being "responsible for" something, use words like "advised," "led," "launched," "executed," "generated," "planned," "produced," etc. These  powerful resume words  (and others like them) demonstrate your ability to perform on the job and your specific role in previous jobs. Strong action words validate your capabilities and specific duties you have performed. Consider which is better: Responsible for launch of a new product. Initiated and led new product-launch that resulted in $20 million in revenue. 
 Don't forget that your resume represents who you are and what you can do when you can't be there in person to explain all of that to a recruiter or hiring manager. Your resume is just one of hundreds that fly into a company on any given day. You need to stand out from the crowd, and it is your responsibility to make that happen. By following the tips above, you'll be sure to create a resume that's better than the rest. Need more help with your resume? We're here for you!

  5 Old Resume Writing Tips To Ignore Right Now  
 Don Goodman 
 Jenna Arcand 
 December 23, 2020 
   
 In this digital age, the rules for resume writing have changed. While much about the resume may appear to be the same, there are things that you as the job seeker need to do differently today. 
  Some old resume writing tips may have been effective as recent as a few years ago, but if you want your resume to get into the right hands and help you get through the doors to your target employer, ignore these old resume writing tips below. 
 1. Keep The Resume To One Page 
 While it's still true that no hiring manager will want to go through pages and pages of your resume, trying to keep your resume down to one page is less critical than the content you have to present. If you have information that is worthy of inclusion to the resume—and that's relevant—then there's no real harm done if your resume ends up being two pages long. The fact is many employers today also run resumes through the Applicant Tracking System (ATS) before it even gets into human hands, so your first mission is to  get your resume past the ATS . In order to do that, it needs to include the right keywords that are often listed or mentioned in the job description. It needs to be optimized for the specific position that you're applying for.  
 2. Fudge Details 
 Now more than ever, your resume needs to accurately reflect your employment history. Employers aren't just looking at the resume you send in. They are doing research online—looking at your  LinkedIn profile  to compare information. They will question if what is reflected in your resume is not reflected elsewhere, so don't try present information that is far from the truth because there's a good chance you won't be able to fool anybody. Also, don't try to  fluff your resume . It's never a good idea.  
 3. Stuff Your Resume With Keywords 
 Keywords remain critical to how well your resume is received by the ATS and the human reviewer, but it's not about having a set of keyword tags at the end of your resume or hiding them by changing the font color to white so it blends with the background. You're  writing a resume  that will ultimately be reviewed and read by a human, so use the appropriate keywords in context with the rest of your content on the resume. 
 4. Include Basic Technical Skills 
 Technical skills are desired in practically every profession, but in the past where you'd highlight your knowledge of MS Office Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and so on, it's no longer relevant. The technical skills you need to talk about on your resume today have to directly relate to the function of the job. Also, it's not about just listing that you know it. You have to help the employer understand how you put the skill to use and what results you gained from it to effectively deliver the message that your technical expertise with it will benefit the employer and allow you to succeed on the job.  How can you do this? By  quantifying your accomplishments .  
 5. One Resume Does It All 
 Maybe you were able to get by sending out the same resume over and over again to every employer in the past, but if you want to compete today, you're going to need a resume customized to the employer's specific needs. Just like the objective statement may have worked in the past where you tell the employer what you're looking for, today's resumes need to inform employers what you have to offer to them. So, customize your resume for  each position that you apply for . It may take more work upfront, but your strategic efforts will pay off in the long run.  
 Change is all part of the path to greater success. Understand that what may have worked with resumes in the past will not necessarily work now. It's time to kick out the old resume writing tips that no longer work and revamp your resume with the techniques that do work today! Need more help with your resume? We're here for you!

  10 Things To Remove From Your Resume  
 Don Goodman 
 Jenna Arcand 
 December 16, 2020 
   
 The average amount of time a recruiter or hiring manager will spend scanning your resume is seven seconds. That's why it's important to have just the right kind (and amount) of information on your resume. 
 The phrase “less is more" has often been used for design purposes, but it can apply just as well to your resume. The point is to only keep information on your resume that is clear, simple, and that supports your personal brand. It is a balance of having just enough information to draw the interest of an employer, while leaving room for you to further explain during an interview. The more irrelevant information you add to your resume, the more it dilutes your key message. Employers today also look right through fluff words and are rather annoyed by them. So, how can you optimize your resume and make sure it contains the precise balance of information? Try removing these 10 things from your resume today: 
 1. Replace The Objective Statement On Your Resume With An Experience Summary 
 Employers today are not that interested in what you want. You need to tell them what you can do for them. The most effective way to achieve this is by replacing your objective statement with an experience summary.  An experience summary is a list of skills you have that are needed for the job you're applying for. They're hard skills and  transferable skills , not soft skills. By removing that objective statement, you're able to clearly start proving your value to the employer, within the first few seconds they glance at your resume.  
 2. Eliminate Superfluous Or “Fluff" Words 
 We can't tell you how many resumes start with "Dynamic visionary…" We call these  "fluff" statements  because anyone can make them and they add no real value to your resume. Keep your message on point and stick to the facts. If you want to express certain traits, demonstrate them with what you have achieved or accomplished.  Quantify your work experience . Whatever you do, just avoid meaningless, baseless statements. 
 3. Edit Out Bad Grammar & Spelling Errors 
 Spelling and grammar mistakes are a big turn off for  hiring managers . Triple check every headline and bullet point. Remove or reword any sentence that doesn't flow. Don't mix up tenses or third and first person perspective.  When in doubt, have a trusted friend or colleague review your resume. That way, you can be sure every spelling or grammar mistake is caught before you apply for a job.  
 4. List Your Primary Phone Number And Toss The Others 
 You want every section and piece of your resume to be simplified. Having multiple phone numbers right at the top of your resume makes it feel  cluttered and disorganized  even before you get to the experience section. If you must list more than one number, make sure to specify under what conditions the other numbers should be used. 
 5. Remove Discriminating Information 
 Avoid information that can lead one to discriminate against you, including age, sex, religion, marital status, and ethnicity. This includes the use of photos that should never be on a resume unless your face is an important part of your job (e.g. modeling, TV, etc.). In fact, some employers are forced to ignore your resume if it contains such information because of the chance that they may be accused of discrimination later in the process. For seasoned professionals,  age discrimination  can be a very real thing. That's why you should follow these tips on what to remove from your resume. You want to optimize your resume, not submit an outdated one.  
 6. Throw Out Your GPA 
 You do not need to reveal your graduating year, the institution(s) you transferred out of, or the high school you attended. You should also remove your GPA if you've been out of school for a while or if the number just isn't impressive. Keep information on your education specific to the  degree received , major, and institution you attended. 
 7. Get Rid Of Any Irrelevant Information 
 Employers are not interested in achievements or abilities that are not applicable to the job. If you are in sales and you helped develop an Access database to track supplies, that's nice, but not relevant. Also, be cautious about listing your associations or volunteer work that is irrelevant or may be in conflict with the potential employer. You can find this information out while  conducting research on the company .  
 8. Remove Technical Skills For Basic Software Programs 
 Most employers today expect you to be familiar with basic computer programs, such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. So, don't waste valuable space on your resume listing them. It's more than okay to remove them from the document entirely. When choosing which software programs and technologies to include on your resume, think about which ones will help you succeed at the job you're applying for. Which ones will make you  stand out from the competition ?  
 9. Do Not Include References Unless Requested 
 Employers expect you to offer  references when requested , which is typically during the latter part of the interview process. A big pet peeve of recruiters is seeing "References available upon request" on the resume. Do you really know anyone who would refuse to give references? 
 10. Cut Back On Lengthy Content 
 If you are a recent graduate, most employers do not expect your resume to be more than one page. However, if you have had considerable professional experience, your resume should be two to three pages long. The notion all resumes should be one page is not true especially in this job market. Resumes need to have enough detail to support your positioning so a two to three page resume is acceptable. But, your resume shouldn't be so long that it works against you. Your resume has to have a  compelling message  and be easy to read, so after you have tightened up your content, format it to have a decent amount of white space. Finding the right balance of information for your resume can make it impactful. It's not about how long or short your resume is, or how many employers you've worked for, but finding the right information and words to present it in the best light to demonstrate that you have the specific experiences and skills the employer is seeking. So, keep in mind the phrase, "less is more" when writing or updating your resume. 
 Writing an optimized resume is no easy task. By removing these 10 things from your resume, you'll be that much closer to landing an interview and securing your next job.

  3 Resume Tips To Avoid Appearing Overqualified  
 Don Goodman 
 Aaron Sanborn 
 December 10, 2020 
   
 Even when you have the education and professional background to qualify for the job, don't count on it as a sure win that you will be asked to come in for an interview. 
 In fact, your qualifications may hinder your chances. It's very common in today's market for employers to dismiss a job applicant's resume because they are “overqualified." 
 Sometimes there's an abundant supply of highly-qualified candidates but not enough jobs to go around for everyone. In those cases, job seekers may resort to applying for positions where the level of expertise required on the job is below their previous position's requirements. In addition, those making a career change often need to seek out entry-level positions, where there may be more job opportunities.   The challenge for job seekers is not simply competing with so many other applicants but finding a fine balance of information to place on their resume without coming off as overqualified. Employers are mostly concerned that, if you take a lesser position, you will leave once you find a position that is more commensurate with your skills. Here are a few tips to help guide you in preparing your resume for the next job opportunity and avoid coming off as overqualified and ruining your chances at the opportunity. 
 Only Include Relevant Work Experience 
 Focus on what the employer is looking for and show them you can do it. If some of your management experience is not a part of their job description, then don't mention it. This tip is especially critical for applicants moving from one career to another.  For instance, if you had your own mortgage or construction firm and are now just looking for a sales job, just speak to your experience driving sales. You can also change your title from Owner to Sales Manager. As you list your professional experience, be sure  to quantify  your sales results. 
 Only Highlight Necessary Degrees 
 Many of today's positions require candidates to have a bachelor's or master's degree. If you continued to pursue education to obtain  other degrees , earning you the title of Ph.D., M.D., or others, don't be so quick to include that information on your resume.  You have to ask if it is at all relevant to the job you are applying for. It's great if you moved on to obtain your Ph.D. in neuroscience, but if the employer's business and the job is focused on finance and accounting for toy manufacturing/distribution, your additional education will be of little relevance and may sway an employer to reconsider whether you are right for the position. 
 Explain Why You're The Right Candidate 
 Write a  disruptive cover letter  that tells a story about why you're passionate about the position, how you feel a connection to the company, and how your experience, skills, and talent make you the right fit. If there's a chance your resume comes off as overqualified, even after following the tips above, make sure to provide sufficient explanation in your cover letter. Give the employer confidence that you are challenged by the opportunity and will be there a year from now. The employer needs to know that you are not simply taking the job because you can't find anything better. They also need to be assured you aren't going to be quick to run off to another job as soon as the market improves or another opportunity opens up that is more in line with your level of experience from your previous positions.  Your resume is a marketing tool to help get your foot in the door for an interview. Placing too much information or irrelevant information will only give the employer more reason to dismiss you. Carefully review the job posting and do your research to really understand what skills and experience are desired for the position so that you present your resume and qualifications in the best light. Not everything you've accomplished, regardless of how significant it is, is appropriate to include on your resume. Need help landing the job?

  What To Do If You’ve Lied On Your Resume  
 Danni MacDonald 
 Jenna Arcand 
 November 30, 2020 
   
 When you land an interview with a company, the deciding factor was probably your resume—specifically, the types of skills and experiences you included on it. But, what if you lied on your resume? 
 Lying on your resume can come back to bite you in the hiring process. It can hinder your job search and cause more problems down the line if you  do  get hired. If you're considering lying on your resume, here's why you should think twice.  
 Why Do People Lie On Resumes? 
 Most job seekers lie on their job applications and resumes because they are worried that they can't get hired based on the facts. You  can  get hired with your current qualifications. Have faith—there is a job somewhere out there for you. However, it may not be as grand a role as you'd like if you haven't earned your stripes in the trenches yet. It's important to know your genuine strengths and to leverage them accordingly. It's your job to sell yourself to potential employers in your resume and in your job interview. You're a business-of-one, after all. Lying about qualifications to get ahead faster, though, will only put you in harm's way. Employers won't always know if you've lied on your resume or are faking your way through a  new job . But if they figure it out, you are back to square one. And you've been fired. One TV broadcaster in Toronto, Canada, for example, was fired over 10 years after he was hired purely for lying about completing his education. Marilee Jones was an ambitious academic administrator who attained the position of Dean of Admissions at MIT on the false claim of an undergraduate degree that had never been completed. She was promptly fired after the information was discovered. Some companies will go ahead with verifying your employment, find out you've lied, and never tell you. They just won't hire you—and they'll flag you as "Do Not Hire"...ever. Let's avoid that. 
 What To Do If You've Lied On Your Resume 
 So, what can you do if you've lied on your job application or your resume? Do you try to bluff your way through for 10 years or more? On the job application form, did you tell them about your misdemeanor felony conviction—if not, then when? How can you handle this without losing out on the job? 
 1. Withdraw Your Application 
 This is your safest option. Simply call and say you are "withdrawing your application at this time." If asked for a reason, tell them you've "reconsidered your application." That's the truth. They may assume the timing, title, or money isn't right or that you have another  job offer  or you heard something that makes you think it's not the right company for you. That's all okay. 
 2. Revise Your Resume & Ask The Hiring Manager To Refer The New Copy 
 In this case, you can tell them you "noticed some errors" and "want to correct them." Note that this won't work if you've created jobs or performance claims that were exaggerated. However, you can truthfully state that you want to be "more exact," if you wish. They may assume you had someone else  write your resume  and the errors were theirs.  That said, this isn't always going to work. 
 3. Come Clean 
 This may mean you lose out on the job opportunity, but sometimes people have big hearts. There's a good chance they are going to find out about the lie(s) anyway through reference checks or your own social media presence (like  LinkedIn ). Provide a corrected resume or job application and tell them the truth. In life, we need to own up to our mistakes and learn from them. Tell them that, too—that you made a mistake and you want to make it right. It's a sign of good character to do that. People make mistakes, especially under pressure (and needing a job is a lot of pressure). It's best not to end up in this position, but if the deed is done, these are the top three ways of fixing the problem. 
 How To Avoid The Problem 
 You can explain  job gaps  and sudden departures from school or a former job in the interview. If you have a criminal record, and that would include any DUIs, be upfront about it or call immediately to tell them you neglected to mention it and would like to "set the record straight." Some things are not automatic barriers to employment—but lying about them may be. 
 Now is the time to change your resume and social media profiles such as LinkedIn, so you never have to worry about this again. Do it today so if your dream job opens up tomorrow, you are polished and ready to  stand out to employers  on your own merit. Need more help with your resume? We're here for you!
