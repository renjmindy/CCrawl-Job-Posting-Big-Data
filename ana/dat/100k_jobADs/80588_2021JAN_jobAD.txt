 About MAGNOLIA PHYSICAL THERAPY 
 Magnolia Physical Therapy is the leading physical therapy and wellness facility in the New Orleans area. We pride ourselves on a hands-on approach to getting optimal results with our patients. Our Brand Promise is that our patients will acknowledge a measurable improvement on every visit. At Magnolia Physical Therapy, we build relationships with our patients that are based on trust and establishing a collaborative path to healing the patient. We don’t simply work on you; we work with you. Our physical therapists and staff bring a passionate optimism that soon starts rubbing off on the patient. We empathize with our patients’ pain and their limitations, and it is our sincere commitment to restore them to where they once were.    Do you want to return to work? Do you want to fully recover from surgery? Do you want to walk without assistance? Play sports again? Or is it something as simple as picking up and hugging your child without feeling searing pain in your back?    At Magnolia, we’ve worked with our patients to make all of these dreams and many more come true. So whether you’re an athlete, an expecting mother, or an active retiree, our team of compassionate, expert physical therapists is ready to help you achieve FREEDOM FROM PAIN.
