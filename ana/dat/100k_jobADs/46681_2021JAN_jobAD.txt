 Requisition Number:  F_200120 
 Department:  Electrical & Computer Engineering-1063 
 Description of Work: 
 The University of Nebraska-Lincoln's new initiative in Quantum Materials and Technologies (QMT) seeks collaborative faculty in physics, materials science and engineering, chemistry, and electrical and computer engineering. Research areas of interest include: quantum superposition and entanglement, quantum photonics, synthesis of complex and nanoscale materials, quantum measurement and control, quantum-enabled sensors and metrology, and synthetic quantum systems and quantum simulation. Preference will be given to experimentalists. This significant investment will increase UNL's capacity and leadership in one of the major challenges of science and engineering for the future. The QMT initiative builds upon research strengths in our NSF-supported Materials Research Science and Engineering Center and Nebraska Nanoscale Facility: National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure. 
 As part of this initiative, the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering (http://ece.unl.edu ) invites applications for a tenure-track faculty position at the Assistant Professor level in the area of quantum materials. Successful candidates are expected to develop an externally funded research program in this emerging area, and complement existing expertise in the extensive materials community at UNL. The successful candidates will contribute to the undergraduate and graduate academic programs within the department and demonstrate a commitment to excellence in both teaching and research. 
 The Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering consists of approximately 35 tenured/tenure-track faculty, 400 undergraduate students, and 120 graduate students co-located in two cities, Lincoln and Omaha, Nebraska. An outstanding infrastructure exists for conducting research, including central facilities housing state-of-the-art instrumentation within the Nebraska Center for Materials and Nanoscience (ncmn.unl.edu), the Nebraska Nanoengineering Research Facility (engineering.unl.edu/nercf/), and the Holland Computing Center (hcc.unl.edu). Opportunities for collaborations across the University of Nebraska include the University of Nebraska Medical Center; the Nebraska Center for Energy Sciences Research; the Nebraska Center for Materials and Nanoscience; the Center for Brain, Biology, and Behavior; the Nebraska Athletic Performance Laboratory; the Midwest Roadside Safety Facility; Innovation Campus; and other state- and federally-funded research centers and programs. In particular, it is expected that the new faculty member will integrate into UNL's National Science Foundation-supported Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (unl.mrsec.edu). Applicants are encouraged to visit the aforementioned websites to learn of the facilities available and on-going research in materials science at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 
 As an EO/AA employer, qualified applicants are considered for employment without regard to race, color, ethnicity, national origin, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, disability, age, genetic information, veteran status, marital status, and/or political affiliation. See http://www.unl.edu/equity/notice-nondiscrimination. 
 Minimum Required Qualifications: 
 Applicants are expected to have a Ph.D. or equivalent in electrical engineering or a closely related field. Applicants should have a record of strong scholarly achievement and a demonstrated commitment to excellence in undergraduate and graduate education. Candidates must have the potential to establish a strong externally funded research program. Candidates must demonstrate a commitment to contributing to a culture that supports diversity and inclusion.
