 Illinois workers can suffer a variety of injuries on-the-job 
 On behalf of John Lesaganich, P.C., Attorney at Law  | Feb 28, 2019 |  Workers' Compensation Injuries 
 Most residents recognize that some jobs involve a lot of physical activity or involving working around heavy machinery. Workers in these occupations may enjoy their jobs, but unfortunately these jobs can pose hazards to workers. Certain injuries are common in the workplace. 
 One  common cause of workplace injuries  is overexertion. For example, a person could be injured lifting, pushing or pulling a heavy object. A person could also be injured from having to reach too far, crawl or kneel for an extended period of time, or from having to bend too far or hold a position too long. Overexertion often causes a person to injure his or her shoulders, neck or back. 
 Workplace injuries can also occur when a worker falls. For example, a worker could slip on a slick spot on the floor, trip over torn carpeting or fall when trying to reach something high up. If an employer does not maintain a safe work environment or post warnings of possible hazards, then slips, trips and falls could occur. 
 In addition, workers could be injured if they are struck by machinery or if a part of their body gets stuck in the moving components of a machine. Situations such as these could lead to crush injuries, blindness, amputations and other serious injuries. Employers are responsible for ensuring that appropriate safeguards are provided to prevent these types of accidents from occurring. 
 Unfortunately, even with safety precautions in place, workplace injuries can occur. The state of Illinois recognizes that a serious injury could lead to substantial expenses for the injured worker, and that the worker may be unable to return to work for a period of time. For this reason,  workers' compensation for injuries  our available to residents. These benefits may cover medical expenses along with lost wages. They are a financial safety net available to qualified workers to help them out until they can get back on their feet.
