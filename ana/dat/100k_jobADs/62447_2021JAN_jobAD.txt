 Our application process 
 As HR Team, after receiving your application, we will make a preliminary selection together with the respective department. 
We will contact the candidates whose skills and qualifications fit best with the job requirement profiles and invite them to a first interview with the department supervisor. 
 It is very important for us that candidates, superiors and the HR department get to know each other as much as possible. For this reason, if the result of the first interview is favorable, we always conduct a second interview. There, a colleague from HR also participates. 
 In the interviews, we introduce our company and discuss the job with you in detail. However, you play the main role here because you describe your experiences, your knowledge, your interests and your passion for the task. 
 We look forward to receiving your job application!
