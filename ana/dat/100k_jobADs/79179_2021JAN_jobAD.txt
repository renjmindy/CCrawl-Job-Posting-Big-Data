  Poll: Is This 'Two And A Half Men' Star Killing His Career?

 After working at a company for 10 years, would you openly bash them and tell people not to take their business there? That's just what 'Two and a Half Men' star Angus T. Jones is doing. But is this stunt  killing his career ? The 19-year-old, who has played the role of Jake Harper since he was eight, urges viewers to stop watching the show - despite earning a hefty $350,000 per episode. According to  Fox News , the actor said that he no longer wants to be a part of the show anymore, saying that it's "filth." "People say it’s just entertainment," he said in a  new video for the Forerunner Christian Church . "Do some research on the effects of television and your brain, and I promise you you’ll have a decision to make when it comes to television, especially with what you watch." After causing quite the ruckus about the popular show, Jones has been called the "anti-Sheen" for standing up for his religious beliefs and putting his career at risk. But the question is, how will this move affect Jones's future? Will this stunt help him stand out as an actor or will it end up killing his career? What do you think? Please take our poll, and tell us what you think in the comment section below! [poll id="99"]
