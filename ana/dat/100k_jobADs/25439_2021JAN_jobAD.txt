 No difference. Some university call it one thing some call it another. 
 Dental Licenses were trditionally given by the College of Surgeons. Therefore it was called Dental SURGERY. And really it is, we cut and mend living human tissue.before that we als did haircuts and were called barber surgeons. The traditional barbers pole with the red spiral running down it represents a toothb with blood running down it.
