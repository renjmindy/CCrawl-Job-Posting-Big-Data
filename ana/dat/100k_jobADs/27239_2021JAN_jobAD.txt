 Basic Computer Training 
 Regardless of their experience and position, all employees should have some level of proficiency in personal computing skills to excel in their current job and maintain their competitiveness for career advancement. 
 From application software to operating systems to the Internet, this online course library spans a wide range of skill sets and caters to a variety of interests. Hard-to-digest technical manuals are nowhere to be found and most application courses-such as Microsoft Excel or Word-introduce beginning, intermediate, and advanced training topics separately to help learners transition smoothly to the next level at their own pace. 
 CFor your convenience, courses can also be delivered through a Network site license. Click on a link below to learn more about a specific course, its content, delivery method, and software requirements.
