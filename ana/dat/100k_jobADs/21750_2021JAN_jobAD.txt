 Who we are   :

 We run a strong domain ownership model. As a Principal Engineer you will be a trusted technical authority and someone who communicates to the domains a consistent strategic direction adhering to architecture blueprints and ensuring the highest quality implementation. 
 We are looking for someone with previous job experience as an engineering lead/principal engineer ideally within a financial services company.
