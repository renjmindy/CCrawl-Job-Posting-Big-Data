 We're looking for a coder to join our team and help us make multiplayer experiences for our games. If you know what it takes to sync up multiple players in physics-based gameplay, and haven't fainted yet, we really want to talk to you! 
 It's not all lag and leaderboards though, there's plenty of room to help out in offline game development, from prototyping to implementing gameplay mechanics. 
 We are excited about candidates who value efficiency, have a pragmatic approach to problem solving and an eagerness to learn new things. We're looking for someone who actively wants to be part of our team, has good communication skills and common courtesy. 
 Candidates from under-represented backgrounds are encouraged to apply. We can provide an IBO training programme.
