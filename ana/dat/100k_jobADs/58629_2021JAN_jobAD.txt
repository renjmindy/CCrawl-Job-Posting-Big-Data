  If You Can’t Pass THIS Test, You Won’t Get Job Interviews  
 Ariella Coombs 
 June 09, 2016 
 If you’re not getting interviews, a few things might be coming into play. Take this test to see what might be holding you back from getting job interviews. If you answered “YES” to any of these things, you need to reevaluate your job search strategy. 
 
 If you’re spending your time applying online… 
 You’re wasting your time. Online job boards are typically flooded with candidates, so standing out is close to impossible. Plus, even if you’re the most qualified candidate, if your resume has a single error in terms of formatting or content, it’s likely going to get automatically tossed out by automated filtering systems (or ATS) before a real person can actually see it. So, chances of someone calling you in for an interview are extremely slim. 
 If you have an objective statement on your resume… 
 You’re saying you’re behind the times. As shallow as it may seem, an outdated strategy increases your risk of falling victim to age discrimination before you even get a chance to prove yourself. Moreover, you’re wasting valuable real estate on the top of your resume. Instead of an objective statement, showcase your top qualifications there. 
 If you’re including subjective terms like “results-driven” on your resume… 
 You’re not saying much. Subjective terminology like “results-driven,” “team player,” “high-achiever,” and so on have been overused to the point that they don’t mean anything to recruiters. Zilch. Stick with the hard facts and skip the fluff.  I have a video on how you can do this effectively... 
 If you use the same resume for every job to which you apply… 
 You’re selling yourself short. Every job is going to be a little different in terms of qualifications, hard skills, and other keywords. If you don’t tailor your resume to showcase your most relevant stuff, you risk losing out to the ‘other guy’ (or gal) and getting the boot from the ATS.  (Read this article to for my #1 tip when it comes to customizing your resume!) 
 If you use the same cover letter for every job to which you apply… 
 You look just like everyone else. Your cover letter is the voice to your resume. It says what your resume can’t. If you don’t leverage that opportunity and share your story in your own words, you might as well skip writing a cover letter altogether (please don’t do this). Not sure what you need to say or how you should say it?  Here are my top tips for writing a cover letter… 
 If your resume have excessive formatting or dense paragraphs… 
 You’re making it hard for recruiters to like you.  Recruiters only spend about six seconds reading your resume , so you want to make it easy for them to find what they need. Too much formatting is distracting. You might think you’re highlighting everything, but you’re actually just making it harder to read (not only for the recruiter, but also for the ATS). So, dump excessive bolding, italics, and underlining. Also, break up any dense paragraphs with bullet points. Leverage that white space and draw the reader’s eye to the stuff you want to stand out the most. 
 Didn’t pass the test? It’s time to reevaluate your strategy. 
 Real talk. If you’re not getting job interviews, it’s time to reevaluate your strategy - because, obviously, this one isn’t working. Stop relying on online job boards. Use better keywords in your resume. Ditch that objective statement. Make sure you’re using the latest resume formatting techniques. Customize your materials every time. And, most importantly, know when to seek help!
