  Is Personal Branding Necessary for All Careers?  
 Work It Daily 
 February 15, 2010 
 Dear Experts, I keep reading these articles about selling yourself and your image. I can see where all of this is very true, for sales people, managers and executives, but I wonder if it applies equally to other fields. For example, I am in the semiconductor industry, my talents are largely in the technical area. Social events and selling are difficult for a lot of technical people. I can imagine being able to sell myself being helpful, but I have no skills for doing that and am not good at small talk. I don't think I am going to interest people with a lot of technical talk. Do you have any insight for these kinds of jobs?  Here is how our CAREEREALISM-Approved Experts answered this question on Twitter:   Q#438  Personal brand=consistent image/message in resume, cover letter, social media =highlight your core value to employer. (@ juliaerickson )  Q#438  Branding isn't all selling yourself, it's being intentional about the impressions you make- and that transcends. (@ EmilyBennington )  Q#438  It's just your way of expressing yourself. Make sure the real YOU stands out, that's what matters. (@ beneubanks )  Q#438  You're selling/promising results! What does your employer need to achieve via you performing your job right? (@ resumeservice )  Q#438  Every1 has brand. What matters is what u do w/ it. 1st look at skills, 2nd look at their needs. Overlap is your brand. (@ JoshuaWaldman )  Q#438  Small talk is more than talking technical at work. Try attending network events to work on your networking skills. (@ gradversity )  Q#438  A solid work ethic, the ability to engage and help others be at ease transcends career paths. Develop social skills.
