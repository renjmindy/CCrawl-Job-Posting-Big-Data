 Love & Hip-Hop: Erica Mena Blasts VH1 & Said Her Fight With Kimbella Affected Her "Modeling" Career 
 
 This past Monday,  the reality world was introduced to model Erica Mena , on the sixth episode  Love & Hip-Hop . Every since the episode aired, Mena have been getting a lot of negative feedback in the press. This 24-year-old Bronx native is now criticizing  VH1  over the way she was portrayed in the show. Mena got into an ugly fight with Kimbella Vanderhee. The two ladies fought after Vanderhee tossed a champagne glass at Mena, over some bad comments Mena had made regarding Vanderhee’s modeling career. Now, Mena is claiming the fight that aired on this week’s episode of  Love & Hip Hop  has ruined her modeling career and it's  VH1  's fault. 
 Mena told  TMZ  , she was completely misrepresented in the episode -- blaming show editors for unfairly portraying her as the bad guy … and Kimbella as an angel. "  My whole image in my career is now affected by this. I wanted them to pull this clip because I don’t want to show this side of me  ," said Mena.

 I am sorry to say but I seen the episode. Erica you came into the meeting with Kimbella with an attitude. You also showed just plain disrespect towards her. Not saying I really like Kimbella either but in this case you were just flat wrong and you were acting like you a a big glass of haterade….
