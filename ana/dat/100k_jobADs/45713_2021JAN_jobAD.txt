 Career Description 
 Insulation workers use different techniques and tools to insulate a house or structure. Sometimes they work on new facilities or houses that are being built and sometimes they work to renovate or refurbish hold houses. Workers distribute insulating materials evenly into small spaces within floors, ceilings, or walls, using blowers and hose attachments. They often work indoors but have some work outdoors as well. Safety is key and the job is physically demanding but rewarding. Workers should be able to work on their own but also as part of a team.
