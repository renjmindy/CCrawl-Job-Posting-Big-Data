 Movies offer the best form of escapism and have for long been the most popular entertainment option for individuals and families across the world. Movies gradually evolved over time from crude puppet shows and magic lantern shows initially in the early 1800s to the silent era, the talkies era, technicolor, cinemascope, and digital era. Today, digital cinema is witnessing transformational change as filmmakers get to experiment with visual storytelling while audiences get to experience more immersive and incredible entertainment. Digital involves a range of creative CG disciplines including animation and VFX. Most of the talent that works in films are either employees in a production house/CG studio or are freelancers. More and more animators, especially freelancers are playing a key role in filmmaking. For instance, a  freelance anime artist  is in high demand today as more anime series, films, and comics are being produced than ever before. 
 Other freelance talent in the animation space such as characters artists are also finding more work. As more television channels broadcast cartoon series to cater to the growing population of kids in the age group of 4 - 14 years, demand for cartoon films is soaring and so is the demand for the  freelance cartoon animator  who offers his expertise to add speed, cost-efficiency, and quality to a studio’s project. 
 Freelancers are being roped in to support a studio’s core team in executing and expediting animation film projects. Other specialists in the domain who are hired by animation studios include  storyboard artists  , concept artists, visual development artists, digital painters, colour key artists, and  freelance after effects animators .
