 Oil & Gas Manufacturer Boosts Efficiency with WFM, Labor Tracking & Job Costing Implementation 
 Improving visibility, accuracy and alignment of staff to business demands 
 Manufacturing & Logistics 
 
 CHALLENGE 
 
 This large, global oil and gas manufacturer sought more powerful visibility and insight into their workforce efficiency to help manage labor costs and eliminate waste. With frequent acquisitions leaving multiple disparate time & labor systems in place across 1,200+ global locations, 40+ ERP systems in use, and a company-wide practice of hand-entering the previous day’s labor data into work logs, this proved difficult. By the time the data collected was available to help drive solid business decisions, the real window of opportunity had passed. 
 
 SOLUTION 
 
 Workforce Insight helped steer this global manufacturing organization away from the use of spreadsheets and manual data collection, implementing solutions to streamline timekeeping and immediately capture, synthesize and centralize payroll information to provide precise, real-time labor tracking and work order data to the company’s multiple ERP systems. This improved the accuracy of labor and job costing, giving the company the visibility needed to adjust resources based on immediate demand and eliminating inefficiencies caused by staffing according to outdated information. Workforce Insight services included:
