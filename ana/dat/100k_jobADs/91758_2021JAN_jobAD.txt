 New Year, New job 
 2019 marks the start of a new chapter in my career. After four really fun and informative years with Ciena, I have joined Colt Technology Services to head up a new team focusing on the mobile & wireless market segment. It's been a full on start since joining at the beginning of the year. 
 Here are a couple of press releases regarding my appointment. 
 Capacity Media  - Colt names former Ciena man Gilmour as head of mobile connectivity solutions 
 "Speaking of his appointment, Gilmour said: “Colt’s network assets put it in the best possible position to be able to assist MNOs to define and cement their mobile backhaul strategies. While there’s a lot of talk in the market about 5G, there are many ways in which businesses can be making the most of their 4G networks. 
 “Colt can be a key partner in this space, and I’m excited to be joining the business at a pivotal time where many are looking to get the most out of their cellular networks to be ready for whatever the future may hold.” 
 His new role will see Gilmour based at Colt’s London headquarters, working alongside Colt’s international teams to boost the company’s offering in the mobile market. He will report into Gilder, who also joined Colt from Ciena in September of last year. 
 Gilder said: “The reach and density of the Colt IQ Network across key metros all around the globe makes Colt a strong partner for Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) as they start readying themselves for a 5G world. Mark has extensive experience in this space, and I am thrilled that his wealth of knowledge about the mobile industry will shape Colt’s mobile strategy.”

 Colt Annual Charity Bike Rides 
 In 2020, the Colt Charity Bike Ride celebrated it's 9th year. Due to the global pandemic though, we weren't able to run the event in the same manner. Recognising that our charity partners needed help more than ever, the event was transformed into a virtual challenge event with over 600 people running, cycling, walking and yoga'ing their way around the entire global Colt network. The challenge raised 150,000 Euro to add to over 1.3m Euro's raised in previous years for children's charities across Colt countries. The event will hopefully be back in 2021.. watch this space
