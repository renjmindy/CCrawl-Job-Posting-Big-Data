 What's Life Got To Do With It? 
 ](https://savasvikos.wordpress.com/2016/02/29/whats-life-got-to-do-with-it/) 
 Recently I came across Arthur, an older gentleman who used to live in our building. I had not seen him or his wife for six months and in the past we had talked a few times. They seemed to be nice and private people. 
 Although we did not speak the same language when I saw him he was in tears, trying to explain in English that his wife passed away a few months ago. 
 He was devastated. And, I could not help but feel a degree of his pain, as I thought of my wife upstairs. 
 There are times when we lose someone dear to us. It is something most of us try to avoid thinking about, and we tell ourselves we’ll deal with it when it happens to us. But we all secretly hope it never does. 
 Our impermanence is something, however, we should be thinking about. When we do that, it actually helps live a better life. 
 The thought of our eternal departure reminds us to appreciate our family, loved ones and friends while we are still all present in each other’s lives. Even in those mundane moments, or the tough times, the prospect of someone no longer being a part of our daily lives is a reminder to hold every moment with them close to the heart and memory. 
 When the specter of what is always just beyond the horizon of our days becomes something we embrace, we learn to live a different life. 
 If you were told you had less than one year to live, what would you do with each of your remaining days? 
 Would you live a life that never pushed the boundaries beyond your comfort zone? Or, would you reach out to the world in a way you have never done, full of fearlessness? 
 Would you squeeze the very last drop out of your life and make it as fulfilling as possible? 
 Or, would you remain fixated on the excuses many of us accumulate that keep us from living a life on our terms? 
 Would you do something out of the ordinary scope of your life? 
 What happens if you learned that your spouse, partner or loved one had less than a year to live? What would you help that person do with each of those remaining days? 
 Perhaps your first instinct is to say, “I'm only human. I only can do so much." 
 I’d like to challenge you to think with regard to your own life, how you can rise up to the fact that our life as it is today will not be like that forever. Unfortunately, most of us will experience the passing of our other half or someone who is a kindred spirit. 
 The way to meet the permanent sleep that awaits each of us is to accept the idea of mortality every day. 
 It is by doing this, mindfully, each and every day that we can then do the following: 
 
 
 Live life to the fullest. 
 
 
 Be good to people and appreciate their presence in our lives always. 
 
 
 Take care and enjoy our families, even in those moments that are seemingly banal and not full of any excitement other than simply occupying the same space in a room. 
 
 
 Do the things  you  have always wanted to do: a trip, start a new business or write a book, etc. 
 
 
 Treat yourself and your partner often to little and simple things, which demonstrate you care. 
 
 
 Do something outrageous and fun, just because. 
 
 
 Invite people (even strangers) to your home and into your life. 
 
 
 Really see and experience the growth and development of your children instead of always being at work or too tired. 
 
 
 Many times we do something because we feel we ought to do this or the other to keep somebody happy, buy what about you? 
 Life is too short to hate, to be unfulfilled or not to be grateful for each day. Say “thank you” more often. Be ambitious to do your thing, but humble at the same time. Don't be afraid to say I'm sorry if you made a mistake. 
 Forgive yourself in life. It’s okay if you didn't become an astronaut, quarterback or a successful entrepreneur or even actor. Life is still good because you have it and those who you love with you. It's fine that you followed another path and became something else. Glamour is overrated. 
 Realize that your mission is to live your life, experience the journey and if you are part of a couple, to make the other person’s life better along with your own. 
 If you live to be 80 years old you are living for only  29,200 days . Think of those 365 days a year mindfully and with purpose. With your time on earth you are meant to say, “I lived. I experienced. I loved.” 
 Get to a point in your life where if something happened to you – or someone you loved – you can say have no regrets. I lived my life. I cherished my family and those around me. And, I wrote  the  definitive story of an amazing life. 
 What a powerful feeling if all of us can experience that. 
 What a life!

 The Right Attitude And How To Create Momentum 
 ](https://savasvikos.wordpress.com/2016/01/28/attitude/) 
 The right attitude is paramount in the worlds of business, entrepreneurship or career advancement. Someone will argue that as long as you are a professional who knows your area of expertise well, you will do fine in life. 
 Not necessarily. 
 There have been many people with advanced degrees and experience who have not made their mark after many years of struggle. 
 Attitude 
 Here’s why: Attitude. 
 The right attitude is crucial. It will propel you to different heights no matter what comes your way. If you are determined with a mission and a vision of what you're looking for, then you're halfway there. 
 Of course charisma and a positive outlook on life as well as enthusiasm about what's coming next, doesn’t hurt. Attitude can be invaluable or it can be destructive if used the wrong way. You can have a negative outlook and attitude on life that simply does you in. 
 Having said that, if you're looking for a particular outcome having the attitude that nothing will stand in your way and deter you from doing what you want in your life, is the place to start. 
 Persistence 
 But attitude is not enough. You have to persistently have the right attitude. You can never blink, especially when things don’t go your way. You need to exude confidence that flows from your attitude towards life and you need to condition yourself to overcome the obstacles that will come your way while pursuing it. 
 In other words, expect the unexpected. 
 Persistence can only be achieved with a good and positive attitude. 
 So the way someone's attitude is, will translate into the ongoing behavior that will be adopted with regard to how that person acts, reacts and talks to others. How that person motivates himself or herself to keep on going. How that person uses innovation and creativity to get through the hurdles. 
 Gratitude 
 Attitude and persistence are important. But then, another ingredient also becomes essential. 
 That element is gratitude. 
 One has to maintain an attitude of gratitude for everything you have so far and for everything that will come your way, realizing that better and bigger things are around the corner. Being thankful in advance of what you will be receiving is essential because it keeps you centered, humble and real. 
 Many people, unfortunately, don’t foster these qualities. Perhaps it’s because they do not believe in themselves or have become jaded and embittered. 
 No one said life is easy but we do not need to make it any more difficult than it is by having the wrong attitude, or a sense of entitlement, which has no connection with anyone other than ourselves. 
 Getting to the Finish Line 
 Do you want to get to your “finish line”, whatever that is and whatever it might take? Then "try and try again." Get your head straight. Get your attitude right. Know that you have to be persistent and develop gratitude for what you have – however much or little. Stay away from the negative, including entitlement. No one is entitled to anything. 
 Get your facts straight, use your knowledge and motivation and act accordingly. 
 Research the life of inventors and you will realize that before they succeeded in creating "Y", they failed hundreds or even thousands of times, but they kept on going. With every failure they learned and made their vision clearer and better. 
 I understand that getting involved into something new, embarking into a new business or anything new can be unnerving, but stay focused on the reason why you need to do this. Maintain your vision always in the picture frame, and you will realize that you cannot be deterred. 
 Calculated risk, at times, is absolutely necessary to get places. It is either this - tackling life - or doing nothing (i.e. the alternative) and wondering the rest that of your life “what if”. 
 Doors will open if you persist, people will notice you, opportunities will be created and all you need to remember is to repeat, repeat…repeat. Nothing happens without clarity of vision and persistence. 
 Then, the more success the more fearless you become, the more you keep on repeating and building on what you’ve achieved. Life is a testing ground that can be very challenging, but also exceedingly beautiful. You just live it a day at a time, one step at a time with the attitude that you are taking the right steps.

 Finding Your Groove 
 ](https://savasvikos.wordpress.com/2015/04/10/finding-your-groove/) 
 
 For those who are middle-aged and finding it difficult to either become entrepreneurs or wishing to rejoin the workforce, there are a few things to keep in mind. The most important thing to remember is that middle-aged workers have a lot to offer, including a wealth of life and work experience, esprit de corps and loyalty. 
 Of course, anyone can try entrepreneurship, and in today’s world, freelancers are increasingly becoming the bulk of the workforce. In the not too distant future, there will be more freelancers than individuals employed in a traditional full-time job. 
 Whether you are looking to become an entrepreneur or an employee, there are still some things you will have to do. You need to have clarity around the idea you want to execute in a new business or they type of company or business where you would like to seek employment. Skipping this basic step and doing or taking “anything” is simply a recipe for failure. Lay out a clear vision for what you want to do, why and how to get there. 
 I’m a big believer in being prepared. If you’re prepared, you can “wing it”. If you don’t know what you’re talking about and you make everything up as you go along, it’ll eventually catch up to you. So, research and learn about what it takes to be successful. Understand how the field may be changing and what it takes, including marketing yourself or the business, to be successful. 
 Being an entrepreneur or employee still requires realistic expectations. Yes, high expectations are important, as are dreams and vision, but no matter what you do, it always takes a great deal more work than you ever expect. And, so setting expectations that are based on sound reasons and assumptions is going to get you much further. 
 Things have changed drastically due to globalization, outsourcing, disruption, innovation, position redundancy and automation. Yes, everything was different ten or twenty years ago, but if you are looking for employment, recognize that even the selection of candidates is different today. 
 Now a resume will be initially checked by software programs that search for unique key words in order to identify candidates for further consideration. This happens before a pair of human eyes even looks at your resume. Those resumes that make it past that first hurdle then go to a human resources specialist who will devote about 6 seconds to reviewing it. Imagine the odds of getting chosen in many positions, based on those two realities. 
 Today, a lot of success comes in not only what you know but also whom you know. It is vitally important for both employees and entrepreneurs to network. If you happen to be an introvert, this can be a challenge. A good technique is setting a goal to invite one or two people a week for coffee. If you have the personality and are more adventurous, attending networking meetings is a better way to go since you can meet many more people and use your time more effectively. 
 Your overall goal is to make as many meaningful human connections as possible. In a startup business, these individuals can become your customers or lead you to new clients if you have the solution to a need. Otherwise, in the job market, by networking, you are helping to position yourself outside of the resume stream that will first get vetted by a computer and then a specialist. It allows you the opportunity to potentially get your resume in the hands of the decision-making hiring manager. 
 Focus groups, networking meetings, coffees, employment and business conventions– anywhere you can show your true colors in person are all effective strategies. Don’t rely on only one strategy. Use a variety of them and see what works best for you. 
 If you are middle-aged, you may have experience and a bias that you may not realize. It happens generation after generation. You have older employees or entrepreneurs who have to work for, or with, much younger people. It doesn’t matter. Even if they don’t have the experience you do, you probably do have something to learn from them. Be open and willing to work with a younger person, including a boss. 
 Don’t allow the assumption be true that the older you become, the less inclined you are to be up to speed on the latest technology. Consistently brush up on technology, computer skills, social media and news so you can compete and operate in today’s world. 
 Try to lead a healthy lifestyle. It might not seem important, but it is crucial to success. You need to be at the top of your game, and this means mentally, emotionally, physically and spiritually. You want to have vitality and energy–no matter your age. 
 Unfortunately, life can be hard and especially in an environment with constant change. Employers want success. Customers want the same things. The reality is no one cares in business about your issues, complaints or baggage. All they care about is high performance. Remembering this will only help you. 
 Be willing to go the extra effort, as this will differentiate you from your competitors. Although middle-age is an advantage, it can sometimes be viewed as a disadvantage, so just accept this as a fact of life, don’t work against it. Instead, go with the change and use it to your advantage. 
 Finally, realize this, any one–no matter the age–in order to survive and thrive needs to be smart and work hard. Utilize all of your skills and leverage and extend your network to its fullest. Always be willing to learn. In today’s world, everything changes constantly. As someone once said, “Life is a contact sport”.

 Never Give Up Your Field of Dreams 
 ](https://savasvikos.wordpress.com/2014/05/19/never-give-up-your-field-of-dreams/) 
 
 We all remember the movie with Kevin Costner, but I will not be talking about baseball. What I want to write about, however, are our dreams and what happens when things don't come your way. 
 When we are young, we all have dreams. Some of us are blessed to live a child’s life that involves fantasy and dreams. I am sure as a child you were probably asked by an adult in your life, “What do you want to be when you grow up?” 
 Then you grow up, and sometimes life happens to you. Other times, you have some control and you make life happen. But, as the years pass and especially if you are tossed around a little, or a lot, in rough seas, your dreams either evolve, and become more realistic, or they start to disappear. Maybe, one day you find yourself quietly sitting somewhere thinking to yourself – how did I get here and where did all of those plans and dreams go? 
 I am usually very focused in my life, those in my life and where I can make a difference. However, I think most of us will agree that something very different has happened, especially since the economic melt-down. We see report after report, hear commentators or listen to people complain, sometimes bitterly, about the loss of what they once had. 
 All around us we have the ashes of lives and parts of our collective society in ruins. We all have someone outside of ourselves to blame for this, such as the recession, the job market, advanced technology, globalization, etc. Whatever it is, I think all of us know that nothing – absolutely nothing – can be taken for granted. Not your job. Not the house or apartment you live in. Not your health. Not your wife. Not your children. Nothing. I have read that what we knew of our lives before this enormous societal shift that kicked off the first decade plus of the 21st Century was all part of a big lie or illusion that we bought into. Perhaps. 
 Nevertheless, we are all left standing, or maybe on our knees at the moment, knowing that nothing will ever be the same. Period. 
 So, what do you do? Do you stay on your knees? Do you hang it all up and stay under the covers? What do you do? 
 Maybe it’s because of who I am, maybe it’s because of how I was raised or my ethnic heritage but all I know is you get yourself up each and every day. You never quit. You never let anyone get the best of you. 
 There is a great piece of history from Greece, and it comes to us in the life and efforts of Leonidas and his warriors. Essentially, Leonidas was the King of Sparta who defended Greece against an invasion by the Persians. In August of 480 BC, he took 300 Spartans and with other Greeks who joined him, he led a force of approximately 7,000, which was substantially smaller in comparison to the 200,000 men modern scholars say were on the Persian side. 
 You can read the story of the  Battle of Thermopylae , but the most important thing to know is that Leonidas faced his battle head-on. With a smaller force of men than what he started out with in battle, he courageously fought to the death to try to prevent the Persians entry into Greece through the only access road. His tale is a story of absolute courage despite overwhelming and devastating odds. 
 That’s what we all need to do. We all need to fight our battle head-on and with force. And, in my experience, the only way to fight that battle, whatever it is – is to have a plan. A dream. You have to be shooting for something. Leonidas’ goal was to prevent passage to the Persians. He had a plan. He stuck to the plan. 
 We each need to do the same. We can’t allow life to beat us into submission. You can’t let cancer, disease, a job loss, a marriage that ends, the death of a loved one – anything – defeat you. Leonidas still lives today in memory because of that courage to stand and fight, no matter the odds. 
 So, the message here, is to dream. Even if you don’t dare, just dream one thing. Make one plan to kick the disease, get a new job, start your own business, get a new home, marry that woman, travel the world, whatever it is…And then, whatever life throws at you, do not quit. Do not give up until the game is really and truly over, if you do not succeed. And, know this, even if the moment comes you do not get it all; the game is indeed over and there are no seconds left, you fought. You did not give up. And,  that  makes all the difference in the world.

 The Trouble with Quality of Life 
 ](https://savasvikos.wordpress.com/2014/04/21/the-trouble-with-quality-of-life/) 
 
 How do we compare with the rest of the world and the issue? Some do not see anything wrong with working constantly enjoying your week or two weeks off unless you have invested 10 to 20 years into your place of employment. There is nothing wrong with working hard, it is an admirable quality, something bestowed to us since the early days of the Protestant work ethic. In addition many of us of ethnic background are proud to work hard to provide for our families and reach a point as the years pass that we are able to reap the rewards. 
 Things have changed unfortunately and not always for the better. Although, I try to be positive on life, we all need to be able to adjust to the conditions presented (economy, benefit cuts in healthcare, pensions, retirement, class inequality, etc.) 
 The name of the game is not to be rigid. For some of us being around for some years, change is not easy. I understand completely but if we do not change and adjust to our environment what then? 
 Case in point: Vacation time in the US is some of the lowest of the developed countries. Unfortunately at times, people do not understand vacations, or even that time off from work is not a luxury by any stretch, but actually important for health and well-being. Employers believe that they should get the most out of their employees. Somehow it works for them. 
 When Americans start traveling abroad, not just reading about it but immersing themselves into the different other cultures, seeing how other people live, how they manage even with a lot less to have better quality of life, some start realizing that they would rather do many things different. We are not made to just work. 
 I do not know where this whole concept evolved into this "work and no play". Yes, the upwardly mobile enjoy better lifestyles but what about the rest of the people? Why do their lives revolve around work as the center of the universe? People not only live to work and not only one job, but two or more, with declining incomes, lower salaries and increasing commission related positions. Even physicians these days are judged on production and their incomes are proportional to how many patients they see per hour versus having the time to do a good diagnosis by having the time to ask the pertinent questions they need. Sometimes corners are cut working within the time limitations and quotas imposed. Many people are overworked underpaid and stressed out to the max. 
 People consume exorbitant amounts of medications - doctor prescribed, over the counter or even holistic just to get through the day. My point being that we were not made to just work. Although many might argue that the human body is resilient and can get through some of the most punishing regiments, the question we should be asking is "But, is that healthy?" Is this the way to lead your life? 
 Isn't there something more to life? Employers should realize that happy employees stand for productive employees, which translates into less absenteeism, more loyalty, healthier work environment that leads to more profitability. I have asked a number of Europeans while traveling abroad as well as in the States, for example, how they feel about their vacation time. How much time they take, and it never fails to already know their answers. 
 Europeans love their extra time compared to their US counterparts. Their vacation is so important that if they do not take the amount of time allotted they might lose some of their benefits since they would be considered at a higher-risk for developing health issues (heart problems, elevated blood pressure etc). From the employer side they have happier employees working for them, lower costs for employee retention. 
 Although, I cannot solve these issues the only thing I am aspiring to bring you is some awareness. I want you to ask yourself, is work all we are worth? What can we do about it? Where do we start? I also want to challenge employers to learn to be aware of what people need. Everyone deserves time to devote to their loved ones and to themselves so we can live fuller lives.

 Take The Plunge, The Water is Not That Cold 
 ](https://savasvikos.wordpress.com/2014/04/09/take-the-plunge-the-water-is-not-that-cold/) 
 
 This is for those who want to find their inner child and for those brave souls who, despite what life is throwing their way, still dream big. You may be working somewhere but you're looking for a change. You might be looking to start your own business or even travel and experience the world. Perhaps you want to live overseas or you want move out of the town where you live. 
 Life has a way of happening to you or because of you. It doesn't wait. When you want things to happen, sometimes they don't. And when you least expect things, life happens. Somehow, it always seems that "now" is not the best time for changing things. Tomorrow will be better, but somehow tomorrow never comes. When I am looking to make a change, I tend to write down the pluses versus the minuses and that helps me determine my next steps. If you happen to be the analytical type, I would recommend you go through this process because seeing it in writing helps you visually see the pros and cons. 
 But, be careful of paralysis of analysis. Over-analyzing change often leads to no change at all. So, a more thoughtful and less stressful way to handle things before you embark on your dreams and trying to turn them into reality, would to test the waters a little. Think it over, research, but put a plan together and a timeline. Determine calculated risk. Again, I do not suggest that you disappear to the Pacific all of a sudden or invest every penny of your savings on the idea of starting a business. These are not calculated risks. But in the beginning, take smaller steps to realize the dream, determining the best thing for you and if it is something you can handle without jeopardizing personal relationships with loved ones will go a long way to ultimately making it happen. And, as results unfold, measure progress - accept failures, make adjustments and then continue to execute on your larger plans. 
 Of course you know your priorities but realize this, if you don't follow your soul and your calling, who will? If not now, when? I can also tell you this - the experiences you would live and the regiment you would follow, will make you grow and that is a necessary ingredient in life. And, the feeling of personal freedom - to trying to lead some part of your life on your terms - is priceless. All of this does not come easy. I wish, I could tell you otherwise. You probably will work harder than you ever did, but you would be working for you toward your goals and dreams. It is a great feeling for those who can act on their dreams and turn them into reality. 
 Fear is natural, but you have to take a step and let it be OK because the alternative would probably be to never try. 
 There are so many things to explore - starting a side business, losing yourself on a trip to Italy, enrolling in a cooking class in France and starting to learn French. Or perhaps going to Barcelona and checking out the Spanish culture, staying on a Greek island and writing a book, or while at a convention in South America adding a couple of weeks to strictly explore Buenos Aires and learn how to tango. Try it, don't let it get erased from your memory because it will only become more difficult to act on it later - someday. Again, often, "someday" never comes. 
 No one knows what life will bring us tomorrow. As Louise Erdrich wrote, "And when it happens that you are broken, or betrayed, or left, or hurt, or death brushes near, let yourself sit by an apple tree and listen to the apples falling all around you in heaps, wasting their sweetness. Tell yourself you tasted as many as you could.”

 “If you’re going through hell, keep walking" 
 ](https://savasvikos.wordpress.com/2014/04/03/if-youre-going-through-hell-keep-walking/) 
 
 Let’s talk about persistence, determination and overcoming objections and how they relate to every day living. 
 In case you don’t know my background, I have been in sales in a variety of ways for many years. I have sold everything from hotel properties and yachts to concepts and ideas. I started in my career selling shoes in Europe. Although I might bring business into the conversation a couple of times, the goal is really to inspire you when dealing with different situations in life. So take persistence, for example. In life we are all conditioned since an early age to say “no”. Parents teach us to say “no” to strangers. When we walk into a store and the sales person asks, “How can I help you?”, the first thing we mutter is, “Just browsing”. “Are you looking for something?”, the sales clerk asks. We reply, “No”. 
 In our sales transactions – and oftentimes in our day-to-day dealings - we tend to say “no”, at first. But, in reasonable everyday situations, can it be an invitation to go deeper and start pealing the onion layers? In my experience, that first no is where the work begins. That’s where you need to dig deeper and find those dominant buying motives. Professional sales people know, that this is a core principal as to the reason why someone is converted from a prospect to a buyer. 
 However, in life everything is selling. In case you had some doubts - from an early age when a baby cries to get the attention of a parent, to the time when someone is going on a job interview and they are talking to the hiring manager, to the time a manager is motivating the work team, to a new a campaign to hit company goals, to asking someone out on a date or convincing someone to go someplace when they prefer to stay home. Everything is selling. 
 Do we accept “no” for any answer every time we hear it? 
 In relationships, we disagree often with each other’s point of view, and sometimes we may reach an impasse. Ideally, when that happens both parties try to agree to something by having to compromise a little. So, let’s expand on this. Anything you want in life badly, you have to typically fight for it. Rarely does it just come to you. You will hear many “no’s” along the way. The question here is, do you just quit or stay the course with persistence and determination to tackle the task at hand? 
 Although rules have changed and life can be difficult, especially when you are aspiring to greater goals, life is still beautiful. It is worth all of the fighting to reach your goals – whether in your career or your personal life. 
 But how do you stay determined and persistent when you constantly hear “no”. Essentially, you need to stoke the fire inside of you that tells you to keep going and don’t listen to that voice that may be in your mind telling you to quit. You need to visualize that job that you want, or that trip that you want to take but you continually find excuses to avoid taking that first step. And, if you keep getting doors slammed in your face, then keep figuring ways to get to that goal – even if it means going through the window instead of the door. You need to be very clear with regard to what you are looking for out of life. What is the goal? And, if it matters, then you need to keep fighting like that boxer who is pummeled in the 8th round but will not lie down. Sometimes, you will lose that battle. Sometimes, you will fail. But, it’s part of the journey to the overall goal. Defeat, failure or rejection and “no” do not define who you are as a person. 
 When objections come – and they will come - acknowledge and address them. Life is a negotiation. Be ready to give a little to get closer to what you’re looking to achieve. There is no sin in the word “compromise”. There are times when everything seems to be going against you, objections galore on everything around you. That’s when you have to summon your inner strength, no one else can do this for you, and you need to keep looking it in the face and finding a way to overcome. 
 Stop for a second, cut the noise, isolate the issue at hand and get your point across. Many people will give up when they get resistance, but always remember, that’s where the real work starts. That’s where you show your determination. Do not retreat from the task – even if you fail at first. Keep engaged and keep going. As Winston Churchill said, “If you’re going through hell, keep walking”. 
 You might at times take a step back, that’s OK. You can then advance three. Don’t be rigid. Be flexible. Adjust your stance and get your message across. In life, assertiveness is an important survival skill. 
 And finally, try to add some fun along the way. Even when it is a tough sell, you need to be able to laugh and keep perspective. Try to live life every day. Pay attention to yourself. Don’t forget to live just because you are busy. But, that’s another story. That’s a whole other chapter. Don’t let busy get the best of you because “busy” will ultimately deter you from your goals. 
 Let’s all try to be more in tune to our lives as human beings. Let’s not lose our humanity because we’ve got somewhere to go, something to do. Let’s be there for our families, our friends and others in need.

 Follow Your Calling and Make It Happen 
 ](https://savasvikos.wordpress.com/2014/03/24/follow-your-calling-and-make-it-happen/) 
 Today I want to talk about the people who might at times rain on your parade. Let's say say you plan to start something new, a new endeavor, business, side online business, etc., the moment your close friends and relatives realize this, you start hearing their not so encouraging comments. 
 Are you sure you want to do this? You might be wasting your time and money. Why don't you stick with the "job syndrome", at least you play it safe? That's what they will always say. 
 What would you do at this point? Do you just subside, take a deep breath and stay with the status quo? Or are do you nicely agree to disagree and do it your way? 
 In life all of us know people that persevered against all odds and followed their hearts and made their mark in the world while leading fulfilling lives. Some of us have tried to do certain things to please relatives and friends only to find out that we were not pleasing ourselves. 
 Take my word for it, through years of life observations and not just nearly living, it is better to love what you do than do something for all the wrong reasons. You've heard the expression that when you love something it's not work, time spent this way doesn't matter. You cannot wait to start your day and immerse yourself in your craft. I'm sure you know of people in your circles who no matter how advanced in years, they lead fulfilling lives filled with curiosity and vitality,enjoying what they do. You see that with doctors, actors, artists and entrepreneurs. 
 They live their work, they breathe their work and it does not feel like a job. The goal for all of us is to love what we do. 
 Only a couple of months ago Rita Moreno received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the SAG awards at the young age of 82. She's full of spirit, light, energy and life and is only one of eleven people who have won an Emmy, a Grammy,an Oscar and a Tony. 
 That should tell us something. To great fun and productive lives ahead.
