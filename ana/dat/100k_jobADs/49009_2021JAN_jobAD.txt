 Prayer Request for New Job, Urgently 
 
 Prayer Request for New Job, Urgently 
 by Maurice 
(Cairo, Giza,Egypt) 
 My dear sisters and brothers in Jesus. I had an interview in the last week for a new job. Really, me and my family need that job urgently. As you know in Egypt , it is too difficult for Christian to have higher jobs, please, pray hot and deeply for me, I want Jesus to win for me this time,i hope that Jesus help me and give that job. 
 Yours 
Maurice
