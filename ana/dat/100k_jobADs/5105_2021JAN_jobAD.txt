 Tried & Tested: Josie Maran Argan Hot Oil Self-Heating Hair Treatment 
 Aug 24 
 Posted by  Ashling Moss 
 ✲✲✲ 
 
 Josie Maran's  Argan Hot Oil Self-Heating Hair Treatment  is food for the hair. This innovative hair treatment comes with an advanced self-heating mechanism that allows the miniature argan ampules to warm up under the hot water of your shower or by simply rubbing between the palms of your hands. The oil heats to the ideal temperature to penetrate hair strands and help seal in moisture. 
 Self-heats?  Yes … exactly what I said . 
 Unlike the days of the VO5 Hot Oil Treatments where a scalding cup of water was needed to heat the tube of oil, these self-heat. Simply run one of the ampules under the hot water in your shower or rub vigorously between the palms of your hands, and the oil heats to the perfect temperature. 
 This expert treatment repairs and restores hair in just one minute. Its gentle formula is infused with Maran's signature argan oil, which contains a large amount of vitamin E to reverse damage caused by heat and over-styling, leaving hair smoother, shinier, and healthier. It also contains bergamot, jojoba and soybean oil to restore dull, lackluster hair. 
 Suitable for all hair types and color-treated hair, this is an intense, nourishing treatment. In the shower, I leave the oil in my hair for longer that one minute and sometimes add one ampule to my hair before a day at the beach. It really does a great job of protecting my hair from the sun and saltwater. After the treatment, my hair is noticeably smoother and holds an incredible shine. The individual ampules are great for travel and are resealable, so those with shorter or thinner hair can get 2 or more uses.

 Holy Grail: Vitality Lip Flush 4-in-1 Anti-Aging Lipstick Stain 
 May 18 
 Posted by  Ashling Moss 
 ✺✺✺ 
 
 An all-in-one phenomenon. Combine your favorite lip balm, lipstick, lip gloss and lip stain and you will have IT Cosmetics  Vitality Lip Flush 4-in-1 Anti-Aging Lipstick Stain. 
 IT Cosmetics by Jackie Kern stands for Innovative Technology Cosmetics. It is created with the help of leading plastic surgeons to infuse medical grade makeup with healing skin loving ingredients with cutting edge technology. 
 Unlike anything I have tried before, this lip product creates the most perfect stained lip. The uber moisturizing formula glides on the lips seamlessly and resembles the feeling of a glossy lip balm. After application, lips are stained with a gorgeous "your lips but better" flush. This product comes in 3 different stains: Je Ne Sais Quoi (  crystal   pink  ), Love Story (  mid-range pink  ) and Pretty Woman (  berry  ). 
 This truly innovative lip product contains IT Cosmetics Hydra-Luxe™ Technology which features plum oil, cherry oil, shea butter, aloe, and jojoba that all work together to treat, hydrate, condition, and nourish your lips. It is also packed with anti-oxidants including acai, green tea, white tea, and vitamins A, C, and E to fight free-radicals and minimize the appearance of lip lines and wrinkles. 
 IT Cosmetics  Vitality Lip Flush 4-in-1 Anti-Aging Lipstick Stain  is added to the Holy Grail list for two reasons: texture and color. It is the lip product I have always been looking but did not know existed. Until now.
