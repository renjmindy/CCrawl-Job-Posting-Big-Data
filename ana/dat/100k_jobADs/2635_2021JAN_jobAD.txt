 Good day mam/sir i am sonia 43 years of age from philippines i have 4 children, my educational background was i studied medical technology for about 2years and i graduated at my caregiver course for only 6months I have a certificate from National Certificate for Competency released by Technical Education and Skills Development Authority TESDA of the Philippines.and also certificate of my caregiving course , Many scammers are here here so until now I have difficulty finding a good employer, and who can help me for my visa fee because I donâ€™t have enough money its ok to me if u deduct on my salary.. I want to work in your country in many years because i want to help my family by doing my skill work in caregiver/childcare ,the salary here in philippines was not enough to purchase all we needs and wantsâ€¦ i am working now as medical secretary for about 8years my doctors specialist was pediatrician. i am a flexible person and trustworthy in everyway.. i want to work as caregiver/childcare because it is my skills and i love the way carrying anyone.i am a flexible person and trustworthy in everyway. I'm looking for employers that will help me for my visa fee because I do not have money for the visa fee even if they just deduct my salary its okay to me.. I am a very dependable, trustworthy, patient and caring person. I get great satisfaction out of helping others. I like to think of myself as not only a senior caregiver, but also an senior companion. I enjoy meeting new people and learning new things. I believe that our seniors are a glimpse into our past and should be respected and celebrated. im looking forward to hear you soonâ€¦.thanks and godblessâ€¦
