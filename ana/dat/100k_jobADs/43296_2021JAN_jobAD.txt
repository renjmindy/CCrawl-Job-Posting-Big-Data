 (not satire - it's Iain Duncan Smith!) 
 Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Iain Duncan Smith is claiming that his welfare reforms are  creating jobs . 
 Quite how cutting welfare payments to terminally ill cancer sufferers - for example - is supposed to create jobs, he doesn't quite explain: 
 Deadly delay for cancer patients as thousands are waiting months to get benefits 
 Perhaps he's referring to an uptick in jobs being created in the greetings card, flower delivery and undertaking sectors? 
 And to be fair to Duncan Smith, dying probably  is  quite a good way to  get you off the unemployment figures . 
 Sometimes I think trying to satirise this government is getting to be almost impossible. 
 They satirise themselves so much better than I ever could.

 Hope IDS or his advisors don't come across  http://www.cadaverforsale.com  while surfing the net. Apparently I'm worth about $5500 in spare parts, bit disheartening but I suppose I'm not in showroom condition.

 This article has prominence in both the Telegraph (no comments allowed) and the Guardian (with comments - someone even calls the responses biased!) - sinister or what?

 ah, the tory party - the gift that keeps on giving! 
I've felt justified in calling IBS 'The Minister of Sinister' reading this! (and let's not ignore his sidekick, McVile) 
their suggestion of cutting off a leg to stop a headache is pretty much what expect from this idiot and his dept of incompetants.

 If you haven't done so already, read "Nineteen Eighty-Four" for the explanation!

i read a comments exchanged on twitter the other day that went something like this…the uk is healthy and productive…the responder said the sick and disabled are being hammered, millions are unemployed, food banks are rife etc…the response was that you are bias, and if you cant be positive the uk doesn't want you.

 Almost as good as the screencap I saw today allegedly written by the Better Together campaign which clamed that foodbanks were not, as we all might think, a source of shame for the country in which they proliferate, but rather a sign of just how awesome and charitable that country must be…

 "dying probably is quite a good way to get you off the unemployment figures." 
 Come, come Tom, you've only mentioned half the 'benefit'. Wouldn't every unemployed death raise the figure for percentage in employment? Indeed, many of IDS's policies can be viewed in a similar light - raising stress among those hunting for a job (btw does becoming an electoral candidate count as job hunting?)
