  11 Must-Haves Every Career Girl Needs in Her Bag  
 Ariella Coombs 
 September 28, 2012 
 You're walking into your  interview  when you notice your reflection on a nearby mirror - Your hair is a mess, your eyeliner is smudged, and you're missing an earring! (Turns out rolling down your window while driving 60 MPH on the highway wasn't the best option.) You try to make due with what you have, but running your fingers through your hair can only do so much. Don't get caught unprepared! In addition to your phone and wallet, here are 11 things every  career girl  should have in her bag in case of emergencies: 
 1. Emergency Make-Up Kit 
 Rough night? Need to touch up? No problem! A make-up emergency kit is definitely a must-have item for your bag. Tuck a little cover up, mascara, and lip gloss away just in case. Oh, and don’t forget a handheld mirror! 
 2. Hand Lotion 
 In the business world, you will be doing a lot of handshaking, and no one wants to shake a hand that’s dry and chapped - Ew! Make sure to have your favorite yummy smelling lotion on hand (pun intended!). 
 3. Mini Notebook 
 Every career girl needs to carry around a mini notebook. This makes it easy to write down all of those brilliant ideas that come to you while riding the bus or drinking your coffee. 
 4. Hairbrush 
 It's a beautiful day and you can't resist but to roll down the windows on the highway. But wait! Now you're hair is in a rats nest and you've got a presentation in 10 minutes. Make sure you've got your trusty hair brush in your purse in case of these kinds of emergencies. 
 5. Perfume 
 Although it's not wise to overdo it, having a mini bottle of perfume is a good thing to have when you go in for an interview. Freshening up before can help you feel more confident. Just make sure the scent you choose isn't overwhelming. 
 6. Mints 
 On that note, you should always, always, always have mints or gum stashed in your bag! You never want to be the one caught with bad breathe when meeting with a client or talking with  co-workers . Not cool. And, if you really want, you can toss a couple of flossers in your bag, too, so that delicious lunch you just had doesn’t haunt you (other others) later in the day! 
 7. Hand Sanitizer 
 Germs are everywhere and you never know who is sick at the office. Tuck a little bottle of hand sanitizer or to-go wipes so you can stay fresh and healthy. 
 8. Extra Earrings 
 I always seem to forget to put in earrings. However, I try to keep a spare pair in my bag so I can always look my best. Simple, versatile studs or pearls are great backup choices. 
 9. Business Cards 
 You never know who you're going to meet, and the last thing you want to do is leave an important contact with contact information on a ripped napkin. Make sure to keep a stash of business cards in your wallet just in case. 
 10. Energy Bar 
 When you're running around doing errands and meeting clients, you need to keep your energy levels up. Having something to chew on can help you regain your energy and focus, especially if it has protein AND chocolate! 
 11. Phone Charger 
 Forgot to plug in your phone last night? If you have a spare charger in your bag at all times, you don't have to worry about that annoying low-battery noise anymore.  What are your must-haves for your bag?   Image Credit: Shutterstock
