 6 Questions You Should Ask Yourself Before Accepting a Job Offer (2 min read) 
 August 15, 2017   Millennial Mindset   18 Comments

 Whether you are an active job seeker or not, the idea of committing to a future working in the unchartered territory is stressful! Saying yes to a job that doesn't support your career goals may reduce your motivation and add unnecessary stress to your life. But saying no may mean missed opportunities for personal and professional growth! 
 Here are a few questions to ask yourself before saying "YES!" to a new job. 
 1. What is your motivation for accepting a new job? 
 Hate the job you're in? Jumping at the first job offer you get may lead you to hate that job too. Looking to expand your experience? Make sure that you'll be getting the experience you want before saying yes! Time for a change? Change is good, go for it! 
 2. What are your short-term goals in a job? 
 Do you want to improve your client service skills? Learn more about human resources? Short term goals are just as important as long-term goals. Identify some short term goals to help steer you toward your end goal. 
 3. What is your career end goal? 
 It's okay if you don't know. Pick a 'ballpark' end goal. Do you want to manage people? Be a successful writer? Teach? Be an expert in accounting? Identify what you are working towards and start building the path thereby accepting jobs that will help with your personal and professional development. 
 4. Will this job add valuable skills and experience to your resume? 
 Any experience is a good experience. But don't settle for just any experiences. What skills and experiences can this job offer you that will help you reach your short-term and long-term career goals? 
 5. What do you value most in a job? 
 Do you value autonomy? Challenges? Opportunities to work in a team environment? Do some research. Interview your interviewer and find out if your values are the right fit for the job they are offering you. 
 6. What work-related activities keep you from staring at the clock? 
 Do project base activities keep you engaged all day? Maybe math related work makes time fly by. Identify what you love to do at work, and identify the things you hate while you're at it. If you've been offered an administrative opportunity, and you hate administrative tasks, pass on the job and find another, more enjoyable way to add those skills to your resume. 
 Choose wisely and aim for the stars!

 7 Tips for Building Your Business While Working Your Day Job (2 min read) 
 August 14, 2017   Millionaire's Digest   53 Comments 
 1. Commit yourself to your dream. 
 Having the desire for something to work vs. committing to it are vastly different. When you commit to your dream, you are making a binding obligation to see it through to success. It means you are “all in,” you find solutions when faced with obstacles and you don’t quit, no matter what. Make that pledge to yourself, and then tell the people in your life.

 Titles and job descriptions are a sophisticated tangled web of ambiguous words to show folks what one does. We plaster titles on our social media pages, resumes and tout them on business cards. No matter who you are or what you do, you have some sort of title.
