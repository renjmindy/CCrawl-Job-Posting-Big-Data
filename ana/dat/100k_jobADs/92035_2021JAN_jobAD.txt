 On The Job Injury Lawyer Hauppauge 
 If you have been hurt while at work, you should consider speaking with a skilled on the job injury lawyer Hauppauge provides from Polsky, Shouldice & Rosen, P.C. in order to gain the compensation you deserve. Workers compensation was put into place in order to provide wage replacement and medical benefits to hard workers who are injured during the course of their employment. Since 1991 we have been dedicated to helping those who have been injured at work and believe they are not receiving the right amount of wage replacement they deserve. 
 Unfortunately, accidents will always happen. When they do, you should be able to trust that your company will be there to support you during this hard time. However, companies (and their insurers) do not always have employees’ best interest in mind. You may want to contact a  on the job injury lawyer Hauppauge  offers who does. 
 What Workers Compensation Does For You 
 Workers compensation, also known as workman’s comp, has four major disability compensation programs to help federal workers and their dependants. According to the Department of Labor’s OWPC, this would include: 
 
 Wage allowance benefits 
 Proper medical care 
 Vocational rehabilitation 
 Other benefits 
 
 If you’ve been injured at work under any circumstance, you may want to seek legal guidance from a Hauppauge on the job injury lawyer at Polsky, Shouldice & Rosen, P.C. Our lawyers understand the difficulties employees endure when they cannot return to work due to an injury. Whether it is severe or minor, an injury that occurs during a work-related task may qualify you for workers compensation coverage. 
 When You Are Covered 
 Even though there are some conditions that do not allow for workers compensation to be used, there are several incidents where a worker may file a claim successfully. 
 When an accident occurs at work and you are injured, or when you are injured while performing a job-related task 
When you develop an injury due to overuse of a muscle over an extended period of time for a job-related task 
Becoming ill or obtaining a disease because of work 
 Employees in any industry can become seriously injured due to work-related issues. When this occurs, the individual might not be able to work for a long time, or in some cases, not return to work again. A on the job injury lawyer Hauppauge workers depend on may help you secure the financial compensation you need if your injury has made you unable to work. 
 When You Are Not Covered 
 Workers compensation is designed to cover most job-related injuries, even if an injury was caused by the employee’s own carelessness. However, there are situations in which workers compensation is not applicable. 
 
 Being intoxicated or using illegal drugs while at work 
 Self-inflicted harm 
 If you acquire an injury at work while committing a serious crime 
 If your conduct violated the company's policy 
 If your company is exempt from federal and/or state laws and is not required to hold a workers compensation policy
