 Launch and own business unit for our new product 
 Role overview 
 As Healthie's lead for our newest product, you'll work directly with Healthie's CTO and CEO to develop and execute a go-to-market strategy. You will directly own the entire customer lifecycle, be responsible for product launch, own the marketing, sales, and success, have direct input into product development and evolution, and have unlimited opportunity to build and grow a key business unit. 
 This is an incredible growth opportunity for the right candidate. 
 You'll partner closely with our leadership to build out processes and best practices to support our customers, identify and manage leads, and build supporting documentation and resources to help prospective and current customers. 
 You are a strong candidate for this role if you have that unique combination of technical expertise plus ability to, and interest in, working with engineers and CTOs to incorporate a new API into their workflows. 
 What you will do 
 
 Develop clear positioning and messaging around our key products and features 
 Generate high-quality content and overviews that clearly communicate the usage and value of the product (e.g blog posts, API documentation, sample code) 
 Identify and execute ways to find and communicate with qualified sales leads 
 Provide continuous feedback to Healthie's product and engineering teams and stay current on product releases and roadmap features 
 Maintain a deep understanding of Healthie's product feature set and the growing API landscape 
 Engage with customers to ensure successful implementation, provide suggestions for improved and increased utilization 
 Document customer implementations and configurations 
 Serve as a consultant, providing excellent customer service and maintaining excellent customer relationships. 
 Identify, ticket and resolve customer issues in a timely manner, working with product engineering team as needed 
 Develop internal and external processes and workflows to increase efficiencies across the user customer onboarding journey. 
 
 Who you are 
 A variety of backgrounds may be a good fit for this role, but you are likely a compelling fit if: 
 
 A   self-starting software engineer at heart   .  You will be playing ball with incredibly talented CTOs, and while you won't be in the building weeds yourself on a day-to-day, need to know how to provide support and recommendations to customers 
 Empathetic to our customers and their needs.  Youâ€™ve been in a customer-facing role before, whether in marketing, sales, or success, and can lead business conversations with confidence. 
 A strategic thinker who can also execute on strategy.  You are able to navigate seamlessly between thinking high-level and understanding business strategy / goals and executing on a daily basis to achieve your goals. 
 A relentless   troubleshooter   .  No problem too tough, no issue too elusive; we are looking for someone who will tackle a customer deployment or implementation problem and work through it, rather than around it. 
 
 We are hiring US-based candidates for this remote role with a preference toward candidates in the NYC area as the role will require East coast working hours.
