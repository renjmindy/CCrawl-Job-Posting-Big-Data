 Applicant Benefits 
 
 "I had contacted Worknet Staffing because my company was transporting my position to the corporate office in another state. I would have had to uproot my family and my wife would have had to give up her career which she has worked so hard to achieve. Worknet Staffing was able to find me a position in Lafayette within my field of expertise much more quickly than I had hoped for allowing me to continue doing what I have grown to enjoy."
