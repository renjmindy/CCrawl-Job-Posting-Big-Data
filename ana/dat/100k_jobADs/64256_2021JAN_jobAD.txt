 According to recent news,  STX Finland  and  Scandlines  , the Danish-German company which is one of Europeâ€™s largest ferry operator, have announced that two new ferries will be built by the  Rauma  and  Turku  shipyards. This project is estimated to create approximately  1,000 shipyard jobs in southwest Finland  , primarily in the Rauma area. 
 STX Finlandâ€™s EVP, Mr.  Timo Suistio  recently commented in an interview that the projectâ€™s total cost is around a few hundred million Euros and negotiations are currently underway with the two shipyards. 
 The new ferries will be running on  low-emission LNG  instead of the traditional fuel and are due for completion in  2015 .Â They are scheduled to operate along the route between Rostock in Germany and Gedser in Denmark. 
 Each ferryâ€™s capacity will be 1,300 passengers and 72 trucks or 382 cars.
