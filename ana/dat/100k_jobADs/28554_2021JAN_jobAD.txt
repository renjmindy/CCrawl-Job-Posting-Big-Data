  3 Simple Steps To Changing Careers And Exceeding Your Wildest 2015 Dreams  
 Ryan Niessen 
 January 08, 2015 
 What does the New Year mean to you?  Related:   3 Solid Strategies For Changing Careers  If  you’re a high achiever  and you’re one of the 70% of people the Gallup poll reports being “disengaged” (aka:  bored out of your mind  ) with your job, then it may mean the turning of a new page in the book of your life... Saying “goodbye” to the old you - the one who accepted their fate for far too long and is fed up. And ringing in the New Year - starting at this moment, right now - by  deciding that you’re worth more.  You can do more. You can  earn more  ,  have more fun  , and  make more money.  There’s something waiting for you at the bottom of this article that’ll help you with the next steps. First, you need to figure out where you’re going. 
 
 3 Simple Steps To Changing Careers & Exceeding Your Wildest 2015 Dreams... 
 
 "Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?" "That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat. "I don’t much care where--" said Alice. "Then it doesn’t matter which way you go," said the Cat. "--so long as I get SOMEWHERE," Alice added as an explanation. "Oh, you’re sure to do that," said the Cat, "if you only walk long enough." 
 - Exchange between Alice & the Cheshire Cat in Alice in Wonderland) 
 
 We’re all going to get somewhere - however, as it’s also said in  Alice in Wonderland  , "If you don't know where you're going, any road'll take you there." So, let’s dive into the three simple steps and make sure you don’t end up “somewhere," shall we? 
 Step 1: Identify Your Point “A” 
 If you’re standing in the middle of a desert and say, “I want to go to Florida and get a beachfront home and live forever in peace beside the ocean," but you have no idea where you are right now… then you’re clueless about which direction to go! You’re lost. Wandering aimlessly,  hoping  you find Florida one day. So the first step is to figure out exactly where you are. That means taking the time to find a peaceful place, and looking at your life with a brutally honest eye. Where are doing well? Where can you improve? Are you happy with your career? What do you like about your job? What do you hate? You can only figure out how to move forward when you have a clear and honest picture of your life. 
 Step 2: Identify Your Point “B” 
 Point “B” is your destination: Florida. Working for Google. Working from a condo on the beach. Whatever your dream is, it’s time to get 100% clear on what kind of life, and career, you want. This is an incredibly fun process, but it can be overwhelming at the same time. You’ve got to figure out what your most important values are. What your biggest strengths and passions are. And then, how to translate those things into a job you love, that makes a positive impact in the world, and pays what you deserve. 
 Step 3: Find & Get Your Dream Job 
 After all that reflecting, there’s good news. It’s actually easier to find a great employer, get their attention, and get the job than it is to complete the first two steps. Since it’s proven that we’re happier and more fulfilled when we feel like we’re making a difference in the world, I’d suggest you start by checking out the  GameChangers 500  list of the world’s top purpose-driven companies. It includes inspiring organizations like TOMS shoes, Google, Patagonia, and Whole Foods. In fact, my business partner at  The Gateway Method  (where we help people find and get purpose-driven jobs) is the founder of the GameChangers 500… And we’ve put together a  special video for you here  sharing three practical tips you can apply today to find and get a “Game-Changing” job. I’d recommend you  watch it before you apply for a position  with one of these “purpose-driven” companies, because they’re fundamentally different from traditional businesses (and traditional job-seeking tactics won’t work with them). So remember: You can exceed your wildest dreams in 2015. Start by identifying your point “A” and point “B." Then, take action to find and get your dream job. I wish you the best of luck, and a Game-Changing New Year.
