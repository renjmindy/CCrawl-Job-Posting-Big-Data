 Entry to carpentry and cabinet making jobs is generally through an apprenticeship. A high school education to at least Year 10 is a common pre-requisite. Apprentices learn skills on the job and through off-the-job training with a Registered Training Organisation. 
 Most apprenticeships take four years to complete. School-based apprenticeships are available which allow students to begin training for carpentry and cabinet making jobs while still studying. Pre-apprenticeships and pre-vocational courses can also provide a gateway into this field by increasing chances of gaining an apprenticeship.
