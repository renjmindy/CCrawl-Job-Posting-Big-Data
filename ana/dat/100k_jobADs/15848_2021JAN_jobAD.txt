 Okay 
 Sweet Baby Jason! it's a Full-time job 
 Here's the deal: Giant Spoon is looking for a CD Team to be a part of our team in our New York, USA office. It's rooted in NY but can be anywhere in the US really..... 
 About 
 Looking for a full time CD team with narrative story telling chops. Experience in traditional brand including films a must. An interest in innovation is a bonus at Giant Spoon as well. Have a collaborative attitude as you'll be working across departments. Art Director must have kick ass visuals, almost design minded. The copywriter has to be able to turn a line and write some killer scripts and manifestos. All sounds obvious but worth reiterating :) 
 Ideal candidates should be...... 
- Iconoclastic in thinking! 
-CD AD has a great design aesthetic and sensibilities. 
-CD CW, craft beautiful scripts (film/ story telling) and a nice to have would be able to tap into some humor 
-Both should have modern sensibilities 
-Experience in cross platform from traditional to experiential 
-Have some experience in Tech, Travel, some CPG 
-Can be remote but will be working with NY team
