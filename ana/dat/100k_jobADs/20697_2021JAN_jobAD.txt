 I start every day with the motivational words of Dre Baldwin. The book and podcast provides focus and a reminder of what's important right now. There are a lot of people that coach and motivate but there's something special about hearing the right message at the right time that's priceless. The icing on the cake is that this material is poetic in the sense that the gold is in the brevity. It hits you right in the heart and stands back and says now what are you prepared to do to change.

 While looking for resources to help improve the confidence of my 13 year old scholar athlete son, I came across the YouTube page of Dre. I viewed several videos and almost immediately found one on in-game nervousness that on point addressed the issues that my son was struggling with on the court and off. He viewed that video and started the mental work that Dre describes in that video. Less than a week later, he had one of his best games this session. It is now routine that we as a family view a video or listen to a podcast and discuss in a positive open way. It is helping my Sports Dad husband to understand he can’t want this more. We all know this, but sometimes you need to really hear the message relayed from someone who has been down the path of an athlete. Dre is able to make a connection with athletes that are far better than a lecture from Mom and Dad. His messages truly apply to not only sports, but school and life as well.

 ... HELPING ME BUILD UP THE CONFIDENCE I NEEDED TO FINALLY LAUNCH MY PODCAST 
 Hey Dre, The reason for this email is to express my sincere appreciation and admiration for the dedication you have for your craft. I've been following you for a little over two years now. I own several books of yours and I also purchased your Bullet Proof Mindset Course. But the thing that's helped me the most is your PODCAST. I learned so much from The WOYG Podcast that it made me want to start my own. I wanted to do for others what you did for me. I wanted to for two years but I didn't! There's a bunch of excuses for why I didn't, but not a single good reason. The only thing that was in my way was me. But I finally got sick and tired of being sick and tired, so I decided to take action. I posted my 4th podcast episode yesterday.I have you to thank for that! Thank you for your content! & Thank you for helping me build up the confidence I needed to finally launch my podcast. (P.s. it's even rated 5 Stars on Apple Podcast :) ) 
 - Flor, Podcaster

 A GREAT RESOURCE COACHING BASKETBALL AT A DIV 3 SCHOOL 
 Just finished book over the weekend—thanks so much for all the great info. It will be a great resource coaching at a Div 3 school---I know our best player from this season is trying to continue to play. Looking forward to sharing the info—great thoughts on mental toughness. Thanks again, 
 - Brad Oringer, College Basketball Coach 
 Dre, 
 As I heaved and mounted my backpack onto my shoulders, while making my way out of class and into my university's library, earlier today -- I pulled out my Mac and began to search for sports books, simply for consumption purposes. 
 And by search, I don't mean in a feverish manner. I was seeking a book for the plain purpose of enhancing my knowledge in either baseball, basketball, football -- a tad bit more. 
 Before I move forward, I must confess: I’ve never considered myself to be an avid reader. I don’t have an exact count, but throughout my 22 years of life, I’ve purchased approximately 10 to 15 books -- having only read two in its entirety, and most of them having been open once or twice since its acquisition. 
 Now, back to my anecdote. 
 I had been scrolling through several sports-related books in about six minutes or so, up until I came across ‘Work on Your Game.’ Although I love playing sports as much as I enjoy watching sporting events, I never once played on a team -- nor at school or on an organized league. Despite residing right across my high school, I always belittled the same processes that led to your retirement as a professional basketball player -- as noted in the intro section of your book. 
 As you can possibly already denote, we possess some of the similarities, as described in your book. I am a 22 year-old college senior, vying for his marketing degree. 
 The purpose of this message/email, however, is not to iterate a synopsis about my college experience. The only sector that is important for you to know is that I’m in good educational standing and will be walking this coming May. 
 As I encountered your book, I instantly knew I had to give it a chance. Obviously, I had no clue about the book, nor about yourself -- which means that I’ve only known about you for about a couple of hours. 
 As I try to find my to the table of contents, expecting to encounter in-depth analysis about the game of basketball, I commence noticing a trend regarding personal improvement -- such as ‘Eliminate Self-Consciousness And Performance Anxiety, Forever’ and ‘Selling Yourself.’ 
 As of right now, I’m midway through Chapter 1 of your book, and decided I needed to come and personally thank you for taking the chance to assort your life experiences and success framework on this exceptional piece of work. 
 I was touched by your anecdote regarding your post-grad conversation you had with both of your parents about your intentions to live out your dreams as a professional basketball player. As someone who shares an entrepreneurial mindset myself, I plan on having that same conversation with my parents, which I know will be tough.
