 Are you a world class Operations Manager with an engineering background and a strong CI skillset, who has already made the transition into SME, privately-owned manufacturing? Do you have a track record leading cultural change and processes improvement? 
 I'm currently recruiting for a privately-owned, precision manufacturing business with a rich history and an exciting future, based in Marston Green in Birmingham. A small-batch manufacturer of a market-leading range of products, this family-owned business has appointed a Managing Director from an external pool of candidates and tasked him with reorganising, re-energising and growing their historically successful business, bringing modern and innovative thinking in order to take it into the next phase of its history. 
 The Operations Manager will work with clear bandwidth, able to prioritise and drive daily production targets, while underpinning this each day with the development of the factory, implementing lean tools and modern manufacturing techniques resulting in an improved shop floor, increased efficiency and reduced costs. 
 You will have learned your trade in a world class manufacturing organisation, but critically you'll have already transformed a manufacturing operation within a small to medium sized business. You're passionate about what you do and making a difference is what gets you out of bed - you're going to go on a journey with the MD, with a genuine opportunity for you to become Operations Director in the future as a result of your success transforming the factory. 
 The successful candidate will receive a salary of £55,00 to £65,000 plus benefits. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
