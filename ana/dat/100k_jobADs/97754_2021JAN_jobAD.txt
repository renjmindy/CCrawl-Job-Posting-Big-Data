  Job Offer Feels All Wrong But My Parents Say Take It!  
 Work It Daily 
 April 21, 2009 
 Dear Experts, I'm about to graduate from college with a degree in History. I'll be honest, my parents weren't thrilled about my major choice because they couldn't envision me getting a job that would pay the bills with it. Well, thanks to the economy, they are right. I've been job hunting a lot in the last two months and realize there isn't a lot out there. On top of that, I don't really have a sense of what I want to do. But my parents are on my case that I have to find a job. I finally got a call from a company I applied to online. I went to the interview and everything about the job seems wrong. It's a sales job and I just don't see myself enjoying it. Some how, in spite of my lack of enthusiasm in the interview, I got offered the job. It pays a salary and my parents are being very vocal that I must take this job. Yet, just the thought of it makes me sick to my stomach. What should I do?
