 Good News for HVAC Jobs in 2014 
 Posted on  January 1, 2015  by  MyOpenJobs 
 When we reported on  HVAC jobs last year , both employment and salaries were excellent as revealed by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The good news this year is that salaries have gone up. Just check out these statistics from the same government agency: 
 
 
 The 251,700 HVAC mechanics in the country average $46,110 per year, or $22.17 per hour. The lowest paid employees receive less than an annual $27,210, or $13.08 hourly, while the top 10 percent earn over $69,740 a year, or $33.53 an hour. 
 
 
 Over 70 percent of mechanics work for building equipment contractors with a mean salary of $44,680 per year, or $21.48 per hour. Direct selling establishments ranks second with over 3 percent of the jobs and a mean wage of $47,220 annually, or $22.70 hourly. 
 
 
 The best paying employers are other information services such as website services and digital libraries. They average $78,600 per year, or $37.79 per hour. Second for pay is waste treatment and disposal, averaging an annual $68,860, or $33.11 an hour. 
 
 
 Florida has most of the jobs with 22,160 of the positions and mean pay at $40,720, or $19.58 an hour. Texas is a close second with 22,060 positions averaging $41,810 annually, or $20.10 hourly. The state with the highest pay is Alaska at a mean $62,210 a year, or $29.91 an hour. Next is the District of Columbia, which the BLS considers a state. The average salary here is $60,310 annually, or $29 hourly. 
 
 
 The BLS sees jobs for HVAC mechanics increasing by 21 percent from 2012 to 2022.  This is higher than the projected 11 percent growth for all jobs in all industries.
