 The Republic of Bullshit 
 ** 
 Lately it occurred to me that maybe instead of 
complaining about my poor financial situation 
that perhaps I should try to find some sort of 
job that I could do in spite of my medical 
condition. 
 So I started putting my resume out on the 
internet. Well, yesterday I finally got a hit. 
It seems the Dole Corporation is very interested 
in hiring me. 
 My job would consist of putting the labels on 
bunches of bananas. That's pretty much it. The 
bananas come down the line and I reach out and 
put the Dole stickers on them. 
 Of course the job would entail that I move 
to the Philippines. I'm not really happy about 
that given that I hate jungles and bugs and 
hot weather. But a man's got to do what a 
man's got to do. 
 Interested in a job with Dole? 
Call 1-800-232-8888.

 ðŸ˜† I worked at the post office for two weeks entering zip codes. I was hired for a four hour shift 7 to 11. They constantly (like every fifteen minutes) had anouncements going off on the pa system which fouled me up every time. Then they had your id numbers with your speed up on the bulletin board and anyone with a certain speed had to go faster. After the first week, there was mandatory two hours overtime which got me home around 2am. Didn't like that one bit. Funny thing is, it took me two weeks more to stop putting more numbers on the time whenever I looked at the clock.

 You know A. if I do a good job there's always the possibility that I would get promoted to putting the stickers on pinapples. In which case they would transfer me to Hawaii and my Opera friends could all come and lay on the beach.

 ðŸ˜† Hey I could do that too. I've actually looked at jobs where I'd be in sort of an assembly line and do one thing, then hand it to the next person. I'd be fired the first day because my mind wanders too much and I'd be thinking 'oh I wonder what it would look like if I put it there instead of here'. I'd be the link that would foul up the line for sure.

 It reminds me of the good old days when I was employed at the coffee machine factory assembling coffee machines and putting them in boxes. Back then, I was also engaged in a political movement, and I was infact the only bonified 'worker' in the group. The rest was university students. Which ment, I had a certain status among them. I soon left the movement because there was too far a distance between the ideals of those students (all coming from rich families, never had to fight or work for anything) to the harsh existence of some of my co-workers at the factory. Plus, drinking beers with my colleagues was more fun than drinking beers with my commerades in the organisationâ€¦ Good luck finding a new job. With your new Blackberry thing, more money might come in handy.

 Give my regards to the Philippines.Many years ago I had a job where I was supposed to put stamps on envelopes. That sucked.But then again I couldn't eat the envelopes.

 @ Martin.I was in a similar organization back in the mid 70s. We were all students. Vietnam had just ended and pretty much nobody was interested in hearing about anything even vaugely political. Everybody just wanted to forget the world, do a little drugs, and jump on board the love train. I eventually became jaded and ended up in that group myself. In fact I'm pretty much still in that group. @ Allan.Stamps on envelopes. That is a very difficult scientific skill requiring years to master. I myself like to get the stamps on envelopes perfectly placed in the corner with an identical distance (usually about 1/4 of an inch) between the top/right edge of the stamp and the top/right edge of an envelope. As a consequence it takes me about two minutes to put a stamp on an envelope. And don't even get me started on seeling the envelope.

 You don't have to lick the stamps anymore. At the postoffice you can get stamps that already are sticky, and you can apply them on the letter just like that. You don't have to lick them on the backside to make sure they stick. Like politicians.

 I can't remember exactly due to my Memory Access Syndrome but I think I put a stamp on an envelope a couple of months ago. For some reason.
