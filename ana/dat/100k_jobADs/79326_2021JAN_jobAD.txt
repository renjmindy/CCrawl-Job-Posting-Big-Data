 How To Network During Coronavirus 
     J.T. O'Donnell 
 and 
     Work It Daily 
 April 21, 2020 
 Whether you've been laid off, or are afraid you might be, you need to be prepared. 
 
 If you want to find a new job you MUST build a networking strategy. 
 "It's those meaningful connections, those meaningful conversations that you have with people, that builds the trust, that earns the respect, that gets people to want to mobilize and help you. And same for you - the more you get to talk to people, have meaningful conversations, the more inspired you are to want to find a way to help them so that everybody wins." 
 So, how do you network during a time of social distancing? What can you do to make a great impression and become a valuable connection? 
 In this episode, I'll tell you the importance of networking during a crisis like COVID-19, and how to network effectively.
