 Okay 
 Sweet Baby Jason! it's a Internship job 
 Butter Studio is looking for an Intern Design Intern in Remote. Not an ordinary Intern Design Intern but the kind of Intern Design Intern that makes other Intern Design Interns question their Intern Design Intern-ness. 
 About 
 Butter is seeking a highly motivated and talented design intern to join the studio now or starting next semester. You will learn the ins and outs of working with a small design firm and be actively involved in all aspects of our creative process. This is an opportunity to learn what it’s like to work for a design studio, hone your craft, and develop your design skills while working on real life applications. We’re looking for design students or those early in their design careers whose aesthetic resonates with ours, who have excellent typography, graphic design, motion graphics, brand, web, and illustration skills. 
 Please apply to hello@butterstudio.co with your portfolio, resume, quick note of why you're a good fit, and ideal start date. 
 We are looking to meet folks to partner with immediately or starting next semester, in January. 
 We're a queer and female led studio creating values-driven work with brands we admire.
