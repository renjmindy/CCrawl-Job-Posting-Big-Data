 Filing for Unemployment Insurance Benefits 
 The Workforce Centers of South Central Kansas can not process Unemployment Insurance Claims. 
 Information from the Department of Labor – The fastest way to determine your Unemployment Insurance eligibility is to use the online filing system. You may  file your initial claim application online  at  www.GetKansasBenefits.gov . If you have already filed for benefits, information about your claim is also available from the website. By using your personal password, you can obtain details about your claim status, payment dates and amounts. 
 Need to speak with a UI Benefits Representative? Try these tips: 
 
 Expect wait times due to an unprecedented number of claims. 
 UI Representatives ask for your patience. Please understand they are doing their best to assist all callers as quickly as possible. 
 Wait times are typically shorter on Wednesdays and Thursdays, but with the magnitude of calls coming into the contact center they are experiencing long wait times every day of the week. 
 Call center representatives can only discuss your unemployment claim with you. Please do not have a family member or friend call with questions about your claim, as they cannot give them any information. 
 
 The Kansas Unemployment Contact Center is available Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. You can reach the Contact Center by calling one of the following phone numbers: 
 
 Kansas City – (913) 596-3500 
 Topeka – (785) 575-1460 
 Wichita – (316) 383-9947 
 All other areas – (800) 292-6333 FREE 
 
 NOTE: When calling for assistance, you will need the PIN you created when you first applied for unemployment benefits and your Social Security Number. 
 If you have already been approved to receive unemployment benefits and you have questions specifically regarding your Unemployment Benefits Debit Card please visit  https://prepaid.bankofamerica.com/KDOLDebitCard/  or contact BPA toll-free Customer Service number at 800.292.6333 FREE.
