 Mozilla Careers Page 
 Mozilla's premier destination for finding engineering jobs was in need of a major update to correspond to its recent rebrand: fresh, exciting, bold and relevant. The previous page hadn't been updated in more than a few years and since it was important to attract new talent, Mozilla's grand producer and I devised a documented process to hit the ground running and set us up for success. The team was used to diving into wireframe creation, but I decided to introduce our squad to a beautiful thing called "priority guides". Once we knew what we were solving for and how content should be prioritized, the next step was to resume with wireframes and design. I create a few icons, but the heavy lifting on graphics is credited to Mozilla's stunning branded assets that accompanied the redesign. The final result did not look like a landing page deployed by a tech companyâ€”and for that, I am so very proud of the work the team and I did to make sure that was the case.
