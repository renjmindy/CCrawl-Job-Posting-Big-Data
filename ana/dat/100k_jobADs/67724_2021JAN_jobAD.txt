  Career Prep: Recommend Friend’s Boyfriend for a Job?  
 Work It Daily 
 October 23, 2012 
 Job search takes practice – just like studying for the SAT. That’s why we came up with daily  Career Prep  questions to help you “study” for your job search! Here’s today’s question: Abby’s roommate, Ella has a new boyfriend. They’ve been together for three months. Abby has only met him a few times. Recently, he lost his  job . It’s hard to tell why. Ella’s reasoning doesn’t make sense to Abby. Today, Ella asked Abby to take in her boyfriend’s resume to her company. He saw they were hiring and remembered Abby worked there. Ella wants Abby to put in a good word for him, even though Abby doesn’t really know him. [poll id="71"]  Image Credit: Shutterstock
