  Keep Land Registry public campaign wins 100,000 backers  
 More than 100,000 people have backed a campaign to keep the  Land Registry  in public ownership. 
 The Government held a consultation on the future of the 150-year-old institution, which handles land and property data and employs more than 400 civil servants in  Durham City  , earlier this year, with critics warning privatisation, huge job cuts, loss of confidence and higher charges for the public could follow. 
 At the weekend, a national newspaper reported Business Secretary  Vince Cable  had vetoed any sell-off, said to be worth around £1.2bn, as ‘  just too complicated’ . 
 A spokesman for the  Department for Business, Innovation and Skills  said the Government would publish its response to the consultation shortly. 
 Now  Durham City  Labour MP  Roberta Blackman-Woods  has joined Labour’s shadow business minister  Toby Perkins  , leaders of the  Public and Commercial Services  (PCS) union and campaign group  38 Degrees  in presenting a 100,000-name signature calling for the Registry to remain in the public sector to the Government. 
 Durham’s Land Registry office is said to be worth £10m a year to the local economy. 
 Dr Blackman-Woods said: “  The Land Registry office in Durham provides many good jobs that we need locally and I don’t want this to be diminished in any way by potential privatisation.” 
 Previously, business minister  Michael Fallon  said giving the Land Registry more flexibility would allow it to support economic growth in the wider economy.
