 Old Sheets for Dirty Jobs Video 
 Posted on  July 21, 2014  by  dancarpenter1985 
 A few months ago I did a reading for the marvellous Story Sessions (part of  Saboteur award  winning organisation  Arachne Press ). Through this link you can see me reading from my short story Old Sheets for Dirty Jobs, which was published by  Boo Books  in their anthology, After the Fall. 
 
 The video is  here .
