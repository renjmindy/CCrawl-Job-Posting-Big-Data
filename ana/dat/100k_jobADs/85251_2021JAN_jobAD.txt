 My FTSE 100 client are currently looking to expand their service team to 10.

As a specialist provider of this kind of machinery my client design, assemble and sell to the sites you will be attending. This level of service is what makes them unique and the only company in the UK that performs a cradle to grave solution. 
 What are the expectations of a Service Engineer to work for my client…

 In return for your experience and knowledge my client offers a base salary of £40,000 plus phone, tablet, laptop, car and pension matched up to 6%. The car will come with a fuel card of which will enable you to use for both business and personal. You will be contracted to 37.5 hours a week with any hours worked outside of this paid as overtime. Monday to Friday overtime is paid at a flat rate however Saturday to Sunday is paid at 1.75 which offers you an OTE of £50,000 - £55,000.
