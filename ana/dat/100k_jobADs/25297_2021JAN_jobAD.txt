 What is a robotics engineer? 
 Robotics engineering is a field of engineering which centers on building machines that replicate human actions. A robotics engineer creates these applications or autonomous machines (aka robots) for industries such as mining, manufacturing, automotive, services and more. Often, the goal is to program machines to do repetitive, hazardous or unhealthy jobs. 
 What does a robotics engineer do? 
 A robotics engineer designs prototypes, builds and tests machines, and maintains the software that controls them. They also conduct research to find the most cost-efficient and safest process to manufacture their robotic systems. 
 Robotics engineer job duties include: 
 
 Conducting research in various robotics fields (e.g. nanotechnology) 
 Designing processes and prototypes to build machines 
 Testing robotic systems
