 Eddie Albert: From "Grace & Eddie" to "Green Acres" 
 There are many ways to skin a cat.  Edward Albert Heimberger 's  (1906-2005) pathway to the top in show business was unconventional but it got him there. The kid who would become "  Eddie Albert "  grew up in Minneapolis, where he went to high school with  Ann Sothern , and belonged to the drama club. He studied business at the University of Minnesota, but then the Depression hit, and he found himself doing a wide variety of odd jobs. But he stayed close to show business. He was a clown, high-wire, and trapeze performer in Escalante Brothers Circus. He sang in night clubs. 
 Eddie and Grace prepping for one of the earliest tv broadcasts, 1936! 
 By 1933 he was co-starring in the popular NBC radio show  The Honeymooners/ Grace and Eddie Show  with  Grace Bradt  (no connection to the later  Jackie Gleason  program). The show ran three years. In 1936, he and Bradt also participated in one of the first ever television broadcasts, an NBC experiment that also featured  Ed Wynn,   Hildegarde ,  The Ink Spots   ,  and  Betty Goodwin. 
 Radio success led to Broadway -- which is kind of the opposite of the way it usually worked in those days. He starred in four shows in the late '30s:  O Evening Star  (1936);  Brother Rat  (1936-38);  Room Service  (1937-38, in the part played by  Frank Albertson  in the  Marx Brothers' version ); and  The Boys from Syracuse  (1938-39). Next came the first phase of his Hollywood career (1938-1943), including the film version of  Brother Rat  (1938) and its sequel  Brothers Rat and a Baby  (1940), as well as the film version of the music  On Your Toes  (1939), and about a dozen other films. 
 He served in the Coast Guard and the Navy during World War II, earning a Bronze Star for his service as a Lieutenant during the Invasion of Tarawa. 
 In 1945 he married Mexican actress María Marguerita Guadalupe Teresa Estela Bolado Castilla y O'Donnell, known professionally as  "Margo" . This great love affair was to last until she passed away in 1985. 
 Albert returned to Hollywood in 1946. Some of his notable films from this period, include  Smash-Up: The Story of a Woman  (1947) with  Susan Hayward ; the comedy western  The Dude Goes West  (1948) which we wrote about  here ;  The Fuller Brush Girl  (1950) with  Lucille Ball ; and  Roman Holiday  (1953). He returned to Broadway in 1949 to star in the original production of  Miss Liberty. 
 Albert began acting in television in 1948 (not counting the experiment from a dozen years earlier). It is perhaps not well known that he starred in no less than THREE different tv shows prior to his best known one,  Green Acres.  The first was the sitcom  Leave it to Larry  (1952-53), in which he costarred with  Ed Begley.  Then in 1953, he had his own daytime talk and variety program  The Eddie Albert Show.  And in 1954, he hosted  The Saturday Night Revue  , a variety program that replaced  Sid Caesar's   Your Show of Shows.  He also starred in the 1956  Frank Capra  made-for-tv documentary  Our Mr. Sun.  Albert guest starred in numerous episodic tv dramas throughout the decade of the 1950s and the early '60s. 
 In 1955 he played the problematic part of Ali Hakim in the film version of  Oklahoma!  and was paired again with Susan Hayward in  I 'll Cry Tomorrow , the  Lillian Roth  biopic. Other films of the time included  Teahouse of the August Moon  (1956),  The Sun Also Rises  (1957), and the  Joe E. Lewis  biopic  The Joker is Wild  (1957). In the late '50s he did lots of tv, and was a replacement in the starring roles in the original Broadway productions of  The Seven Year Itch, The Music Man , and  Say Darling . Movies of the early '60s included  Who 's Got the Action?  and  The Longest Day,  both 1962. 
 In 1965 Eddie Albert was hired by  Paul Henning  to star in the second and final  Beverly Hillbillies   spinoff (following  Petticoat Junction ),  Green Acres . Adapted from the short-lived radio show  Granby 's Green Acres , the show was about a couple of rich city slickers (Albert and  Eva Gabor  as his wife) who move to a farm in the country. Albert's character is determined to make a go of it; his wife hates it. The show has become a sort of shorthand for any occasion when city people find themselves in rural areas, and feel inconvenienced by the experience. The theme song is one of the most memorable in sitcom history. (Footnote: a distant relative of mine,  Frank Cady , played storekeep Sam Drucker on the show). Also in the cast:  Pat Buttram  as the predatory salesman Mr. haney. The show was a smash hit; it remained on the air for six years, and in syndication ever after. 
 So this is what Albert has become best known for (in the saddest of cases, what he is  only  known for) but as we have seen, and as we  shall  see, he did much else, even while the show was still on. For example, in 1966, he was in **John Ford 's **last film  7 Women . He was nominated for an Oscar for his role in  Neil Simon's  The Heartbreak Kid  (1972), and narrated  Dr. Seuss's   The Lorax  that same year. He's in memorable episodes of  Columbo  and   McCloud , and has great turns in the films  McQ  (1974),  The Longest Yard  (1974), and  Escape to Witch Mountain  (1975). 
 Then he had another tv series! From 1975 through 1978 he co-starred with  Robert Wagner  in  Switch  , a series about a retired bunco cop (Albert) who teams with a reformed con artist (Wagner) in a private detective agency. The men get to have their cake and eat it too, by performing elaborate long-cons in order to catch crooks. This entertaining show was my introduction to Eddie Albert; I watched it in prime time long before I ever saw a rerun of  Green Acres. 
 A lot of guys would have retired after  Switch  went off the air, but Albert kept going in dozens of roles over nearly two more decades. He has smaller roles in movies like  How to Beat the High Co$t of Living   (1980),  Take This Job and Shove It  (1981), and  Dreamscape  (1984). In later years he was often cast a villain, and was surprisingly effective at it. He played such a role on  Falcon Crest  , and had earlier done so in movies like  McQ  and  The Longest Yard . Eddie Albert continued to act on film and tv right up until 1997, when he was over 90 years old. If you have been keeping score, he went to the top in no less than four media: radio, Broadway, film and tv, often at the same time!
