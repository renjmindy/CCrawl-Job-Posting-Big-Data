 The Korean Hogwan 
 Before embarking on a career as an ESL teacher in South Korea, you will have to make one decision: EPIK or Hogwan? 
 A Hogwan is the name of a private academy in South Korea. Thousands of Hogwans are located throughout the country and offer all types of learning! From piano lessons to English conversation classes, from soccer academies to conversational Japanese. They cater to all ages, even from as young as one years old. 
 Every year thousands of companies hire native English speakers to work in these education centers. Working hours can vary from job to job, but can start from as early as 6am and finish as late as 1am. (Recent laws have made this less likely). 
 It is important to note that every Hogwan is different and they should not be mistaken for a Korea public school ( EPIK ). 
 It is recommended to use a recruiter when applying for jobs at a Hogwan because at least if something goes wrong you have a second point of contact.  But be warned - you should never ever pay a recruiter for this service. 
 Below is a brief list of the benefits and negatives of a typical Hogwan: 
 Pros 
 Salary 
 Generally, Hogwans pay well. A starting salary normally varies between 2.1 and 2.3 million Korean Won, depending on qualifications and experience. 
 Free   Accommodation 
 The majority of Hogwans also provide free accommodation and free school meals, which cut your costs each month and allow you to save more of your money. 
 Severance Pay 
 The completion of a one year contract normally means the employer will give the employee severance pay, which is equal to a full month‚Äôs salary. 
 Flights 
 Almost every Hogwan will provide you with a free one-way flight to Korea. Many also offer a return ticket upon completion of the contract, but unfortunately, this is becoming less common over time. 
 Paid Vacation 
 By Korean law, Hogwans are obligated to provide their employees with 2 weeks paid vacation a year. Most allow one week off in July (summer vacation) and one in December (winter vacation). 
 Unfortunately, like with everything, there are also some negatives to working in Hagwon‚Ä¶ 
 Cons 
 Parents 
 The students‚Äô parents have too much involvement in most Hogwans. They can be very generous with gifts on special occasions, but equally as critical and moany every other day of the year. Ultimately they are paying a lot of money for their kids to attend school, so as annoying as it is, I can see why they hold so much power. 
 Closure 
 Many potential teachers fear that the school they are applying to will close down. This is not common, but unfortunately not a rare thing to happen either. Hogwans are ultimately businesses, so when they are not profitable or the owner has had enough, they can be closed down just as easily as your local corner shop. In most circumstances though, the Hogwans are bought out by investors who keep the current teachers employed. 
 Money First 
 As I just mentioned, Hogwans are businesses and money comes first. Sometimes the decisions by management and staff are not made in the best interest of the children or the teachers, but due to a financial means. 
 Before accepting a job at a Hogwan in Korea it is important to weigh both the pros and the cons. Do your research on that Hogwan and try to contact current teachers if possible!

 Teaching in Thailand vs. Teaching in Japan 
 Teaching in Thailand vs. Japan 
 by Rachael Hornsby 
 Having started my TEFL adventures in Thailand, I have now spent a year teaching there, and another 6 months teaching in Japan (with a year back in the UK in between). If you might be considering either of these countries to teach English in, or are deciding between East and South East Asia in general, here‚Äôs my brief take on how these countries have compared so far for me. Enjoy! 
 The dosh 
 It‚Äôs of course not all about the money, but, in terms of bare numbers, in Thailand my teaching wage was 30,000 baht per month (around ¬£ 700), whereas in Japan I earn 250,000 yen (~¬£2000). In both cases it is pretty much the standard amount for an inexperienced teacher. 
 My Thai wage obviously wasn‚Äôt a lot in UK terms, but the cost of living is so low in Thailand that it‚Äôs PLENTY to live on. My rent was about ¬£80 (although my friends‚Äô were cheaper!), and I could eat out every night for as little as 25 baht for a Pad Thai (about 50p!). Thailand and S.E. Asia as a whole is SO cheap that my Thai wage managed to take me on tonnes of adventures, such as tripping around Vietnam in my school holidays, and numerous weekends around Thailand, to Chiang Mai, Bangkok etc. 
 Living expenses obviously all cost so much more in Japan. My rent is 45,000 yen per month (over ¬£ 350), (although I know in big cities like Tokyo it can be MUCH higher), and bills and food add much more on to that. Again, I seem to have spent a lot of spare cash so far in Japan travelling, and unfortunately just exploring mainland Japan can be really pricey- a bullet train to Tokyo from my island of Kyushu is about ¬£170 (as opposed to a train I took to Laos from Southern Thailand for ¬£15!). 
 In short, the main difference is, if you are strict with your money, and don‚Äôt go off travelling every spare minute (it‚Äôs just so tempting!!), your savings in Japan will stretch much further if you take them elsewhere, especially to other economically rich countries, like if you wanted to pay off debts in the UK (with the pound plunging, at this rate you could go home with a small fortune!). My friends have also taken extra tutoring jobs on the side if they really wanted to fill up their wallet, although this might not be allowed in your contract. And if you‚Äôre really looking for the big bucks, jobs where the company actually pay for your flights or accommodation, like ones in South Korea, might be an even better bet. 
 ( WRITTEN OCTOBER 2016! The pound is changing so much these days, so god knows how long these currency conversions will be accurate. A couple of days!? ) 
 Culture 
 If you‚Äôre not hoping for a culture shock, then you‚Äôre in the wrong game! There are obviously hundreds of wonderful/fascinating/infuriating sides of Thai and Japanese culture, but here‚Äôs a few: 
 Although there are reasons not to get on the wrong side of Thailand (in a rare case some people I knew had a pretty rough time being deported‚Ä¶), the country generally really does live up to its reputation as the ‚Äúland of smiles‚Äù. From the random people I‚Äôd find to help me when my moped got a flat tire (more than once!), to the chatty monks on the train (let them talk to you first, don‚Äôt just go barging up to one!), it‚Äôs a great place for restoring faith in humanity. It‚Äôs also VERY laid back. The famously slow pace of pretty much anything there can drive many people absolutely up the wall- a train that should take 2 hours, ends up taking 5 hours, etc.-, but you will start to adopt the local ‚Äúmai pen rai‚Äù, care-free attitude, and pretty much all of my friends left Thailand a less uptight person than when they arrived (who couldn‚Äôt do with giving themselves that gift?). 
 Japan is in some ways the opposite of Thailand‚Äôs laid back attitude. From the notoriously prompt trains, to the meticulous dividing of household recycling, everything is fantastically organised and reliable. I‚Äôm constantly amazed at how efficient things are and by the different things Japan has come up with to get stuff done! As in Thailand, people in Japan are exceptionally polite and friendly, and the hospitality in Japan is second to none, to the extent that I admittedly found myself feeling a bit aggrieved without it in on a recent trip to Hong Kong, making me appreciate Japan even more. The level of politeness did at first it come off as a bit oppressive (train carriages are often silent, etc.), making it seem hard to ‚Äòbreak in‚Äô or really socialise, but of course with a little more patience you get to meet more people, and make amazing new friends. I think you could say Japan is more like the UK in that way!

 The job  __ 
 _ 
 
 _ 
___As far as the job goes, each school can differ widely depending on the age you‚Äôre teaching, whether it‚Äôs private or government, etc. etc., but there are a few general trends, which seem to be mainly extensions of Thailand‚Äôs ‚Äúmai pen rai‚Äù culture vs. the super efficient Japan. 
 Although I had textbooks for some of my classes at my Thai school, this wasn‚Äôt that common, and it tends to be a ‚Äúdo it yourself‚Äù kind of attitude to the curriculum/ teaching in general. This can obviously be a bit scary if it‚Äôs your first time teaching, and can be frustrating if you feel like you‚Äôre not getting the help or direction you‚Äôd like, but it‚Äôs also great as it gives you freedom in what you want to teach, allows you to experiment with your teaching style, and is a great challenge to get you tuck into the job. You also pretty much never know what‚Äôs going on- most weeks I‚Äôd turn up to work with all my lessons planned, only to find out at least 1 was cancelled for some random reason I didn‚Äôt know of, like the day we found ourselves ushered onto a school bus first thing, with kids all prepared wearing traditional outfits, and we spent the morning sitting in front of monks in a temple listening to them chant! 
 Japan, on the other hand, is a lot more organised in its approach. In my job teaching at a private kindergarten, I have tonnes more support, like a curriculum, weekly meetings, many of my lessons already planned for me etc. In comparison to Thailand, my job feels so much more coherent, although I‚Äôve heard that other jobs for the larger companies can be even more structured. In a way this means you can‚Äôt use as much creativity in your teaching, and aren‚Äôt being pushed quite as hard. And I do sometimes miss the manic spontaneity of Thailand (in my first month here, I was actually thrown into presenting an assembly without notice, and secretly loved it!). I also have to work evenings this time, like many other language schools, but I do have a lot more free time in the day that I don‚Äôt have to spend planning lessons, and generally feel a lot less ‚Äòat sea‚Äô.

___You obviously can‚Äôt spend all your time gallivanting around if you have a teaching job, but you can pack plenty of sightseeing into your free weekends and holidays if you fancy (and why ever not?!). In Thailand you‚Äôll find more elephants, street markets, and idyllic beaches, and it can be more of a wild party scene if you land a job near a tourist area (I‚Äôve had more ‚Äòbuckets‚Äô of cocktails than I‚Äôd care to remember‚Ä¶). Japan has more impressive mountains and hiking  (being made up of volcanic islands), there are hot spring baths and karaoke bars everywhere, and you can go skiing in winter (which I‚Äôm 99% sure you can‚Äôt do in Thailand!). It also has its share of good nightlife (especially in the big cities), and even has gorgeous beaches and great scuba diving spots down in balmy Okinawa. Basically, Japan and Thailand are both popular tourist destinations for good reason- they both have beautiful scenery, endless temples, fascinating festivals etc. etc. So, unless there‚Äôs something you‚Äôre absolutely itching to do, like climb Mount Fuji or rave at a full moon party, you‚Äôll find plenty of weird and wonderful ways to keep you occupied in both!

 Getting down and dirty 
 Thailand is by no means a third world country, but Japan is miles ahead of it when it comes to things like infrastructure and sanitation, and feels even more developed than the UK in some ways. Japan is probably the cleanest place I‚Äôve ever been, and they have technology for everything, from heated toilet seats to shoe vending machines (probably the name for it!) at the bowling alley. Thailand, on the other hand, can take a little getting used to for a Westerner. Rather than having heated toilets, we had to flush the loo using a bucket in our Thai school, and if you‚Äôre doing things on the cheap (which you might as well!), then you‚Äôll find yourself, for example, sitting on plastic chairs at a food stall in street, with stray dogs wandering around you whilst you eat your dinner. There are also more critters around in Thailand- I often found cute baby geckos living in my shoes, I was never without at least 1 mosquito bite (although I am especially attractive to the buggers!), and my town happened to be overrun with mafia-like monkeys. 
 The things in Thailand that seem so alien at first really don‚Äôt take long to feel normal, and to be honest I‚Äôm grateful for the experience of living with a tiny bit less luxury, for helping me appreciate how lucky we are at home, and showing me what I can actually live without. So if you want this type of challenge, I‚Äôd have to recommend Thailand, but if you want a more easy transition (dealing with a brand new Asian culture can be enough in itself!), then go for Japan. I myself am glad I did both in the order that I have, since I can appreciate the wonders of Japan even more!

 The language 
 Both Thai and Japanese are a world away from English, and I can‚Äôt profess to be much of an expert at either, but here goes. The Thai language has 1 ‚Äòalphabet‚Äô (or set of characters,) and uses lots of different tones. These can be seriously hard to pick up (‚Äúma‚Äù can have a whole host of meanings depending on your tone), but luckily Thais often understand what a farang (foreigner) is getting at without them. They often drop unnecessary words from sentences (as in Japan!), so I wasn‚Äôt too paranoid about having bad grammar either. The little Thai I learnt came in very handy and was really appreciated, especially in tourist spots (I was all but given applause just ordering pineapple in Krabi!). To be honest you can get by with very little Thai if you wish, and it‚Äôs surprising how many Thais speak some English anyway, even in remote parts of the country. 
 Japanese seems harder to me. This may just be because I‚Äôve put more effort into learning it, and so have realised what a mountain it is to really learn a language. Thailand‚Äôs ‚Äúalphabet‚Äù, once learnt, can get you reading any Thai for good (I‚Äôve been told!). Japan, however, has 3 sets of characters, and I can read the 2 basic ones (very handy for things like Western food menus), but the 3rd set of Chinese characters feels like it may take me an age to tackle (I‚Äôm sure Japanese people can‚Äôt even read them all!), and I still can‚Äôt read that much when I‚Äôm out and about. Unlike Thai, Japanese isn‚Äôt tonal, so once you‚Äôve learnt words or phrases, it‚Äôs pretty easy to catch them and pronounce them, but Japan also seem to have many more ways of saying one thing, depending on different situations or who you‚Äôre speaking to. This can make it more daunting when trying to use it yourself, or frustrating when you don‚Äôt understand something you thought you knew! Basic English also seems less widespread here, so there are certain things I‚Äôve simply had to drag a Japanese speaker along to help me do, like buying a phone contract, but you manage! 
 I‚Äôve been frustrated at times by my lack of skill at both languages, but really learning either can take years, and many TEFL teachers get by fine speaking very little, if any. It will of course enhance your experience whatever amount you manage to learn, so you might as well give it a bash, and if you really want to get the hang of it, just get yourself a local boy/girlfriend (seems to work every time!) 
 _Japanese vs. Thai (Jibberish vs. nonsense??)  _ 
 ‚ÄúKonichiwa, Japan!‚Äù or ‚ÄúSawadee Ka, Thailand!‚Äù?? 
 The beauty of a TEFL job is you get to spend months in a country that many people only spend a fortnight visiting on holiday, which teaches you so many beautiful/ ridiculous things about a place, and so there could be a billion more ways I could use to compare these two amazing countries (I could write a whole post on types of beer! Actually I might do that‚Ä¶). But in super brief, Thailand and Japan are like riding a Tuk Tuk vs. taking the bullet train. One is a bit more of a slow, bumpy ride, and the other is more sleek and a bit more predictable, but they are both brand new experiences, that can be equally thrilling (you‚Äôd be surprised how fast a Tuk tuk can go!), and will take you to places to never expected! Both countries are amazing, so if there‚Äôs anything at all drawing you to one or the other, just pick that one and GO! You won‚Äôt regret it.
