 Hauppauge, NY On The Job Injury Lawyer 
 If you have been injured at work, you need the help of a  Hauppauge, NY on the job injury lawyer  from Polsky, Shouldice & Rosen, P.C. While most employers try their best to create a safe environment for their workers, injuries still do occur in the workplace. Some of these injuries are very serious and require a certain amount of time off work. The idea of getting hurt at work isn’t pleasant to think about, but you can take steps to reduce your risk. A Hauppauge, NY on the job injury lawyer recommends some of these tips to avoid getting hurt at work. 
 Wear the Proper Safety Gear 
 If you have to work with machinery or hazardous materials at your job, it’s important to always wear your safety gear. For example, if you work in the construction industry, you should always wear a hard hat to protect your head from falling objects and slip-resistant boots to prevent slipping and falling. Even if your safety gear isn’t the most comfortable or fashionable to wear, you should never go without it. Having this gear on at all times can help you avoid life-threatening injuries. 
 Follow Instructions 
 The more carefully you follow instructions, the less likely you are to get hurt on the job. However, some workers become comfortable after they’ve been on the job for a while and don’t follow every instruction. Unfortunately, this can lead to mistakes and serious injuries. 
 Don’t Rush 
 An on the job injury lawyer in Hauppauge, New York knows that businesses want to be as efficient as possible and often give their employees deadlines to complete their work. This can force some employees to rush their work and get hurt. It is important to take your time with every task so that you can avoid this. If you aren’t being given ample time to complete your tasks, you should bring this up to your employer. 
 Get Plenty of Sleep 
 Getting adequate rest won’t just help you perform your job better. It can also help you avoid getting hurt. When you’re running on little sleep, you can’t concentrate as well and may end up making a mistake that causes injuries. To reduce your chances of getting injured on the job, try to get at least eight hours of sleep every night. 
 Report Unsafe Conditions to Your Employer 
 Whether it’s a broken machine or a spill on the floor, you should report hazardous conditions to your employer as soon as possible. They have a legal responsibility to repair unsafe conditions to ensure a safe environment for employees. 
 Don’t Hesitate to Ask for More Training 
 If you are having trouble understanding how to use a piece of equipment at your job, don’t be afraid to request additional training. It is better to ask for more training than risk getting hurt.
