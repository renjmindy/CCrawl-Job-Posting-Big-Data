 No Comments on Baking -- yeah, make-up baking 
 
 We can never get enough of upcoming makeup trends and techniques. Contouring, Strobing and now Baking. I am sure you came across makeup baking over the internet, so what is it? and how do you do it? 
 Baking makeup has been popular in the drag community for years and is even used by Kim Kardashian‚Äôs makeup artist (Mario) . To ‚Äúbake your makeup‚Äù means to let your concealer sit on your face for 10 to 20 minutes before blending it, so that your own body heat enables the makeup to melt into your skin and cause it to change color and texture. 
 Step one:  apply eye cream around the area to minimise caking. 
 Step two:  dab a thick, creamy concealer in a layer under the eyes and moving towards the temples, blending with a sponge. 
 Step three:  follow with a layer of another concealer, this time a brighter, lighter one, and pat in 
 Step four:  dust translucent powder over the concealed under-eye, to set. 
 Step five:  now that you‚Äôve pre-concealed, you can bake. Dampen a sponge, dip it into more powder and with a suitably heavy-hand, apply a layer under the eyes 
 Step six:  wait for your face bake for anywhere between 15 to 20 minutes. 
 Step seven:  With a clean fluffy brush, dust away any excess from your under-eyes. 
 OR, 
 You can just forget about all the powder and pre concealing and just apply primer, foundation just like you regularly do, go with your normal makeup routing. apply your under-eye concealer in a sideways triangular shape while staying in the cheekbone area. let your concealer sit for at least 10 to 20 minutes. Use the time to line your lips, style your hair, or fill in your brows. Then Blend üôÇ

 Black Lipstick was not something you expected to see on a run way, party or a casual outing. Ever since Black Lipstick hit the runway the recurring trend kept coming. The secret to owning Black Lipstick is the way you paint it on and the makeup on your face, it can turn out pretty Scary.  
 You need to outline outside your lipline, because black lipstick tend to make your lips appear smaller. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Avoid the blush, you can just  stroke on a little bit of blush but you don't want to over do it. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Avoid dark eye shadows. 
 Keep the face light and you'll see how your skin and face will go quite beautifully with the lipstick. 
 
 I f you think the Black Lipstick is way too dark, makeup artist Lucia Pieroni filled in the lips with M.A.C. Lip Pencil in Currant and topped it off with M.A.C. Lipmix in Burgundy to add a blackened-cherry color.
