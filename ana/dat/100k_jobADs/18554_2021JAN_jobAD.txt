 Celebrating in Advance: What's Right With Your Resume 
 Posted on  June 6, 2020  by  You Resume Support Blog 
   
 …can't wait to share my love of crafting resumes with you (my 1st live training) 
 Hi, I’m Debra Ann. I spend most of my time learning. Some of my favorite days were spent on the hill at UT, that's the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, (that is for my Texas supporters) siting in English Literature classes, dissecting and divulging the meanings of words, concepts; justifying my own interpretation of famous and not-so-famous literary artists including… Oh I can't remember those old folks names now, but I loved learning about Malcolm X, Paula Giddens, Alex Hailey, and of course Nikki Giovonni and other local Tennessee writers and artists. I later learned the value of all of those speech, communications, rhetoric classes is just what I am able to do right now= Read, Research, and Write Resumes. I absolutely love taking my clients experiences and showing them how I can help them target them in a way that hiring managers and recruiters can see their value.
