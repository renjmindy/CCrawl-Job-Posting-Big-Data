 Logo Generator / Maker - Website with E-Commerce 
 Published: 4 days ago  Deadline: 19 Bids: 4 
 I need to develop a website with a logo generator where the client can generate the options by providing little information and making compositions using our image bank. At the end of the process, you can download the logo in different formats such as svg, pdf, and png after making the payment via credit card or bank transfer. The contracted professional must deliver the website hosted and functioning in the domain that I will provide. 
 The website should give me the opportunity to change the layout myself and fill the database with new images. I am a graphic designer and I will take care of that part. I just don't know much about programming.
