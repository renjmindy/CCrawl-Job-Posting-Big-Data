 Take a look at a few industries below that experts believe are recession proof. If you are unemployed because of a business closure or restructure, you might want to consider a new career in one of these 6 different areas. 
 Recession Proof Jobs & Industries 
 *** Education.** The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has historically shown  teaching  to be relatively recession-proof. But demographics are important: High-growth areas like the Sun Belt offer much better prospects than the Rust Belt. 
 *** Energy.** "This is a major issue for the global economy, and jobs related to oil and gas,  alternative energy  and even nuclear are likely to see strong growth," Challenger said. 
 *** Health care.** Almost half the 30 fastest growing occupations are concentrated in  health services  -- including medical assistants, physical therapists, physician assistants,  home health aides , and medical records and health information technicians -- according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 *** International business.** "If you have a strong knowledge of other cultures, and an ability to work in another country, you'll find plenty of opportunities," according to John Challenger. "If you're first generation Chinese, with business skills and Chinese language skills, you're in good shape. 
 
 Environmental sector.  There is a huge and growing industry geared to combat global warming. "Not only will professionals with skills in sustainability issues be in demand through the end of the decade, we are likely to shortages of professionals with 'green' skills," said Rona Fried, president of sustainablebusiness.com, a networking service for sustainable businesses. 
 
 *** Security.** "Crime doesn't stop during a recession, and  police officers , port security specialists and international security experts will continue to be in demand," Challenger emphasized.
