 Some great examples of Visual Resume's. Good inspiration. I think it's important to mention that a VR should not eliminate a traditional resume (not just yet), make it a teaser, an insight into your character. Make the prospective employer want to talk to you. I've had great responses on mine!

 These are great examples of how you can make a resume stand out from the 100 other applicants that want the same job as you. We have created an interactive resume, inspired by the facebook timeline. It is all done in Powerpoint and uses only standard shapes and objects. With clever animations and special features such as youtube video integration, this resume can impress your future employee. Take a look at our youtube demo video:
