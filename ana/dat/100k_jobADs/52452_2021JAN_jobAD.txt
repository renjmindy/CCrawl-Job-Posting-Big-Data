 What is a job board? 
 What is a job board? A job board is a website used by employers to advertise their job vacancies to job seekers. Job seekers can use job boards to search for new job opportunities in their area and profession. Some well-known job board sites are  Indeed ,  Glassdoor , and  Careerjet  to name a few. 
 
 Usually, online job boards allow recruiters to use some features without charge, offering options for free job postings or trials. Job boards also offer premium schemes, such as sponsored jobs or unlimited access to their candidate database. Some job boards, for example,  Monster  and  Careerbuilder , can be used by employers in all industries, while others are niche, for industries like tech (e.g.  Dice ), design (e.g.  Behance ), and other types of roles. 
 Job boards are most often free for job seekers. 
 Now that we've covered what a job board is, see our comprehensive list of  **  the top job boards ** . 
 The benefits of using job boards 
 Job boards are  valuable tools  for recruiters and hiring managers aiming to attract and find new talent. Here’s why: 
 Job boards are well-known job advertising tools 
 Job seekers have been using job boards for years, so these sites give employers access to millions of good candidates. Most of the job boards are candidate-focused and user-friendly, allowing applicants to complete the process quickly, using simple tabs and buttons. 
 Nowadays, many job boards are integrated with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), such as Workable, which have improved candidate experience by making the application process more fluid and efficient. 
 Want to know how you can easily post to multiple online job boards and organize incoming applications?  **  Get a demo here. ** 
 Job boards provide resume databases 
 Candidates can sign up at job boards and upload their resumes. This way, recruiters can actively search for potential employees, setting the right  Boolean commands  or criteria and contacting high-potential professionals. This is a benefit because some great candidates aren’t currently looking for a job so they won’t see your job ad; but with the resume database, you can proactively reach out to a good candidate. 
 Job boards help with employer branding 
 Many job boards, such as Glassdoor and  LinkedIn , allow employers to craft their own company page in the website. Companies can showcase their vision and culture, and, with the right storytelling, attract candidates who would be good culture fits.
