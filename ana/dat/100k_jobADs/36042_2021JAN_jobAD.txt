 SPCK/SSG: My Story, by Phil Groom

 Jobs 
 A question asked  at the  meeting held on Sept 10th 2008  was, "How can we help the ex-SPCK/SSG booksellers who are now unemployed?" One answer suggested is this page: an opportunity for job seekers to post their details; and somewhere for prospective employers to advertise vacancies. 
 The deal is simple: free listings for job seekers; for advertising situations vacant, we request a donation to the  Save the SPCK Booksellers Fund : £10 for 1 month; £25 for 3 months. Donations are best made online but if you would prefer to contribute by cheque, please make your cheque payable to "UK Christian Bookshops Directory" and send it with a covering note to Phil Groom — postal address  available on request  |  Why advertise here? 
 In either case, please either leave the relevant details as a comment on this page or use the  Contact page  to send in details privately. Please remember that this is a public noticeboard: please think carefully about what information you leave via the comments…
