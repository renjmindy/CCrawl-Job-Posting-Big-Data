 Empties - May 2019 
 June 3, 2019 Mrs Strawberry Blonde   Empties   16 Comments 
 Hi there! It's already the 3rd of June, so it's time for my May Empties post. As always, I used a number of single use face masks. I didn't keep the empty sachets, but if you're interested, you can  click here  to read about my latest face mask finds. Without further ado, onto the big bottles, tubes and tubs! ðŸ˜Ž 
 
1  Nourish Balance Refining Toning Mist  - I didn't love this face mist, and I won't be buying it again. 
 2  Palmolive Aroma Moments Just Fabulous  - this is a lovely shower gel that I will buy again, no doubt! My husband used this shower gel too, so this is a  shared  empty. 
 3  Treacle Moon The Honeycomb Secret  - another amazing shower gel from Treacle Moon. Another shower gel that I will repurchase. 
 
4  Boots Botanics Skin Brightening Deep Clean Gel  - this is one of my all-time favourite face washes. Unfortunately, it's been discontinued ages ago, and this was the last tube I had. ðŸ˜ª 
 5  Beautifully Scrumptious Almond Body Butter  - this is a nice body butter that I might pick up again. 
 
6  Aussie Mega Conditioner  - this is one of the best conditioners I've ever used. It's not as good as the  original Herbal Essences  conditioners, but nothing comes close to those really. In any event, I will repurchase this conditioner (and the matching shampoo) for sure! 
 7  Original Source Passionfruit and Jojoba Milk Shower Milk  - this is a nice shower gel that I might buy again. 
 8  Pantene Pro-V Youth Protect Rejuvenating Intensive Conditioner  - one of Pantene's best hair products! I would buy this deep conditioner again! 
 
9  Superdrug Cranberry & Pomegranate Body Butter  - this body butter was much older than I'd care to admit. It smelled and looked perfect, but I didn't want to use it on my body - so I decided to use it on my feet instead. It did a great job! This body butter has been discontinued ages ago, and repurchasing it would be impossible! 
 10  Nivea Age Defying Q10 Hand Cream  - a great hand cream! I have a few more of these in my stash! 
 
11  Maybelline Eyeliner Chestnut  (x2) - these are nice eyeliners. Now that I've finished these 2, I think I just have 2 or 3 more in my stash. 
 12  Superdrug Naturally Radiant Glycolic Acid Daily Cleansing Pads  - I'll be reviewing these very shortly! ðŸ˜Š 
 13  Sally Hansen Hard As Nails Xtreme Wear Buff  - a simple and unspectacular nothing colour. I used this one as a base coat. I wouldn't buy this polish again. 
 I'm happy with what I finished in May! Which products have you said goodbye to recently? Feel free to get in touch via the comments. And thanks for reading! ðŸ˜˜

 100% Vegan - Original Source Passionfruit And Jojoba Milk Shower Milk, Original Source Orange Shower Gel 
 April 10, 2019 Mrs Strawberry Blonde   Bath & Shower ,  Original Source   5 Comments 
 Hi there! Today's post is about 2 shower gels which I picked up at a local independent bargain store -  Original Source Passionfruit & Jojoba Milk Shower Milk  and  Original Source Orange Shower Gel . These shower gels are imports from Germany. 
 Original Source Passionfruit & Jojoba Milk Shower Milk  smells like the perfect fusion of juicy and tangy passionfruit and creamy jojoba. It's very enjoyable. This shower milk is also gentle on the skin. I like it! 
 
 Original Source Orange Shower Gel  is very nice. It smells like juicy oranges. This shower gel is refreshing, and I think it's perfect for early mornings because it really wakes me up! Well done, Original Source! 
 Original Source Passionfruit & Jojoba Milk Shower Milk  and  Original Source Orange Shower Gel  are available as  250ml . I paid  90p  each.
