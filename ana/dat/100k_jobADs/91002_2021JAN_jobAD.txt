 COVID-19 UPDATE 
 World Class Academy continues to closely monitor the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. As students, staff, families, teachers, classrooms, and communities around the world continue to be affected, we stand by our commitment to provide engaging learning opportunities while mitigating the risks that are inherent with global travel. 
 We remain optimistic that this situation will continue to improve. We are moving forward with preparing to resume all programs as planned for the 2020-2021 school year. We are still accepting master applications and encourage interested students to apply. Due to the uncertainty surrounding global health and safety, we have updated our tuition refund policy to allow for tuition refunds until August 30 if the school moves to distance learning or is forced to cancel a term due to the coronavirus. Prospective students and families are encouraged to reach out with any questions about the upcoming school year.
