 Other resources for finding science communication jobs - March 2019 
 Posted on  March 8, 2019  by  Jo Brodie 
 This is a copy of an email sent to the  psci-com mailing list  for people interested in science communication and public engagement with science. It lists some ways of finding out about jobs in scicomm. 
 1. List of London-heavy 'places where science communicators might work' 
2. More global versions 
3. Different types of science communication jobs 
4. Other mailing lists and jobs boards 
5. Gov.UK resource 
6. Misc 
 Some general good advice from Amanda Freise at BiteSizBio on  Getting started with a job in science communication  - 
 "It can also be tricky to actually find job openings, as positions often have vague or obscure names; for example, I once saw a job advert that was seeking a person to develop a science outreach program that was simply titled ‚ÄúProject Manager‚Äù. So you may need to put in time to carefully sift through job descriptions." 
 1. List of London-heavy 'places where science communicators might work' 
As you may know I enjoy collecting vacancies pages of any organisation that might employ science communicators and am in the process of updating my  ancient 2009 post which lists many in London . I also gave a  'how to' talk about science communcation jobs  a couple of years ago at BIG. 
 2. More global versions 
A while ago I copied info from the above list into a  Google spreadsheet  and asked people to add to it, it's editable. There's a fantastic  Facebook  group for science communication jobs  (you need to join to see it). I hear from others that  LinkedIn  can be very good, with recruiters coming to you to apply for things. It has a page tagged with  science communication jobs  but not all of them are in the strictest sense. 
 3. Different types of science communication jobs 
Partly inspired by  Prospect .ac.uk's pages on " What (jobs) can I do with a [science] degree? " which didn't really mention that much scicomm beyond  science writing  I thought I'd have a go at a version of  What jobs do science communicators do? . The sector is so huge I think it's impossible to do it justice! 
 4. Other mailing lists and jobs boards 
 ABSW  (Association of British Science Writers),  BIG  Stem Communicators Network  jobs board ,  Stempra  ‚Äì Science, Tech, Engineering, Maths / Medicine PR Association,  NCCPE  's Public Engagement Network  ( mailing list ),  Indeed .co.uk also has a page tagged with  Science Communication Jobs ,  PCST  (Public Communication of Science and Technology) network. Also  @ScicommJobs  and  blog . 
 5. Gov.UK resource 
The GOV.UK website has a list of  all of its departments, agencies and public bodies , of course some are quite sciencey! 
 In the gov.uk page each listing is linked to its own website but I think most of the jobs are also advertised centrally via the  Civil Service Jobs  page. You can search by location and salary, restrict the search to individual or multiple organisations and also, if you know the job ref, by job reference. 
 A couple of jobs that might interest the list - 
 Care Quality Commission 
 Senior Media Officer 
Closing date: 17 Mar 2019 
Job ref: 1623793, ¬£42,121, LONDON

Job ref: 1620000, ¬£35k (FAREHAM or NEWPORT, GWENT) or ¬£36k (LONDON) 
 6. Misc
