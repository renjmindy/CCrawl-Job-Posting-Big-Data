 Awesome interview Jomar, great questions! I have always wanted answers to some of the questions you asked like "…how did music find you?" Nobody I know phrases that question in that manner usually it's "How did you get started?" Such subtle differences make a great interview…glad I found this one. Well done.

 * Thanks for your kind words Jerry, I could have spent another couple of hours talking with Ken. I'll publish the second part of the interview next month, where he talks a bit more about Rumours and his work with his daughter Colbie.  
 
 Thanks again Jerry,
