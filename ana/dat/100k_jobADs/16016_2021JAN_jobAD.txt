 Interview 
 Success in job interviews 
 "Just introduce yourself and tell us a little about yourself."  These words often precede an interview, and even if every candidate is mentally prepared, in practice, many still fail to do well. 
 Presenting yourself convincingly  is often a very hard task, even for many who are otherwise talented specialists in their profession. Speaking openly  about yourself can be difficult . In addition, it can often be difficult to judge what constitutes a  healthy self-assessment . And here, it quickly becomes clear which candidates have the mindset the advertised profile demands. Do they offer honest and authentic insights? How  self-critical and future-oriented  is each applicant? The  presentation  also shows how well any candidate has prepared for the job interview. Do they tell a coherent story? 
 To be authentic and self-reflective in a job interview is key 
 It is also important to address your  own strengths and weaknesses . Talk about these with your family and friends or former colleagues. This will enable you to clarify  what others regard as your best qualities  and what your weaknesses are. It’s always very important to  be authentic . An HR-consultant will quickly notice whether you are building a façade, or whether you can speak about your own personal qualities, and also identify weaknesses in a self-reflective manner. To avoid clichés and identify with the  most important attributes  required for the position advertised is essential.
