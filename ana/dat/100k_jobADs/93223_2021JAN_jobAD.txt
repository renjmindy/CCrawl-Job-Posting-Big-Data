 QUALIFICATIONS FOR MECHANICS: 
 In Australia, the most common pathway to becoming a mechanic is through an apprenticeship. Apprentices complete four years of on and off-the-job training. This involves hands-on experience in a workshop combined with formal classroom instruction. 
 Pre-apprenticeship studies are available for high school students who wish to increase their chances of gaining an apprenticeship. Students learn about the care and maintenance of vehicles, and the basics of engine construction. Pre-apprenticeship training may be credited towards later qualifications, shortening the length of an apprenticeship. 
 After completing their apprenticeship, mechanics often undertake specialised certificate courses in areas such car repairs, diesel engines or aircraft maintenance. 
 Suitable courses for those seeking to become mechanics or update qualifications include: 
 
 
 Certificate IV in Automotive Management 
 
 
 Certificate IV in Automotive Electrical Technology 
 
 
 Certificate IV in Automotive Mechanical Diagnosis 
 
 
 Certificate III in Motorcycle Mechanical Technology 
 
 
 Certificate III in Light Vehicle Mechanical Technology
