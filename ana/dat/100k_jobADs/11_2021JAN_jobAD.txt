 Workable has a Google Analytics integration available as part of the Advanced Careers Page. Activity throughout your careers page will be tracked in Google Analytics. You'll be able to see information on the number of visitors, time spent, their source and more. 
 Add your Google Analytics tracking ID under the  Careers Page  settings  in Workable. 
 To find your tracking ID in Google Analytics: 
 
 Sign in to Google Analytics and click Admin 
 Select an account and a property in the relevant columns 
 Under Property, click Tracking Info, then Tracking Code and the tracking ID will be displayed at the top 
 
 If you don't have an advanced careers page or Google Analytics, check out the    Reports  section of your Workable account. The  Candidate Sources report , for example, automatically tracks where candidates apply from.
