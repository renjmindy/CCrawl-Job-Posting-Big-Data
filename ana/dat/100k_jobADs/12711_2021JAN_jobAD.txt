  5 Reasons Having A Baby Won’t Ruin Your Career  
 Sarah Daren 
 June 19, 2015 
 Women have more career options than ever before and advancement in the workplace is guaranteed for those who work hard and are dedicated to their companies. Many women now are getting married later in life compared to a few decades ago in order to have established a promising career.

Who is to say that a woman can't have a great career and a baby, too? It is most definitely possible to have it all in today's world. Here are top five reasons that having a baby won't ruin your career: 
 
 1. Maternity Leave Options 
 One of the most important parts of maintaining a career at the same time as having a baby is knowing your company's maternity leave policies. If you have been with a company for a while then you not only may have time off built up, but you will have access to maternity leave and pay while you are out delivering and spending time with your baby. It is essential to plan; this will allow you to save as much time as necessary depending on how long you want to stay away from the office. You will then be able to tack your time-off to your maternity leave and be out for the desired amount of time. If you happen to have a difficult pregnancy, don't be too concerned because you can qualify for disability as well in order to still bring in money while on pregnancy leave. 
 2. Child Care Options 
 Once you have figured out the maternity leave options it's important to consider childcare. You should be planning ahead of time and scope out places and people before you have your baby. Family members and close friends are of course the first choice when it comes to childcare options. However, if you need to search out other options then there are plenty of institutions that offer daycare as well as in-home options. You can opt for an in home childcare worker in their own home or even hire a nanny to take care of your child in your home. The possibilities are truly endless when it comes to finding care for your baby enabling you to go back to work. 
 3. Work From Home Options 
 Another great option available has allowed many mothers to stay in their career yet take care of their children as well. Now, companies offer telecommuting positions. Technology has allowed it so that work can be done anywhere. This is definitely an avenue to consider when deciding on having a baby and maintain your career. Speak with your IT department as well as your boss to figure out the ins and outs of working from home and ensure it's the best option for you and your career. 
 4. Breast Pumps 
 Breast pumps are by far the best advancement allowing women to go back to work after having a baby. For those mothers who want to breastfeed, the breast pump allows them to still keep their milk flow. The breast pump also allows mothers to bottle their breast milk in order to let another individual take care of the baby. It's important to research the best breast pump for your needs. If you are considering going back to work soon and solely feeding with breast milk then you will want to invest in a high powered electric breast pump. 
 5. Work Site Daycare 
 Another popular trend among top companies is having on-site daycare available. This is an amazing accommodation made for families. It allows parents to work while still having their children nearby. This is a great option for those mothers who are breastfeeding. Having work site daycare available is not only beneficial for parents, but for companies as well. Parents will spend less time worrying about their children at an offsite daycare. Another great perk is that the work site daycare is open all days that the company is, meaning that parents will only have to take time off to stay with their kids if they are sick and not because of an obscure daycare holiday. The technologies around today have truly allowed women to have it all. Any woman who wants to advance in her career should not worry that a baby may ruin it. There are plenty of options out there for women in the workforce who are ready to have a baby. So, go ahead girl, you can have your baby shower cake and eat it, too.
