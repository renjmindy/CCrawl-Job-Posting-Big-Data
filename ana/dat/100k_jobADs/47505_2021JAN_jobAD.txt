 Reasons your resume isn't getting noticed 
 BY: Tracey Mesken03/04/2017 
 ​You submit your resume and wait. And wait. And wait. Why isn’t anyone calling?A resume is an important tool in your job search. It is the key to helping you get hired for a position.Your resume is a chance to make a great first impression. It can be tough to stand out in today’s competitive job market. Follow these tips to create a resume that gets the phone ringing and helps you land the job you want.1. Open with a punchThe first section of your resume should pack the strongest punch. Your resume needs to be more than just a list of jobs. Start with a summary of your most important skills that are relevant to the jobs you are chasing. Think about what the employer would be looking for and then tailor your existing skills and qualifications accordingly. Include things like:• Your degree/s and any specialisations• Licenses’, tickets & certifications like your CPR• Medicals & Inductions• Years of experience• Important skills & industry knowledge2. Your Work HistoryYour work history is where you have a chance to prove your skill level. You might find it difficult to identify your achievements because you feel you were just doing your job. Have a think about the responsibilities and achievements you take for granted and include these in your resume. Ask yourself questions like:• Did you win any awards of receive incentives for work performance?• Did you train new employees?• Did your work enable a project to be completed on time and/or on budget?• Did you complete any special training?• Did you submit all your reports on time?• Did you implement or recommend processes that improved productivity or efficiency?3. TrainingA stand out resume needs to include hands on education and training. Use this section to list courses attended, vocational training, further education, certification, licenses completed, signed skills matrix & equipment competencies.4. Include KeywordsEver wondered how prospective employers or recruiters find your resume on platforms like SEEK or in their own databases? They search for candidates using keywords. Using keywords such as "registered nurse"or "nurse case manager" in your resume, for example, will help an employer or recruiter find your resume in their database or on a job board - as long as they're searching for candidates who are either a registered nurse or nurse case manager. This is keyword matching. Always think about what your next employer is searching for when writing your resume.5. Proof ReadSpelling and grammatical errors are very common in resumes. Avoiding these mistakes can make all the difference in your resume being put forward to possible employers. Make sure you show your resume to a few people to double check it is error free. You need to think of your resume as an advertisement of your services, that extra attention to detail will make all the difference.Don’t be disheartened and don’t give up! There are so many roles out there and so many people applying that you are not likely to find the perfect job on your first go.So use the tips above, create that stand-out resume and make sure you set time aside each day to sit down and search for new positions and apply, apply, apply!
