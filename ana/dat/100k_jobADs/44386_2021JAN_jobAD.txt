 My client, a privately-owned manufacturing group with multiple sites in the UK, are currently looking for a Test and Development Engineer to help them with the advancement of engineering practices and processes, based in their Worcestershire HQ. 
 This is a steadily developing business who are currently advancing the way they design and engineer products for distribution across the UK and Europe in order to bring more innovation and all-new products to the market. The successful Test and Development Engineer will advance their career within a great working environment and be given the opportunity to work with full autonomy in what is a standalone role where utilising strong communication skills to work cross functionally with other departments such as sales, maintenance, quality, production and design will be key. 
 You'll join a profitable business with a clear growth strategy and an energised leadership team who are driving the business forward at pace. Innovation in Product Development is critical to the future strategy, so you will be able to play a high-profile part in the development of the business. 
 In situations where any units are identified as faulty and within warranty period, you will need to perform the testing of those electronically controlled products in order to fault find and understand opportunities for continuous improvement. 
 At times you will be required to support Sales and Maintenance Engineering teams in situations where unusual or challenging issues are identified out in the field so this aspect of the role will involve travelling to customer sites using a vehicle provided by the company. 
 Working hours are 9am - 5pm with 1 hour for lunch and as well as free on-site parking, the business also offers a good benefits package to accompany a basic salary of between £35,000 - £40,000. 
 Please apply or call Elliot Fenton for more information on 0121 752 9910.
