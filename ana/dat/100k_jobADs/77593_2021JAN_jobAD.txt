 Korean Business Leaders Visit Wheaton Job Center 
 _“ …it was also interesting and extremely educational to learn about how workforce development is done in Korea, some 7,000 miles away!” 
_ Emerald Fuller,  Job Center Director 
 On October 4, we hosted a delegation from our counterparts in Korea, the Korea Employment Information Service’s Employment Service Competency Team, at our Job Center in Wheaton. The group was in town to meet with the Department of Labor and wanted to see an example of a successful American job center. 
 Interim Regional Labor Exchange Administrator for Montgomery/Prince George’s Counties, Barbara Ebel, along with our own Emerald Fuller, director of the Adult and Dislocated Worker Program, and Aldith Campbell, program director of the Young Adult Opportunity Program, provided a tour of the Wheaton Job Center and talked about how we provide employment services to the Montgomery County community. The Korean delegation was particularly interested in how we train our staff. They, in turn, shared information on how they provide career guidance, including assessments, such as aptitude tests for entrepreneurs and IT careers. 
 “We were naturally proud to show off our facility and talk about our best practices,” said Emerald Fuller, Job Center Director. 
 “However, it was also interesting and extremely educational to learn about how workforce development is done in Korea, some 7,000 miles away!”
