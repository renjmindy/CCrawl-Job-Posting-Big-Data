 Democrat Whack Jobs 
 September 5, 2012: Mark Alan Siegel, Palm Beach County Democrat Chairman [1:02] 
 
 He says Christians are "false friends" who just want Jews to die. He apparently hasn't paid a lot of attention to his own party's support for people who loudly, publicly and at great length spew their single-minded determination to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth. 
 
 Sep 4, 2012: Debbie Wasserman Schultz Caught Lying on Live TV [1:13] 
 
 At a convention training session for Jewish Democrats aimed at teaching them how to convince their fellow Jews to vote for Obama, DNC chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz (who is Jewish) said, “We know, and I’ve heard no less than Ambassador Michael Oren say this, that what the Republicans are doing is dangerous for Israel." 
 When this was reported by the Washington Examiner, Ambassador Oren released a statement saying, “I categorically deny that I ever characterized Republican policies as harmful to Israel. Bipartisan support is a paramount national interest for Israel, and we have great friends on both sides of the aisle." 
 When a reporter challenged DWS about this, live on national TV, DWS said she had been deliberately misquoted by that bad conservative newspaper. Unfortunately for her, the reporter had her remarks on tape, which he played. OOPS.

   Verse of the day 
 
 Galatians 6:7-8 
 
 
 
 “Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.”
