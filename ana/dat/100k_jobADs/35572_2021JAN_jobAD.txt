 Silent Boris and Silent Bela: The Early Careers of Two Horror Icons 
 Posted on  October 25, 2015  by   Lea S. 
 Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi are not only two of the most iconic faces of movie horror, but two of the most iconic figures in Hollywood history, period. The "looks" of Frankenstein's monster and Count Dracula are synonymous with those early Thirties screen interpretations, to the point where only literature buffs remember that Bram Stoker's Dracula was a disturbing elderly man with a mustache and that Mary Shelley's Monster spoke philosophically about its own existence. 
 There are only these men. 
 We tend know Karloff and Lugosi exclusively for their work in horror, especially since both men ended up having lengthy, if very typecast, movie careers. But did you know that good chunks of those careers were during the silent era? 
 Let's take a look at what Boris and Bela were up to before the talkie era arrived: 
 Silent Boris 
 A future Monster at a more youthful age. 
 If you had gotten to meet Boris as a young man, he would've introduced himself with his original name: William Henry Pratt. Yes, the one-day icon of horror used to be known as Billy Pratt. 
 The Anglo-Indian Billy was born in London, and was the youngest of nine children. While the rest of his siblings would forge distinguished careers in areas of diplomacy and other civil services, Billy sheepishly professed a love of acting. It's thought that he chose his stage name, Boris Karloff, partly to conceal the disgrace of a Pratt becoming a lowly actor. (Despite his anxiety, his siblings were said to be proud of their brother's later success.) Although he had no Russian ancestry, "Boris Karloff" suggested a connection with the Russian Ã©migrÃ©-a big topic at the time. 
 Boris started appearing on stage in 1909, spending about ten years performing with shows that traveled throughout Canada and the U.S.. Manual labor jobs provided extra income, as they would during his early forays into film, starting as an extra in the Pearl White drama  The Lightening Raider  (1919).

 Karloff had a number of bit parts and supporting roles in the early '20s, his niches being serials and adventure stories with exotic settings (and by the way, it's not true that he was an extra in  The General  ). The titles of these films were along the lines of  The Masked Rider, Vultures of the Sea, The White Panther,  and  Perils of the Wild.  And funnily enough, despite his name-changing attempt to seem Russian he would often be cast in roles such as "Maharajah Jehan" and "Priest of Kama-Sita." 
 
 As "The Nabob" in  The Infidel  (1922),  Exhibitor 's Trade Review . 
 By the mid-'20s, although exclusively a supporting actor and bit player, Karloff was gradually becoming a familiar Hollywood figure. One letter to a 1925  Picture-Play Magazine  mentioned: "â€¦Boris Karloff, the greatest natural actor on the screen to-day, is becoming popular. He has always been my favorite actor ever since I first saw him in 'The Hope Diamond Mystery' serial." However, it would take until the talkie era for Karloff to get his "big break"-with, yes, his role in  Frankenstein  (1931). 
 Silent Bela 
 Bela strikes a pose in 1920. 
 BÃ©la Ferenc DezsÅ‘ BlaskÃ³ was born in Lugos, Kingdom of Hungary, an area that is now part of Romania (so you could say that he's practically a native of Transylvania). A few years after dropping out of school at age 12, Lugosi began acting on the stage. He adopted the name "Bela Lugosi" in 1903, probably in honor of his hometown. Over the years he became skilled enough to be in Shakespeare productions, and performed with the National Theatre of Hungary during the 1910s-although as a supporting actor, not a leading man as he would later claim. 
 Lugosi's theater career would be interrupted by his service during WWI, where he was wounded three times and awarded the Wound Medal. Following this he began supplementing his stage work with supporting roles in films, his first being a small part in  Az ezredes  (1917). His film name was "Arisztid Olt." Lugosi-or rather, Olt-made 12 Hungarian films before the Hungarian Revolution of 1919, when he was forced to flee to Germany (apparently due to activism in an actors' union). There he continued with small film roles, some of which were in acclaimed works such as F.W. Murnau's  Der Januskopf  __ (1920), starring Conrad Veidt.

 In October 1920 Lugosi was on the move again, heading west to the United States. He quickly worked his way up to Broadway, appearing in the hit play  The Red Poppy  in 1922. This won him the attention of the "movie folk" and he was offered his first U.S. film role: as a sinister Eastern European leader of a terrorist gang in  The Silent Command  (1923). Yes, the typecasting that would follow him the rest of his career started almost the second he entered Hollywood. 
 
 Lugosi around the time of his turn in  The Red Poppy  (  Shadowland  , 1923). 
 It's an amusing coincidence that a _Exhibitor 's Herald _review of  The Silent Command  would describe it as a story of "plotters, vampires and 'secret orders'"-"vampires" in this case meaning the 1920s  femme fatales  , of course. 
 Lugosi continued to play assorted "heavies" (usually with vaguely foreign backgrounds) in Hollywood features throughout the rest of the Twenties. But his most important role, the one that would forever influence his destiny, was in  Dracula  â€¦the 1927 stage version. His version of the Count was unlike anything that had been seen before: suave, alluring, but still very frightening. And we all know who would then be chosen to star in Tod Browning's 1931 classic. 
 After Silents 
 Both Karloff and Lugosi had surprisingly similar careers. Both had grown up in Europe, both had been active on the stage, and both spent years in small film roles before finally getting their big breaks in the early talkie period. And both big breaks happened to be the roles they would be identified with forevermore. Their horror movie statuses became so ingrained so quickly that they would even be teamed up in several films together, such as  The Raven  (1935),  The Invisible Ray  (1936), and  The Body Snatcher  (1945). While not close friends, the two enjoyed their work together. 
 Both ended up being typecasted as well, eventually ending their long careers with strings of B-movies where they inevitably appeared in their familiar monster makeup. Karloff didn't mind, as he felt that horror films were a modern-day version of Grimm's fairytales, but Lugosi once lamented: "I don't know if I should call it a fortune or a curse, but Dracula never ends." 
 Time seems to have been kind to both of them. The cheesiness that's always haunted their most famous characters still exists-as it probably always will be-in the form of Halloween costumes and unending cheapie horror films. But as I've mentioned repeatedly, both Karloff and Lugosi have ascended to the status of icons today. When you sit down and watch  Frankenstein  or  Dracula  today all the memories of cheesiness and B-movies fade away, and only those mesmerizing performances remain.

 Well, gee, I just learned about 53 things I didn't know before!!!! 
 Ironically enough, once Boris hit it big in the talkiesâ€¦.it was with a role in which he didn't have any dialogue to say!!!! Life is funny! 
 I actually remember being a kid and seeing "Arsenic and Old Lace" and being so excited that I was going to get to hear Karloff talk! (Incidentally, that is a day I will never forget: at 11:00 in the morning I saw "The Canterville Ghost" with Charles Laughton, then "Arsenic and Old Lace" came onâ€¦.and then "The Conversation"â€¦.no silents, unfortunatelyâ€¦..but a day of three good movies, all in a row! (my mother had insisted I watch all three!!! Thanks, Ma!!) 
 LOVE the picture of Bela in the Murnau film!! I want to see that, now! Lugosi and Veidt, with a Murnau!

 All those years and silents, and his big talkie role has no dialogue-that's true! ðŸ˜€ 
 Arsenic and Old Lace, that's one of my favorite "talkies." It's essential Halloween viewing (my list of essentials gets longer every year, I swear!). 
 Isn't that a great picture of Bela? The blog I got it from has a whole bunch of old photos of him, and he looks like a vampire in just about every one. It's hilarious!

 Nice article. Lea! Some great photos there, as well. I just bought a copy of The Midnight Girl ('25) with Bela Lugosi, and am looking forward to watching it. I've never seen him in a silent.

 Thanks, Donnie! Early photos of Karloff were surprisingly hard to find, I've found, unless there's a very obvious website out there that I obliviously missed. I haven't seen The Midnight Girl-feel free to share what you think. ðŸ™‚

 This year at Cinecon I was able to see one of Boris's earlier featured roles: as the villain in "The Deadlier Sex" (1920). He had the mustache, and a kind of youthful ruggedness I'd never seen in him. Boris himself actually credited the Howard Hawks film. "The Criminal Code" (also 1931) as being the one that made him a star before Frankenstein. In the movie "Targets" (1968), Peter Bogdonavich had him talk about the importance of that movie to his career, pretty much leaving out Frankenstein altogether.

 Thanks for sharing, I seem to have missed hearing about how important The Criminal Code was, so that's good to know! I knew a lot more about Lugosi's career than Karloff's before starting this post, so a bunch of the research was new territory for me. p.s. Cineconâ€¦ah, somedayâ€¦

 HI Lea, this was a wonderful article, about two men I adore, and Oh my word Bela Lugosi certainly was even handsomer when he was younger! I enjoyed this post immensely. Bravo!

 Thank you so much!! Yes, Bela was quite the looker then-and I love how there is almost never a time when he DIDN'T seem like a vampire. Like in that lobby card above, my gosh. ðŸ˜€

 Hi Lea. That was a fun essay. Boris and Bela spent a long time learning their craft. Someone wrote a book about the films where they appeared together. I can't find the author's name.

 Karloff is interesting in the supporting role of the Hypnotist in a Lionel Barrymore horror vehicle called "The Bells" (1926). He's pretty much decked out in a Dr. Caligari cosplay! The only Lugosi silent performance I've ever watched was "The Midnight Girl," a rather forgettable film where Lugosi plays a lecherous art patron after the virtue of a young singer. I can only recall the scene where he violently attacks Lila Lee, probably because there was so little going on otherwise. Still Lugosi was good in it- the script just needed work. 
 Thanks so much for this post!

 Both of them seemed to manage to be interesting with whatever roles they were given-including the goofier ones. If anything, they had a bit more presence than many actors. Thanks for reading!

 I'd forgotten about The Bells! It's a good one, and yes, Karloff has a lot of presence as the Mesmerist. Very Caligari-esque.
