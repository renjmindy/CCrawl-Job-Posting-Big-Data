 Are you looking to work for a fast-paced logistics provider? My client's looking for a high performing individual to join as a Logistics Analyst, based in Wolverhampton paying circa £30,000. 
 You will join a growing logistics provider and analyse data to help the company identify performance trends. You'll work strategically with the Account Management team onsite and you'll present your findings to enable better management of all the company's carrier suppliers. 
 You will be responsible for nurturing and developing existing relationships with logistics partners and will work collaboratively across all business departments. You will clearly communicate all new initiatives across the business making sure all objectives are understood. You will need to create both weekly and monthly reports to communicate key findings to improve company operations. 
 You will ideally have experience of working within a final mile logistics distributor or within an in-house logistics team dealing with end-to-end logistics procedures. You will need to communicate your findings to all levels of the business via Excel, approach your tasks with a clear strategy and be a real problem solver. You will need to be organised, good at analysing figures and capable of working to tight deadlines. 
 The Logistics Analyst role is based at my client's site in Wolverhampton, paying a salary of approx. £30,000 plus benefits.
