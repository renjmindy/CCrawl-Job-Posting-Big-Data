 Is Job Hunting About Quality or Quantity? 
             Looking for a job, regardless of whether one is employed or unemployed, is not easy. The question that I wrestle with as an unemployed job seeker is the following: is the number of jobs that I apply for or applying for a job that fits my professional past and hopeful professional future more important?

            Someone arguing for quantity would state that the more jobs one applies for, the greater chance there is of being contacted for an interview. If Jane Doe is looking for a job and she applies to ten jobs over the course of an average day, she may receive an email or a phone call for about 1/3 of those jobs (which is utterly frustrating, but that is another topic for another time). The numbers are not ideal, but the more the jobs that she applies for, the greater chance that Jane has for being called for an interview. 

            Someone else arguing for quality would state that it is a waste of time to apply for a large number of jobs. A job seeker’s precious job-hunting time is better spent on the quality of the jobs, making sure that they are a good fit for the position. However, there is something to be said for taking a chance and applying for a job in which an applicant might have some, but not all of the qualities and/or experience that the employer is requesting. It might be just enough to secure an interview and have the opportunity to sell yourself as the right candidate for the position. 

            The question is, which matters more: quantity or quality?  My experience says both quantity and quality are equally important in the hunt for a new job. The more applications that a job seeker sends out, the more employers are likely to review their resume and possibly consider them as a viable candidate. However, it is also as important to apply for a job that the candidate can present themselves as a good fit.    
 
 Readers, what do you think? Which is more important: quantity or quality when it comes to the job-   hunting process?

 What Color Is Your Parachute? 2018: A Practical Manual For Job-Hunters And Career-Changers Book Review 
 Job searching is hard, period. But Richard N. Bolles is trying to make that search just a little easier. 
 Last year's edition, entitled,  What Color Is Your Parachute? 2018: A Practical Manual For Job-Hunters And Career-Changers , is a practical and reliable guide for the job hunter. In the book, Mr. Bolles talks about everything from resumes to cover letters to figuring out your ideal job and helping those who are changing their careers midway through adulthood. 
 I initially read this book in 2014, when I needed comfort during the job hunting process. I re-read the book because I will be out of work as of one week from today and I needed that same comfort. In the last four years, the book has not changed (with the exception of references that were not available 5 years ago). What I really appreciated about this book is that it both challenges the reader and provides support during a difficult time in their professional and personal lives. 
 I recommend it.

 Job Hunt 
 Looking for a job is like aiming an arrow at a target. 
 The bulls-eye is the perfect job, whatever each of us defines as the perfect job. The reality of the job search is that 70-80% of the arrows will never reach the target, with only 5-10% actually getting somewhere close to the bulls-eye. 
 A good job is not just a paycheck or the reason many of us get up at the crack of dawn five days a week. It is a reason to feel like we have accomplished something. When I am unemployed, I feel useless. It's a feeling that I hate. 
 One of the things I have been wrestling with this job search is learning to trust my gut. I sometimes don't know if the feelings I am having is just anxiety or the my gut telling me that the job I am looking at is completely wrong for me. 
 I've made that mistake in the past, ignoring my gut about a job that was the wrong fit. It just sometimes feels like I should take any job, even with this nagging feeling, just to have a job. 
 All I want is a job. A job that pays me well and that I will be happy at for a very long time. 
 Is that too much to ask?

 This hobby blog is dedicated to movie nerdom, nostalgia, and the occasional escape. In the late 90s, I worked at Blockbuster Video where they let me take home two free movies a day. I caught up on the classics and wrote movie reviews for Denver 'burbs newspapers and magazines. Today, I continue to revisit the old and discover the new on the screen. Comments and dialogue are highly encouraged. This year, I'm excited to collaborate with other writers via SLICETHELIFE in which we will share our movie genre favorites in our 2021 Movie Draft!
