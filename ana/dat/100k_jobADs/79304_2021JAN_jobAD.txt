 WHY DO WE SHOW EXPIRED LISTINGS? 
 Ful-time, live-in houseparents are needed for Christian residential child care programs. Married couples are typically hired as the primary houseparents in each house; couples and singles may work as relief workers. All of our houseparents live full-time at our four Ranch locations where they are involved in the physical, spiritual, emotional and educational development of underprivileged/at-risk children ages 6-18. 
 We are looking for employees who have a good work ethic, can work well in a team setting, and can complete paperwork in an accurate and timely manner. Must have a valid driver's license and at least a High School diploma. Experience working with children and/or degree in a related field is a plus. 
 Generous benefits package includes on and off-duty housing, medical, dental, vision plan, 401k retirement plan, paid vacation and sick leave.
