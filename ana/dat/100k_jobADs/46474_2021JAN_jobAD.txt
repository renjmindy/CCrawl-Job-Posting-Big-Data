 About the role 
 Skills:  Python, JavaScript, React, PostgreSQL, Distributed Systems, React Native 
 Your opportunity: 
 Join our tight-knit early-stage remote team that thrives on delighting users and building magical products that improve peoples' lives. As an early engineer on the team, you will work across the stack and directly own top level product and engineering objectives. 
 You will: 
 
 Build new features and products 
 Work across the engineering stack, including backend, web, and mobile 
 Own and deliver on top-level product and engineering objectives 
 Collaborate with team members across the company 
 Evolve our technical architecture, infrastructure, code quality, tools, and culture to continually step up the quality and speed of our engineering systems 
 
 This role may be a good fit if you: 
 
 Love building great products and engineering systems 
 Have strong CS fundamentals, including algorithms, data structures, system design and distributed systems 
 Write high quality code, value software testing, and uphold best practices in engineering, security and design 
 Are productive, resourceful, and an effective problem solver 
 Thrive in an early-stage startup environment with less stability and more ambiguity 
 Are interested in financial products and/or cryptocurrency 
 
 What's it like working at CoinTracker? 
 We are a fully distributed, tight-knit team spread across five countries and seven cities. We have minimal process, and the majority of our time is spent working and collaborating asynchronously through tools like Linear, Notion, Slack, Github, Figma, Intercom and Zoom. We also stay aligned and bonded through two-week sprints, standups, all hands and socials. We aim to empower every individual on the team with full transparency, ownership, autonomy, and clear objectives. 
 Some of the technical challenges we face are: 
 
 Lots of data  — billions of data points to track transactions and market pair prices. 
 Data structures & algorithms  — automated transfer detection, cost basis tracking, tax optimization, and more. Your CS fundamentals finally come in handy! 
 Scalability  — some cryptocurrency users, such as algorithmic traders, accumulate millions of transactions per year. CoinTracker needs to work seamlessly for those power crypto traders. 
 Blockchain  — whether it's running our own nodes, implementing xPub address generation and traversal, or parsing smart contracts to seamlessly support decentralized trading, we get our hands dirty with core blockchain technology. 
 Technical complexity  — integrating with hundreds of exchanges and blockchains, and supporting thousands of cryptocurrencies means we have to methodically architect our software and build critical monitoring systems to deliver a robust and accurate platform. 
 
 Sample projects you might work on: 
 
 Implement real-time transaction synchronization with blockchains and exchanges. 
 Develop a smart order routing platform to enable cryptocurrency trading across exchanges, taking into account full transaction history, tax lots, fee detection, arbitrage and slippage. 
 Implement tax loss harvesting to reduce capital gains taxes for cryptocurrency users. 
 
 Our engineering process includes: 
 
 Code reviews 
 Continuous integration 
 Multiple daily automated deployments to production 
 Automated testing with >85% code coverage 
 
 Last but not least, our tech stack is: 
 
 Web: HTML, Javascript, React, CSS, Sass 
 Mobile: React Native, Expo, GraphQL 
 Backend: Python, Flask, GraphQL, Postgres, Redis, Python RQ 
 Infrastructure: Heroku, AWS
