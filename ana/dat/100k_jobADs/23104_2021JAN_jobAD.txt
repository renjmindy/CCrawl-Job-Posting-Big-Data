  What Do I Say in the Thank You Note?  
 Work It Daily 
 April 07, 2009 
 Dear Experts, Think my question is too long to place on Twitter!! I had interview yesterday and the position was a bit different than what was explained to me on phone. I'm not 100% sure it's the right fit, but still want to send a proper thank-you note, without taking myself out of the running completely. How much do you sell yourself in the thank you if you're questioning the fit of the job?  Our Twitter Advice Project (T.A.P.) is no longer an active campaign. To find an answer to the above question, please use the "Search" box in the right-hand column of this website.
