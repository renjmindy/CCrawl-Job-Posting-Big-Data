 New dream job alert: get paid to sit on your couch and watch Disney+ 
 Posted on  April 10, 2020  by  hotcountry921  in  Lakeshore News ,  News Around the World 
 With COVID-19 grinding social activity to a complete halt, most people have turned to streaming services to cure the mounting boredom that comes with sheltering at home. Now, some streaming services want to pay people for using their service. 
 Enter Reviews.org, who has created a literal dream job for Disney fans -- tasking those who want "some extra money and something entertaining to watch to help you get through the day-to-day difficulties of COVID-19." 
 Yes, they will pay 10 lucky people $200 to sit on their couch and enjoy Disney+. Oh, they will also pay for a full year subscription, too. 
 "Literally, nobody doesn’t like free TV and free money, so you should probably enter," Reviews.org brags. "Honestly, the main requirement is that you’re an actual person who would enjoy streaming Disney+ and $200 cash. (Well . . . Visa Gift Card, actually, but still!)" 
 Better yet, you're not required to watch certain content. But, the website does have some strong recommendations like the smash hit Star Wars spinoff series The Mandalorian so you can see what all those Baby Yoda memes are about. 
 If people being dramatic in space isn't your cup of tea, Reviews.org curated a separate list of recommendations. 
 So, how do you enter? Just send an email to giveaways@reviews.org and use "Dream Job" in the email subject line. Then, just tell them your name and favorite Disney movie. If you want to write something extra, that's cool, too. 
 Those itching to apply must be a U.S. resident over 18-years-old. 
 Also, it should be obvious, but you can only enter once. Don't spam. 
 So, get cracking and submit your entry by 11:59 p.m. MST April 10, 2020. Winners will be randomly selected. 
 Disney is the parent company of ABC News.
