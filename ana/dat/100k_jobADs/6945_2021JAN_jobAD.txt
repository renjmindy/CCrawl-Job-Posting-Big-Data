  5 Things You Should Be Doing In Your Job Search  
 Alan Corey 
 December 01, 2014 
 During a job search, you might wonder what you should be doing in addition to writing up resumes and going on interviews.  Related: 5 Things You Should Be Doing If You’re Unemployed  Here are some ideas: 
 
 1. Leverage Online Word Cloud Generators 
 After you have identified the job title you are applying for, plug in 10 different online job listings for that occupation into a word cloud generator. The generator will instantly display all the words back in a pretty picture, with the most repetitive words appearing in a large and bold font. The most necessary skills and experiences you need to excel within this career choice area now easy to identify as they are the largest words on the page. 
 2. Gain Experience Quickly By Working Virtually 
 If you're switching careers or just starting out, sign up for a few low-paying freelance gigs at odesk.com or elance.com as soon as possible. You can quickly add a few projects under your belt to make up for any lacking experience you may have. 
 3. Get Press By Helping A Reporter Out 
 Submit your e-mail address at Helpareporter.com. By doing so, you’ll start to get a daily digest of interview requests for interviews about your career (or lack thereof) from topic specific blogs to widely-read national publications. Once you get your name in the paper, you’ll have a ton of exposure and can quickly be pegged as an expert in your field. 
 4. Keep An Eye On Your Online Brand 
 Create a free Google Alert of your name. This will e-mail you every time your name is mentioned online. This is a great way to screen the web for any ill-intentioned photo or description of you so you can act quickly. You’ll want to find it before a potential employer does. 
 5. Take An Online Class 
 You can never have too much education. With even Ivy League colleges offering free classes online to anyone, there is no reason you can’t join a few virtual sessions as a way to further your knowledge along with padding your resume. Coursera.org and KhanAcademy.org are great places to start.  This post was originally published at an earlier date.
