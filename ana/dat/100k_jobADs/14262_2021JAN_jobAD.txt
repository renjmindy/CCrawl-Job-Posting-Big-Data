 Yes!! Citizens can provide information concerning suspected money laundering or suspected terrorist financing to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) via a Voluntary Information Reports (VIRs). 
 This is submitted to the FIU via mail. Members of the public are also sdvised to inform law enforcement agencies (LEA).

 How to provide outstanding customer service: 
 December 1, 2020January 17, 2021  /  antoinettesydneyblog  /  Leave a comment 
 I am well on my way to reading one book every week pursuant to my new year’s resolution. This week, I am exploring “The magic of Thinking Big by David Schwartz. In one chapter he narrates a story of an irate guest at a hotel who sent a telegram to reserve a room for a single occupant but who came to the hotel clerk requesting hotel room with double occupancy. The customer insulted the clerk threatening to have him fired and questioned his intelligence. The young clerk apologized but declared that he was merely following instructions. 
 The author was next in line to deal with the clerk but was pleasantly surprised when the clerk greeted him warmly. The author told the clerk that he admired the way that he dealt with the previous customer. The clerk stated that he refused to be infuriated by a customer like that, he empathised with the man and supposed that he was having marital problems and that the man used him as a scapegoat to feel superior. The clerk added that “…underneath he is  probably a nice guy, most folks are…” 
 The author then suggested that we remember this statement the next time someone  “declares war on us. He said the best way to deal with situations like this is to let the other person say their piece, then forget about it”. 
 We have nothing to lose by following this approach. Instead of responding to their insults , especially for those of us who work in the service industry, it is wise to hold our tongue. There is nothing to gain by charging with bitter words.  The other person may in fact be experiencing some trying times and may simply want attention.  Although you may find that your minimum wage does not pay you enough to take insults, I am sure by the following week that you will forget the exchange of words.

 Top 10 ways to Launder Drug Money through a Casino: Free Anti Money Laundering Training in Trinidad!! 
 November 13, 2020January 17, 2021  /  antoinettesydneyblog  /  Leave a comment 
 In casinos it is normal practice for patrons to enter with large sums of cash on their person. They sometimes go to the cashier's cage and pay their cash and receive a chit or chips. They return to the table or game and place their bets. In Trinidad, casinos are called Private Members Clubs. Recently many restaurants also have a room where there is a roulette machine and various slot machines where patrons can gamble. 
 Here a 10 ways that money obtained from illegal activities can be laundered through a casino. 
 1.The casino may accept dirty cash and perform bank-like services where they may also facilitate money lending services; 
 2. An individual can go to the casino with dirty money and do some gambling, then cash out the chips and leave. I was told of an instance in Trinidad where the wife of a certain licensing officer was going to a certain private members club with $10,000 every night. Her husband gave her this money from bribe payments that he collected to issue licenses. 
 3.Friends or associates can be recruited to take a certain sum of cash each and they will also be given instructions to gamble on certain tables or machines and different casinos and locations. Each person can be paid a commission. They will also be told when to leave the casino of course after they receive their winnings or cash the chit or coins. ; 
 4.Use money obtained from criminal activities to purchase food and beverages with cash  that will be prepared and sold or shared at the private members club. All receipts will be kept; 
 5.Employees salaries can be paid with dirty cash as a business expense; 
 6. A limited liability can be incorporated and a company bank account can be opened. The name of the company can be something related to the gambling industry, such as a security consulting firm.  All winnings from gambling can be deposited in this account. If required to disclose source of funds, you can show the chit or receipt from the casino; 
 7.Use online gambling casinos and play with bitcoin that may request an email address and a password. Your winnings will be paid to you using bitcoin; 
 8.Rent for the casino can be paid in cash derived from the proceeds of crime; 
 9.The entire casino can be used as a front to a money laundering operation. To keep up appearances, there can be drink specials, food on sale. I was in a maxi taxi and I heard the front seat passenger tell the driver about a new restaurant in east Trinidad where beers were being sold for $21.00 TTD.  The driver exclaimed that he doubted that the restaurant would be profitable. The co-pilot stated the restaurant was being used to wash money, so it would definitely be profitable. 
 10.Dirty money can be used to gamble at the casino and then winnings can be transferred to a the bank account of a charity that was created to wash money.

 How does Failure feel ? by Antoinette Sydney 
 November 1, 2020January 17, 2021  /  antoinettesydneyblog  /  Leave a comment 
 Failure is the precursor of success. All of the lessons are learned in failure.This is where all the adjustments and upgrades are made. In my humble opinion , it is the perceived embarrassment that people feel,as a result of failure that is debilitating. 
 Allow yourself to try , and try with all your heart. Allow yourself to fail! Take that risk! It is the person that you become throughout the process that will attract your billions. 
 You are not like everyone else. You are persistent in the face of adversity , you smile! So to answer your question, failure feels familiar. It feels like I am learning valuable lessons that will align me with the path that is best for my highest good.

 Where is your record? Wrote , write,write! I am so impressed with free blogging sites such as WordPress. It allows me to look back at my years gone by. This is officially my 3rd year writing this blog! It brings me great to return to my previous blog posts! I am impressed with the quality of my thinking and writing! Writing these blogs are extremely enjoyable for me. 
 Write stuff down. From your "to do lists" to your goals, write it down. I prefer pen and paper,but the sticky note on my computer works just as well. 
 I encourage you to start your blog!!

 Are Non Profit Organizations (NPOs) supervised by the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)? 
 October 9, 2020January 17, 2021  /  antoinettesydneyblog  /  Leave a comment 
 Recommendation 8 of the Financial Action Task Force mandates that counties  assess  the adequacy of the laws and regulations with respect to Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs). NPOs are susceptible to being used to finance terrorism. In 2019, the   Non-Profit Organizations Act No. 7 of 2019 (NPOA) was enacted and is in effect. 
 By virtue of this piece of legislation, NPOs now fall under the ambit of AML/CFT/PF regime in Trinidad and Tobago. 
 The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) is the supervisor of NPOs that earn more than $500,000 in gross annual income.

 September 24, 2020November 21, 2020  /  antoinettesydneyblog  /  Leave a comment 
 
 Ensuring that appropriate risk-management systems are in place to determine whether the customer or the beneficial owner is a Politically Exposed Person (PEP), or immediate family member or close associate of a PEP (Regulation 20 (2). You may consider investing in software that will allow you to enter the name of the customer of the beneficial owner and then the software will reference this name against PEP lists, Sanctions lists. 
 Obtaining senior management approval BEFORE establishing (continuing, for existing customers) the business relationship (Reg 20 (4). The rationale is to inform senior management that there is Politically Exposed Person (PEP) who is desirous of conducting business with your entity. Management can make a decision whether to accept or reject this PEPs business.; 
 Ensuring that reasonable measures are taken to determine the source of wealth and source of funds (Reg. 20 (5). Source of funds refers to the origin of and activity that generated of the money that will be used to compete the purported transaction. Source of wealth refers to the entire body of assets that potentially generate income for the PEP.; 
 Conducting enhanced on-going monitoring of the business relationship (Reg. 20 (5) The regulated entity must from time to time conduct searches to see if there has been any adverse news in the media about the PEP such as charges or conviction for bribery or corruption or financial crimes.
