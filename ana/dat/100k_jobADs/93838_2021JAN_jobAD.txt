 Another Job Bites The Dust 
 I was laid off today. I won't lie that it hurts. Being laid off, regardless of the reasons, hurts. It is an emotional punch to the gut that takes time to heal. 
 I sort of knew what I was getting into when I accepted this job. For privacy reasons, I will not share the specifics of job or the company. But I will state that it was the most emotionally, professionally and physically trying job that I've ever had. I have never come home so exhausted. 
 There were previous opportunities to potentially leave, but I chose not to. I fought with everything I had to keep this job as long as I could. 
 I'm a believer in the duality of hard work and fate. Things happen to us for a reason, but also, we must work for what we want. 
 I know that I will find work again. If I did it before, I will do it again.

 Reely Bernie 
 This hobby blog is dedicated to movie nerdom, nostalgia, and the occasional escape. In the late 90s, I worked at Blockbuster Video where they let me take home two free movies a day. I caught up on the classics and wrote movie reviews for Denver 'burbs newspapers and magazines. Today, I continue to revisit the old and discover the new on the screen. Comments and dialogue are highly encouraged. This year, I'm excited to collaborate with other writers via SLICETHELIFE in which we will share our movie genre favorites in our 2021 Movie Draft!
