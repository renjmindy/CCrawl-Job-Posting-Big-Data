 Summer Youth Job Readiness Training 
 The Arkansas Workforce Center in Brinkley hosted their Summer Youth Job Readiness Training Class on June 8, 2017 and June 9, 2017. Multiple youth attended the class prior to beginning the Summer Work Experience Program. Specifically, this class covered topics such as Resume Writing Skills, Workplace Etiquette, Budgeting, Emergency Planning, Interviewing Skills, and Job Search Training. 
 The St. Francis Adult Education Center assisted by providing information to the participants about budgeting. In the end, the participants gained helpful skills and information needed to be successful at their worksite and in the workplace.
