 So excited, tomorrow I start as Principal Designer at PlayFirst! 
 They are the Diner Dash folks, and super nice -- I feel like I'm going to a company of friends! (By that I meant the new folks, there are three friends working there already!) 
 Wish me luck! Wheeee!

 I just finished Keen 4 again and remembered your Kickstarter project, which led me to this place somehow. 
 Just wanted to drop by and say thank you for all the wonderful childhood memories. I fondly remember playing the games with my sister, taking turns on death or level finished on my Dad's old PC. Sometimes I'd die on purpose so it would be my turn on my favorite levels. ðŸ™‚ 
 Keen was my hero as a kid and he also got me started into making my own stories, games and characters. Nothing published, but a few of them were pretty popular on the school yard. 
 So yeah.. I just wanted to say thank you for all of that. ðŸ™‚ 
 With your new job, are you still going to work on Secret Spaceship Club? If yes, just two humble suggestions that might help the game catch the athmosphere of Commander keen: 
 I think it'd help if you showed less of the map on screen I noticed while playing Keen 4 that part of the magic was not being able to look very far. The levels seemed so vast and mysterious because of it. 
 Somehow I don't like the main character. He doesn't seem nerdy and authentic like Keen does. His smile seems a bit fake. 
 Good luck with your new job. Looking forward to more games from you. ðŸ™‚

 Tom! Can you try and do anything with this  http://collective.square-enix.com/  ? Maybe pitch a return to Anachronox? I would wholeheartedly support it and spread word of it to the 4 winds!!! ðŸ™‚

 Yes! Great comment, I had the same thought after seeing the news ðŸ™‚ Please give it a pitch Mr Hall! 
 And what about Anox for iOS? I could see the controls working quite good in a touch environment.

 Hello, just checking in because I saw what Eder saw. All is quiet; I'm hoping it's because there's this awesome bank heist-like plan to get Anachronox back now that the IP is up again.
