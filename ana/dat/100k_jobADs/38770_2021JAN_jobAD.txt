 These days remote working has become a norm in different industries including the field of technology. At the same time, 9-5 and one-size-fits-all jobs are becoming less appealing. So what are some benefits to working remotely? 
 
 Spend less time spent commuting 
 Flexibility in your schedule 
 The freedom to control your time and income 
 
 Maintaining balance is one of the most difficult aspects of working at home because the work is always right there staring you in the face. “To keep you on track (and not working too much or too little), organization will be key. Get organized by creating filing systems, schedules, and to-do lists .” 
 Brush up on your communication skills: 
Because you’ll be doing your work remotely, you’ll need to have excellent communication skills. Often you won’t have the visual and verbal cues that normally help guide a conversation. “Although cell phones, instant messages, and software like Skype make it easy for people to stay in touch, the majority of your communication will be done via e-mail.” You will need to make sure that you can covey what you mean clearly and concisely. 
 Basic Requirements: 
 
 18+ 
 High School Diploma/GED 
 High-Speed internet access at home (Ethernet, no Wireless) 
 A laptop or PC (no tablets or cellphones) 
 An antivirus software 
 A quiet, noise-free space that is free of distractions
