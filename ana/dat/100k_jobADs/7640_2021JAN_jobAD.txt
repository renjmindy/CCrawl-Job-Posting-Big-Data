 How to prepare for entering the difficult job market in Canberra. 
 Written by  Matthew Coppola - Career Coach, Employment Specialist and Professional CV Writer Posted on April 27, 2020 
 Most will agree that the jobs market in Canberra is tough. You could be pondering on what you can do to prepare for entering the workforce or even make a career change. 
 I suggest that you start by searching for what jobs are currently available and what future jobs will be available. A great article to read on job hunting is  Effective job hunting is about making tailored job applications that match the vacancy and employer. 
 Updating your resume is the first step. A great idea is having more than one CV tailored for different roles that you want to apply for, as this opens up your options to suitable employment. You can write a CV and cover letter yourself. Or seek assistance from a  professional resume and cover letter writer from Canberra  , who will create for you job application documents that work to highlight the best that you have to offer a prospective employer. 
 When searching for jobs that you want to apply for, you may discover roles that require selection criteria to be addressed. Please don't ignore them! Most roles in Government will include selection criteria as part of the application process. You can address them yourself, or get help from the  Canberra selection criteria writers  at Client Centric Executive Employment Solutions. This Australian business has the expertise to write successful responses to any criterion, for any industry. 
 Reaching the interview stage is a great win and worth the battle to achieve. When you're sitting in front of the employer for an interview, you know they liked your application, which can mean you have a high chance of securing the position. Which makes it crucial that you get the interview right. You have the option of finessing your interview technique by receiving interview coaching by an  experienced coach in Canberra  , Australia who will guide and teach you to build up confidence.  Client Centric Executive Employment Solutions  offer this service, and from client reviews, are very good at doing so. 
 Don't ever to give up, stay focused and in control. For my insight on staying focused, please feel free to read this article  How to stay motivated and positive despite setbacks in securing work, by Matthew Coppola .
