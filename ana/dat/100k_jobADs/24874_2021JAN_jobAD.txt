 **On the Job Injuries Attorneys - Queens ** 
 People these days spend an increasing amount of time at work. Sometimes, it seems like you are at work more often than not. When an incident happens while you are working that requires medical attention, you may qualify for workers' compensation benefits. The claims process may not always be the quickest resolution, but it may be the only way to obtain compensation you are entitled to if your healthcare team concludes that your injury or illness is the result of work. If you suffer from one of these injuries or illnesses, you may want to consider connecting with the experienced Queens, New York on the job injuries attorneys at  Polsky, Shouldice & Rosen, P.C.  Once we understand more about your specific situation, we can advise you of your legal options accordingly. 
 Back Injuries 
 Your job may require you to do some heavy lifting or bend down quite a bit. When your muscles start to ache after a day at work, and the pain doesn't seem to be eased by over-the-counter measures, you may want to ask your doctor for a diagnosis. Back injuries, such as strains and sprains, account for some of the most common work-related injuries. If you are hurting, you may not simply be getting older. Please consider scheduling a risk-free consultation with experienced Queens, NY on the job injuries attorneys in order to explore the possibility of filing a workers’ compensation claim related to your back issues. 
 Carpal Tunnel Syndrome 
 Some jobs require repetitive use of one or more body parts. Activities like typing are everyday things workers do. Too much typing at the wrong angle may result in the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. The telltale signs of carpal tunnel include: 
 
 Numbness and tingling of the hands 
 Pain in the wrists or hands 
 Loss of grip strength 
 Shooting pain down the forearm 
 
 Carpal tunnel may require surgical intervention if left untreated for too long. It may ultimately require a change in career. If the pain in your hands, wrists, arms and/or shoulders is becoming debilitating, please contact experienced Queens, NY on the job injuries attorneys for legal guidance today. 
 COPD 
 You may not get injured so much as you get sick. Over the years, you have noticed a decline in your respiratory system, and a resulting trip to the doctor may reveal COPD. The condition is most often linked to breathing in particles that settle in the lungs and restrict breathing. If your job requires you to be exposed to chemicals or other irritants, the illness may be covered under workers' compensation. Rest assured, experienced Queens, NY on the job injuries attorneys also handle work-related illness cases. 
 Car Accident Injuries 
 Your job may require you to run out at various times of the day to pick up or deliver documents or goods, for example. If you wind up getting into a motor vehicle accident while performing a work duty, the resulting injuries may be covered under workers' compensation insurance. The qualification for this eligibility is that you were performing an assignment given to you by a superior. Even if you are out on your lunch break, but doing something your boss requested, the entire incident may fall under the workers' compensation umbrella. 
 Getting hurt or sick due to your work conditions can be costly in many ways. Experienced  Queens, NY on the job injuries attorneys  may be able to help expedite your claim and get you the relief you need.
