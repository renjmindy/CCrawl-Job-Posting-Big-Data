 How To Find Your Ideal, Family-Friendly Job 
 9/5/2016 
  0 Comments  
 Now that the kids are back at school, I know a lot of mums will be ramping up their job search efforts. 
 As a career consultant, I field a multitude of job search questions every day, so today I thought I would share my answers to the 4 questions I most commonly get asked by return-to-work women looking to find that ideal, family-friendly role. 
 1. How do I handle the gap on my CV?​ 
 ​​You don't want a potential employer having any unanswered questions about your application, so first and foremost don't avoid the gap, but explain it. Find more on how to do this    here . Focus your cover letter and CV on what you have to offer in terms of skills and capability, and highlight how you have kept your experience and industry knowledge recent and relevant during your time outside the workplace. For ideas and inspiration on how to fill your CV during your career gap, take a look at    this lis   t   being created by Multiple Minds. 
 2. What's the best way of finding a part-time or flexible job? 
 Research conducted by Timewise, the UK-based work flexibility specialists, found that while more than half of the UK workforce work part-time or flexibly, less than 1 in 10 jobs advertise this. The good news is though, they have also found that 91% of managers are willing to discuss flexible work arrangements during the recruitment process. 
 Just because a job isn't advertised as part-time or flexible, this doesn't mean it isn't possible. So if you are well qualified for a role advertised as a full-time position, our advice is go ahead and apply for it. Once you think you have a real chance in the hiring process, then you can start discussing your requirements. 
 Before you apply though, it's worth doing some research on the company to try to find out how open they are to flexibility. Do they already have employees working this way? And look carefully at the job description. Is it a role that you are sure can be done in less time or with the flexibility you're looking for? This is important because you'll need to present a good case for making flexibility work in the role should you receive a job offer. 
 3. At what stage in the job application process should I bring up flexibility? 
 The important thing to remember during the recruitment process, is that employers are only looking for the talent and skills you offer. Mentioning your flexibility requirements at the application/ cover letter stage is a no-go. At the interview stage there are no hard or fast rules, but experts tend to agree you should wait until you receive a job offer. At this stage you'll know for sure you're the best person for the job, and your request for flexibility will be taken seriously. 
 4. Is networking really that important? How do I find the time to network with my already over-scheduled and booked calendar? 
 More than 80% of jobs are found through networking, so yes, networking really IS that important. Begin building your confidence by taking baby steps. Start by simply talking and putting yourself out there. Baby groups, toddler groups and the school playground are rife with great contacts, don't overlook them. Whether it's 10 minutes or two hours, just try do one thing every day toward making connections and building your network. After all, the journey of 1,000 miles begins with a single step!
