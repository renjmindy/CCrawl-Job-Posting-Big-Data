 Hi, 
 I'm starting a dropshipping business with the aim to grow into a portfolio of brands and products. I'm keen to find a strong analytical co-founder to do this with. You don't need specific dropshipping experience (although it would be a bonus), but a diverse ecommerce background would be preferable. 
 As I'm looking for a co-founder, this isn't a paid role until the business can justify it, so initially I'm not expecting you to work full time. 
 I've previously started a few successful companies which have either been acquired or I've exited from, and I'm now looking to start my next venture. 
 If you might be interested to talk or hear more about me, send a brief response with a bit about you, your experience and what value you might be able to add. 
 Thanks!
