 Delivery Pain! Joyful Gain!!! -> 
 Job for my son 
 Apr 24 
 Posted by  NaranTeam 
 Hema's son is a marine engineer in US. For last, 4 months he was out of job. 
 Hema read the Newsletter on Switch Word. She chanted the Switch Word, "Find Divine Order Count Now Done", for the sake of her son. Within 3 days, he received a job offer from a company in Hamburg, Germany. 
 Please note that our children will not do it. We have to do it for them. That is the divine order. 
 Explanation 
 "Find Divine Order" - I need a job 
 If I get the job, I will "Count" money 
 When you want it happen? "Now" 
 "Done" - already happened 
 Please note the above Case History was discussed during the Monthly Meet, April 2009.  __

 He can also chant Switch words,"Find divine order count now done" 
he can also chant "sweetchestnut, aspen walnut" He can write the names of these flower remedies in a slip of paper and can carry the paper always. While sleeping, he can keep it under the pillow. 
When one tries anything desperately , sweetchestnut is the remedy. There is always a lurking fear,"What if i don't get?".This fear(imaginary) keeps on coming and Aspen is the remedy. Walnut is the remedy to settle down. 
best of luck

 If one would want a job, can the person chant the "find divine order count now done" instead of the parents?

 Sir, I chanted "find divine order count now done” and found a job, but it is contract job for 1 year. Can you please let me know the SW to get permanent of the same job. Also my husband is jobless for past 2 years, Can I chant "find divine order count now done" on behalf of him to get a job with good salary? He is very stressed and always in tension, he is trying hard to find job in all possible ways but unable to get one. If he gets a job, they are paying very less salary, which cannot even meet basic expenses. Please help!

 Dear Naranji, 
 MY husband lost his job a month back due to office politics. He is trying for a job in singapore. He is not getting any good offers at all. We also checked his horoscope and found that now asthama guru is going on and yelarai sani is about to start and hence such problems have cropped up..Kindly help us find a good job as soon as possible in singapore with the miracle of switch word. 
 Thanks a lot.

When i had called for the result, the MNC personnal told me my profile was on hold & the consultancy person replied that I had got rejected. I wanted a job in that particular company. Is there any way i can get reseclected again? Kindly help me out sir.
