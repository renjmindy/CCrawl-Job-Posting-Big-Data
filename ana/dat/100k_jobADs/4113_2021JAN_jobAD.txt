 The job description has to comply with the  job board posting guidelines  in order to get the best results and visibility from the job boards. 
 Do 
 
 Use common job titles 
 Advertise one job at a time, eg: ‘Nurse’, not ‘nurses’ 
 Include at least 700 characters 
 Use formatting like bold headings and lists to make text easier to read 
 Avoid discriminatory language:
 
 Yes: students, native-level, they 
 No: college students, native, he or she 
 
 
 
 Don't 
 
 Add details like salary or location to the job title 
 Include words like ‘career fairs’ or ‘help wanted 
 Add a link to apply (one is added automatically) 
 Describe more than one job, even if there is more than one opening. 
 
 
 Use a template 
 If you're not sure where to start, try importing one of our job description templates. Look for the link on the right side of the job editor to do this. These pre-written templates contain descriptions, responsibilities and requirements for hundreds of jobs.
