 February 27, 2013 
 There a lot of things job seekers do to increase their chances of getting hired. Some will revamp their resumes, their cover letters, and even their social media profiles. But what about  job search  help? In an article by executive coach, John Heckers, the job search expert says that “a good career or transition coach can make all the difference in the world” when it comes to job search. However, it's also important to  proceed with caution  when looking for professional job search services. There are plenty of recruiters out there who claim they can help you look for a job, but that likely might not be the case. What do you think? Is job search help worth paying for? Please take our poll and tell us what you think in the comment section below! [poll id="122"] Photo Credit:  Shutterstock
