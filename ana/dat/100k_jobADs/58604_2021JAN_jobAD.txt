 A Godsend-My current job 
 July 21, 2017   placeinthisworld247 
 I personally believe that God led me to where I am today and with everything I am. This is no less true concerning how I got my current job. I am a sales associate at a large store. Sometimes there is a lot of stress, and yes I do have to work very hard, but I love it. 
 The journey to my current job: 
 I worked at a thrift store for almost three years and had a lot of good experiences there too. In fact, I have applied some of what I learned about customer service in this store to my current job! However, later on, as I grew and changed, I knew God was starting to lead me somewhere else. 
 I had applied to different places for about six months, with little luck. Still, I persisted. I had applied to my current job too, but I also applied to a bookstore in my area. To my pleasure, the bookstore had called me in for an interview. It hadn't opened yet, so I was led into a dark building and basically was interviewed in a warehouse-like environment. I didn't care though; I was happy just to get interviewed. However, I was very nervous (read: too nervous), and the interview didn't go as well as I had hoped. I didn't know how to answer some of the questions and quickly found out that this job wasn't a good fit for me. Needless to say, the people at the bookstore never called me back. Since I had considered this my "dream job," I was a bit devastated, but still held out hope that I would find a good job soon. 
 A few weeks later, I went into the store (i.e where I work now) because my mom and I needed to buy items from there. So, I decided to ask whatever manager was out there the status of my resume that I had sent online there. So, I asked one of the personnel coordinators there, and she was very nice and scheduled an interview for me at 1 pm. I didn't have time to change into more formal clothes, so I had to go there with the clothes that I had on at the time. 
 1 pm came, and I was so nervous. There was also a woman there who would also become an associate and later one of my dear friends at work. I decided to make small talk with that woman who I will name "A". A was also looking for work, but unlike me, she already quit her previous job. A was also kind of nervous. We both got interviewed by one of my current managers who I will call *Chris (NOT his real name). He only asked one question about customer service. I was so surprised by how short the interview was. I did not know if I was going to get the job because I was so nervous during the interview. A and I waited for one hour to get our results and if we were going to get the job or not. Chris kept walking back and forth and updating us on progress and getting our papers, etc. 
 One hour passed, A and I were each called in separately, and I was offered the job! I felt so happy but was a little disappointed when it wasn't exactly what I wanted. However, I felt this job may be for me too, because of the opportunity to later advance and eventually I would be making more than I did at the thrift store! So, I told the store manager that I would discuss the job offer with family and tell him tomorrow whether I would accept the offer or not. 
 My family and I decided that this job would be worth it. So, I went in again, and I explained to the higher-up manager there (but not the store manager, since he wasn't there at the time) that I would accept the offer, but I would have to respectfully give the thrift store my two-week notice before starting the job. 
 After giving the two-week notice, I went to orientation. It was several hours, but I learned a lot about the company and got my schedule. I was happy that they were able to give me much better hours than at my previous job. 
 What I Learned 
 I am so glad that I accepted the offer when I did because I felt that God had led me to my current job for several reasons. 
 1.)  God wanted me to show His love to many people, whether it would be customers, my fellow co-workers, or even my managers.  --One of the reasons why I have stayed where I am at my current job is God's prodding me to show people there that they are loved and that they don't have to feel alone or unappreciated. Sometimes, I fail at this, but I pick myself back up and try again. 
 
 God wanted me to learn from the people around me.  -God wanted me to learn how not only to serve others through these three groups (customers, co-workers, and managers) of people but how to excel at my job. He wanted to humble me, by letting me know in no uncertain terms on some days, that I still have a lot to learn and to apply to my life. 
 
 3.)  God felt that I could apply my skills more effectively in this job, rather than the job at the bookstore .- While I am constantly learning new and wonderful things at my current job, I am also applying skills that I learned at my previous job to this one. For instance, at my old job, we had to always walk the customer to the item they are looking for, and I strive to always do that whenever possible and if the customer doesn't refuse or decline to be walked at my current job. Also, at my previous job, I learned from the store manager at the time that if a customer has several items that they are trying to carry, that they should be asked if they need a cart as a way to give good customer service to them. I always try to do that at this store as well. Sometimes, the customers say, "No, but thank you for asking," or something to that effect, but if they say something like, "Yes, I need a cart!," I immediately get them a cart, no questions asked. At the bookstore, there are no carts and since it is smaller, the customers don't need to be walked as much. 
 Conclusion: I thank everyone at my current and previous jobs that helped me to get to where I am at today. One more thing I learned is that when God (or your intuition) leads you somewhere, listen to that prodding. It may change your life for the better so you will be where you are supposed to be. Has God (or your intuition) ever led you to somewhere where you felt "right"? Please discuss in the comments.

 This is so interesting. I'm about to start a new job and I'm not super excited about the location but I'm trying to tell myself that I was put there for a reason and this helped a lot.

 What a great story. It's always nice to hear when people find joy and purpose in their work (what a big difference it makes for both the worker and the customer!). It's so valuable to be able to step back and see the ways in which we are led to our current circumstances.

 Faith and gratitude are two powerful weapons to have. I think it's very important to be reminded of this. God works in mysterious ways!

 It's so true, we would not be who we are or where we are now, had it not been for the people and places we've been before. Even if to us it's not optimal.
