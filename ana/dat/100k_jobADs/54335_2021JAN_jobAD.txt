 SMASH - Save Money and Stay Healthy - is an exciting new app that gives 13 to 24 year olds money off the  healthier food options  at the places they like to eat, including fast food chains, restaurants, supermarkets, sandwich bars and coffee shops. 
 In this post-COVID world, we want young adults to  have easier, cheaper access to healthier options  to enable them to benefit from the healthier choices they want to make. 
 The brainchild of ex-KFC board member Chris Holmes, ably assisted by ex-Accenture / Dyson digital expert Emma Hollis, finance whizz Mark Currie, nutritionist Jenny Rosborough, and with Ella's kitchen founder Paul Lindley as chair, SMASH has attracted financial backing from Guy's & St Thomas' charity and support from BiteBack 2030, along with a number of private investors. 
 And now we need you … 
 So if you're a positive thinker, up for disrupting the status quo in healthy eating to shine a light on the good stuff that's out there, and fancy being a critical part of a growing tech start-up … then what are you waiting for? Say hi!
