 LOVE WHAT YOU DO 
 
 "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. 
 And the only way to do great work is to love what you do." 
 ~Steve Jobs~

 FOLLOW THE PATH 
 
 Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. 
 They somehow already know what you truly want to become. 
 Everything else is secondary.

 A dear blogger friend taught me this concept. 
 You can find Michelle here: http://mchelsmusings.wordpress.com/ 
 ~IN HER OWN WORDS~ 
 “  IOTD  ” is image of the day, a concept I came up with. I teach visual meditative therapy – or in easy terms – a mini mental holiday. For some people it is very difficult for them to get their image right. I post an image a day for people to use in their mini mental vacay. Some are serious, some are silly, and some are just beautiful!”

 About Steve Jobs 
 A child put up for adoption soon after birth, a college dropout who just had a single calligraphy course as his formal education could never have been a millionaire until he is Steve Jobs. 
 Now this name is synonymous with élan. Jobs preached that no matter what happens in your life, struggles in school or an unsuccessful career path — every aspect will somehow help you down the road. 
 
 
 "Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards," Jobs said. "So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. 
 This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life." 
 
 
 Jobs gave an inspiring commencement address at Stanford in 2005. 
 Though he is not with us anymore, he made sure that he leaves behind a giant company we all know it today as the Apple.

 To start the day …. "You gotta find what you love to do"!!

 “You’ve got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. 
 Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don’t settle. 
 Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.”

 January 2, 2015 
 Trolling around cyberspace, looking for "inspiration" for my first post today, I found this wonderful video from the Journey of Purpose (TJOP). It "talked" to me. It made me think about my life … and it comes at the perfect time of the year … the second day of 2015. 
 I will try to use this as an inspiration for every new day in my life. 
 Hope you enjoy it. 
 
 Here is a great video by The Journey of Purpose which contains very inspiring messages by Randy Pausch, Steve Jobs and Will Smith. 
 This video is a huge eye opener and big wake up call for those who are just floating through life, not living everyday to their full potential. It’s important to follow your passion, and these 3 wise men share why this is so. 
 " As it appears in … "

 Horty 
 I'm originally from Puerto Rico. I was born in Santurce and raised in Rio Piedras. I currently live in Florida - since 1999. I have a doctorate degree in Medicine; completed in 1976. My Internal Medicine specialty was completed in 1979. Worked for Puerto Rico's health system until 1985. At this time, I'm happily retired after working for the federal government for almost 28yrs. I also worked for the government of Puerto Rico from 1979 through 1985 .... for a total of almost 40 years as a physician. I want to offer any knowledge that I have to anyone "out there" who is interested. My views are liberal in almost every sense. My knowledge is "eclectic" - a bit of everything. Music and reading are my passion. Blogging has also become a very interesting endeavor. Metaphysical topics attract me. I'm interested in news - reporting human issues like injustice, discrimination and abuse - the "wrongly" affected. My intention is to bring this knowledge to an understandable level and to help anyone in need. I'm open to questions and will answer them to the best of my ability. Currently working on an enterprise whose main mission will be to bring peoples of all walks of life together. To be one .... since we ALL are ONE!! The future looks bright and promising!!!
