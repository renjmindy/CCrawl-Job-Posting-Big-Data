 Job time! 
 March 10, 2017February 24, 2017   Anna 
 I have a job. Like a legit, real job. Four whole months before I graduated… and it feel's amazing. Job hunting as a nursing student was something I have never experienced before. I went on what felt like an endless number of interviews, but I received an offer from every hospital I interviewed with. I got some offers I didn't want, some that were intriguing, and an offer in my dream spot. 
 If you are interested in what interviewing as a nursing student is like, let me know. I am happy to write about it. 
 But… on with the story! I have accepted a position with a community based hospital in the poorer end of my city as an ER nurse. 
 I am absolutely thrilled. I am really pleased to be working with the population that this hospital serves. Plus, being an ER nurse has been my goal for most of nursing school. I would be lying if I didn't admit that I am scared senseless. But I am also excited. And scared. And excited. I've been told that is perfectly normal as a new nurse.
