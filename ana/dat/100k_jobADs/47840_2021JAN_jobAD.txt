 Regular internal and external training courses are a matter of course for us. With the Willi Elbe Group Academy we have our own training platform. This enables us to specifically promote the further training of our employees. 
 In good hands 
 Our international presence, with eight plants in Europe, America and Asia, minimizes risks and ensures future-proof jobs. This is why, as a rule, we have permanent employment contracts. 
 A great career start 
 Flat hierarchies, respect, tolerance and a friendly working atmosphere: At the Willi Elbe Group you can expect intensive training and attractive jobs, with performance-related pay. 
 Far-sighted 
 Steering technology and drive technology at the Willi Elbe Group is consistently based on lightweight technologies. That's good for the environment - and will therefore remain important for many years to come. Independent of the drive concept.
