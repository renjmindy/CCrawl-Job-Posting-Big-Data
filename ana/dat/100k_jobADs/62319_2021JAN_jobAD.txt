 Are you a Warehouse Shift Manager looking for a new challenge at the start of 2020? I'm recruiting for a PM Shift Manager (Backshift) with working hours of 12.30pm - 9pm Monday to Friday… 
 I have an exciting opportunity to join a leading distribution business, they are looking to recruit a PM Warehouse Shift Manager as they go through an exciting period of change with the implementation of a brand-new state of the art WMS operating system. Based in Birmingham the successful candidate will earn a competitive salary c£32,000 with a fantastic shift pattern working Monday to Friday 12.30pm - 9pm (flex will be needed surrounding this as per demand). 
 The successful candidate will have an autonomous role reporting directly to a Warehouse Manager, and as such you will manage your team with a focus on productivity and driving performance. You will manage your team accordingly and as part of the role you will train and mentor them where necessary. 
 The site is an industrial environment where the key responsibilities will be to engage with your team to drive shift productivity. There is definite career progression for the right candidate as the company have a proven record of promoting from within. They have worked very hard on producing a great culture onsite where everyone is pulling in the same direction. The company deliver most of their material on a next day basis so a manager who can work within fluctuations of volume demand would be a good fit here. A candidate with experience within e-fulfilment could transition nicely into this role, their peak time on this shift tends to fall between 4pm - 6pm. 
 The company is in an exciting growth phase over the next 12 months, with the implementation of the new WMS system it should help the management team to focus strongly on shift KPIs and how to get the best productivity onsite. A distribution background would be beneficial and possibly e-comm experience also, a candidate who can demonstrate managing a team in a demanding distribution environment would be perfect. 
 Based in Birmingham you will be paid a competitive salary c£32,000, the role will suit a self-starter who is team driven and can communicate at all levels.
