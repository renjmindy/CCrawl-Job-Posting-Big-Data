 The online outsourcing marketplace, Freelancer.com, has released recently its list of the top 50 freelance job trends for the fourth quarter of 2011 ( press release  and  PDF ). It gathered the stats from 134,820 online jobs that posted over the last quarter of the year, which represent 18.3% job posting increase from the prior quarter. 
 Important Trending Freelance Jobs (Full List At The Bottom): 
 Data-  Data entry freelance jobs (54% growth) and Microsoft Excel jobs (51% growth) are the fastest growing online jobs of the quarter. Their increase is mostly attributed to many entrepreneurs that are hiring freelancers for market research, analysis and for more information services. Data processing jobs also had a meaningful increase of 39%. 
 Mobile-  There is a significant rising for almost all mobile-related freelance jobs. Android jobs jumped by 33%, iPad jobs rose by 22%, iPhone jobs grew by 18% and general mobile phone jobs grew by 12%, all in great volumes. Other big jumpers, however in low volumes, were Kindle jobs (27%). Freelance jobs for Nokia provided a big drop of 19%. 
 Programming-  Programing-related freelance jobs also had an amazing quarter which provided more jobs for developers of C++ (38% increase), Java (36% increase), C (27% increase), .NET (27% increase) and C# (20%). PHP jobs, which has the most demand on the marketplace in general, grew by 13%. 
 Social Networking-  Overall, this industry keeps growing gradually. Facebook jobs are up by 29%, Twitter jobs are up by 16% and general social networking jobs are up by 26%. Although Google+ jobs didn’t enter the top 50 list (too low volume), they began appearing on the marketplace for the first time. MySpace jobs generated a big fall of 35%, reflecting on the poor social network status.
