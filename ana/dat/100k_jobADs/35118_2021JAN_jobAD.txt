 When it comes to working from home, there can’t be many jobs more enjoyable than getting paid to test video games! 
 The idea is a simple one…game producers need to make sure that their games run without bugs or errors prior to public release, and to do this they enlist the help of “beta testers”. 
 Beta testers then get to play a pre-release version of the game, where they are required to spot either any flaws within the game, or will be asked to assess parts/sections of the game for specific problems. 
 Ok, let’s take a step back and look at the potential of video game tester jobs as a way of earning a good income from home. First of all… 
 What skills do you need as a games tester? 
 Most people assume that being good at playing games is the only skill you need, but that isn’t the case. 
 If a company is prepared to pay you to test their game, they are not just after someone who can kill the most zombies, do the fastest lap, or rack up the highest score. 
 In exchange for payment, they require you to have an eye for attention to detail because more often than not, bugs are easy to miss. 
 You will not be the only person beta testing the game, so if they find that you are missing bugs that others are picking up, it could harm your chances of ongoing work. 
 You will also be expected to be able to record and report any bugs or errors that you might find. 
 The method you use for this can vary greatly from job to job, but typically you will be required to record exact details of any errors that you find, and report them accordingly. 
 Again, if you cannot do this is an efficient manner it is likely to harm your ongoing potential. 
 How much time do you have to spend testing games? 
 This can obviously vary from game to game, but you are likely to find that you will be required to spend a good few hours on each game. 
 Let’s face it…if you enjoy playing games then this won’t be a problem, but if you’re thinking this is a job that you can do completely at your leisure, think again. 
 Unlike some of the  other online methods mentioned here on Work From Home Watchdog , video game tester jobs generally require a greater time investment. 
 However, the financial and pleasure rewards can make it very worthwhile. 
 How much can you expect to earn as a games tester? 
 According to Matthew Johnson of  www.becomeagamestester.com , he was able to earn between $20 - $50 per hour and a total of $70,000 a year from testing games from home. 
 However, I would say a realistic starting figure would be $20,000 per year, but the potential for earning a good income as a games tester is definitely there.
