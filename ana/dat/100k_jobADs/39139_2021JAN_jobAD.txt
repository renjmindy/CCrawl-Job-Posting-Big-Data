 Ms. Cantarona, 
 To know more on how you can work in UK as a caregiver, you should read my article titled Caregiver UK Tips. It is filed under the category Useful Informations. The category section can be found on the left side of the same website Caregiver Work Abroad. 
 But there are other options, and one of them is to work in UK under a student visa. To know the details, read my article titled Caregiver Training in UK. It is also on the same website Caregiver Work Abroad. 
 The other option is through a local recruitment agency in the Philippines. Just recently, the POEA approved for recruitment a job order for UK Jobs in Care. To know the details, just read my article titled UK Jobs in Care. But be sure to check with the recruitment agency involved if the job order is still active or not. 
 For more agencies offering nanny and caregiver jobs, I suggest that you also visit my other website Nanny Jobs Online at jobsnanny.com 
 Thanks for visiting my website Caregiver Work Abroad.
