 Full Stack Engineer wanted to work on our Investment Management Team 
 Role overview 
 Weâ€™re innovators, changemakers, and collaborators. Weâ€™re more than just a software company â€” weâ€™re a cloud-based powerhouse that creates products to make our customersâ€™ lives easier. Weâ€™re revolutionizing the way people do business, and we wâ€‹ant your ideas, your enthusiasm, and your passionâ€‹ to help us keep on innovating. 
 We love where we work, and you can, too. 
 What Youâ€™ll Do 
 
 Develop scalable, robust, and simple wâ€‹eb-based solutions to solve complex business problems 
 Formulate, implement, and evaluate â€‹algorithms and database queries to support SaaS scalability and stability. 
 Implement new features â€‹and optimize existing ones to drive maximum performance 
 Use test-driven development, code reviews, and continuous integration tâ€‹o deliver high-quality software, and rapidly fix bugs as they come up. 
 Work closely with, and incorporate feedback fromâ€‹ other engineering team members, QA, and product owners 
 Leverage agile practices iâ€‹n start-up mode, encourage collaboration, prioritization, and urgency to develop at a rapid pace 
 Research, share and recommend â€‹new technologies and trends 
 
 What Weâ€™re Looking For 
 We are hiring a Senior Full Stack Software Engineer to contribute to our rapid product development pace. We work collaboratively to set the technical direction for our SaaS products, developing easy-to-use solutions for our customers. Our engineers find deep satisfaction in building things that customers actually need. We focus on delivering value to customers and understand that this often means delivering code that isn't perfect but meets customer needs. 
 This is an ideal opportunity for someone who has a passion for building leading-edge software and is driven to help build a successful SaaS product used by thousands of happy businesses. We foster an environment that empowers small teams to collaboratively set the technical direction of our solutions. 
 You know youâ€™re the right fit if... 
 
 Youâ€™ve heard of Ruby and Rails, and have some experience working with a language like Ruby, Java, or Python. You may even know enough about Javascript to have opinions about how frequently "the new hot thing" changes. 
 You love learning about new technologies, but understand the value of continuing to use something old if it still does everything you need it to do. 
 You care about the long-term maintainability of the codebase and will learn to advocate for refactoring and clean-ups where appropriate. 
 You care about work-life balance and want your company to care about it too; you'll put in the extra hour when needed but won't let it become a habit. 
 
 Must-Haves 
 
 BS, MS, or Ph.D. in Computer Science or related technical discipline 
 Extensive hands-on work experience developing web-based applications, preferably in a SaaS environment 
 Proven experience working across all levels of the development stack 
 Mastery experience with some areas of our tech like Ruby on Rails, React, Redux, AWS, SOA 
 Strong familiarity with Agile software development processes: Scrum or Kanban 
 Strong familiarity with Test-Driven-Development 
 Creativity, ability to solve complex problems without a roadmap 
 
 At AppFolio,â€‹  we value diversity in backgrounds and perspectives and depend on it to drive our innovative cultureâ€‹ . Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re a proud Equal Opportunity Employer, and we believe that our products, our teams, and our business are stronger because of it. This means that no matter what race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identification, national origin, age, marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, or veteran status, youâ€™re always welcome at AppFolio.
