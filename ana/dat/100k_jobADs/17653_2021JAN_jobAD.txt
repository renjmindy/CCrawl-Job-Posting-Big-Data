 Finding a job with WorkPac: Part Two 
 27/08/2018BY: Tracey Mesken 
 ​If you haven’t already, make sure you check out  Part One  of this post, where we covered the registration process, and the best way to search for roles. For Part Two we’ll be covering the application process and how to set up a Job Alert. 
 *Preparing for your next job interview 
 ​ 
 Your job alert is separate to your myworkpac account, so you will need to begin by setting that up. 
 ​ 
 Now that you have an account, it’s time to start setting up your alerts. You create a job alert directly from the from the Job Alerts page, or you can set one up while doing a job search. Here, we’ll demonstrate how to do both.
