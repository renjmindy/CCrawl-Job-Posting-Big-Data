 Company Benefits 
 We offer a fun and productive work environment. We believe Family comes first and nurture a Work/Life balance that works for all. 
 Company Description 
 We are a small Land Surveying and Mapping firm incorporated in 2003. We have 2 licensed professional land surveyors; we use the latest Trimble and Topcon field equipment. We invest in technology as needed to stay competitive without sacrificing the quality of our work. We strive to provide the most complete work we take on. Our primary focus is boundary related surveys. We will take the small lot survey as well as the large tracts of land. Our work is primarily in the high country of Colorado. We have worked both sides of the Continental Divide from southern Colorado to northern Colorado. We will travel, at times. 
Grand County has been our primary office location since 2005. The majority of our work has been for the private land owners that realize the importance of knowing where their property lines and corners are.
