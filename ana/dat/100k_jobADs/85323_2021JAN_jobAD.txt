 Jaclyn Zukerman's (JZ) business to get her clients on scene where it matters. She has hundreds of thousands of social media connections and loyal followers all looking for the very latest trends, fashion, inspiring products, and cutting edge business ventures. 
 Originally from New York, JZ relocated to Boston in 2014 and has been blazing a trail ever since. Based in Everett, MA, she is the CEO of JZ Social Enterprises LLC , Editor in Chief of NEXTonSCENE® magazine, podcast broadcaster for “ NEXTonSCENE® with JZ ”, and a producer of high quality promotional events and PR campaigns. 
 Simply put, JZ is passionate about getting people talking. When she's not busy enabling new trends JZ takes time out with her husband, works out, and hangs with her right hand pup, Hershey. 
 1) How did you get started working from home? 
 I had the drive and passion to create my own hours and schedule! 
 2) How did you choose the work-at-home career you do? 
 I kind of fell into it as it felt like a natural talent to promote people and give them a voice. My clients since working with me have been placed in the daytime Emmys, on the Voice, and won America's Got Talent. It is truly amazing to see since being on my platforms the things they have accomplished! 
 3) How did you get your first client or customer or job? 
 I found a missing market that was needed for start-ups and small businesses that was cost effective to get them placed in reliable great quality outlets, and my business of started to blossom. 
 4) How do you market your business? 
 Via social media and now clients even find me via my website on Google! 
 5) What does your usual day look like? 
 I wake up, read affirmations, walk my pup, oversee my emails with some some great iced-coffee, workout, record a podcast, work on the magazine, oversee planning my quarterly events, and then, at least 2-3 nights a week, I am out at networking events if I am not running them. 
 6) What do you know now that you wish you knew when you started? 
 Take chances, you never know what's possible if you don't try. If they don't work out don't give up because something more amazing will open up if you are truly passionate about what you are doing ! 
 7) What advice would you give someone who wants to work from home? 
 Create a schedule for yourself, will keep your drive more aligned and get you excited for your work!
