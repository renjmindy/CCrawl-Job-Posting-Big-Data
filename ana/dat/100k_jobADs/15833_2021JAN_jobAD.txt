 The 29 November announcement by Adani Mining stating that it has secured finance to develop its Carmichael coal mine and rail link is a significant and welcome boost for regional communities, jobs and the Australian mining industry. 
 The Queensland and Australian economies will benefit from thousands of new regional jobs and long-term investment in the mine and rail infrastructure. 
 And through mining taxes and royalties, the Carmichael mine will generate billions of dollars for taxpayers over decades to fund nurses, teachers, police, hospitals, roads and other services and infrastructure for Queensland families and communities. 
 The mine will also open up the North Galilee Basin for further development - an exciting new phase in Australia's rich history of mining exploration and development which has made the nation a global mining powerhouse. 
 With routine State and Federal environmental management plans set to be finalised shortly, work can get underway to build and develop the mine so benefits can flow to local businesses and the community.
