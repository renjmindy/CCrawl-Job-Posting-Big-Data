  How Do I Explain My 'Other' Job?  
 Work It Daily 
 September 14, 2009 
 Dear Experts, I was at an interview last week with a company for a sales job, I was doing great in the interview and then they mentioned the occasional need to travel on the weekends. This wasn't in the job description online when I applied. I said I have a weekend job and it would be tough but I would need advance notice. The interviewer looked at my resume and noticed a current part-time job wasn't listed, so she asked me what I did. I stammered and said I wasn't at liberty to say. The truth is, I'm a male stripper. I started in college part-time and make great money. So, I don't want to give it up. What should I do? The company hasn't called since and I'm sure it's because she thinks I'm lying to her, but if I call and say what I do I'm guessing I won't get the job either.  Here is how our T.A.P. experts answered this question:   Q#288  Depending on position, PT job may block emp. Think: Sat nite strip-Mon a.m. biz mtg w/ someone recognz U. Difficult spot. ( @dawnbugni )  Q#288  If travel involved u will need 2 make arrangements as part of full-time role. No need to mention. [1/2] ( @DebraWheatman )  Q#288  Learn frm. the experience from this interview. For ur career, do not mention other role. Not a business conflict. [2/2] ( @DebraWheatman )  Q#288  Answer to question: Don't explain. Next time: "I'm not availalbe during weekends." When pressed: family obligations. ( @CareerBranches )  Q#288  Cloaking ur response not good. Agree w/ @AskAManager : frame it as work at club. Chalk it up as interview practice. ( @ValueIntoWords )  Q#288  Saying you weren't willing to say sounds sketchy. Should have said you worked at a club. Probably too late to fix now. ( @AskAManager )  Q#288  Do u want ST $ or LT gain? Ur choice. & is sales 4 u now? Sales often requires travel, wknd, nite wk. ( @juliaerickson )  Q#288  You may be out of luck, so just move on. If you appear to be hiding something, it can be a big turn-off for employers. ( @gradversity )  Q#288  Too late to fix interview. PLUS PT stripper job will lead to more professional roadblocks. Make a change.( @jtodonnell )  Q#288  I'd stop stripping if I could get a sales gig I enjoyed. Income potential=much higher. ( @beneubanks )  Q#288  No legal obligtn 2 tell abt pt job, but I would be honest. If you're not hired b/c of it, u know fit is wrong.
