 Catherine Morland's Reading List: The Distant Hours 
 So the idea of _Catherine Morland 's Reading List _came mostly from the fact that I am a huge Gothic fiction/mystery fan. Before I met Jane Austen I devoured all these books that  I know  , if Catherine was alive,  she  would have been reading. 
 It started with reading one, and then before I knew it I had a list of thirty I was planning on eventually reviewing. What can I say… 
 The next book I think Catherine Morland would read is… 
 The Distant Hours  by Kate Morton 
 I read  The Secret Keeper  by Kate Morton and really enjoyed it. I was shelving books in the library and spotted this book and it called to me, you know like books do. I picked it up and knew I had to read it, as it is perfect to add to this list. 
 So first of all this book is amazing in how it was printed. The cover pages are set up like the cover pages of old books, looking like they are worn, torn, folded, etc. The prologue begins with a snippet from gothic story,  The Mud Man  , and I was instantly hooked. 
 This story is a Gothic Novel Lovers dream! It has a scattering of references to other novels, like the trail of breadcrumbs Hansel and Gretel left-this one leading you to the conclusion. 
 W have the prologue of the Mud Man and I wish it was a real book. It is so creepy! 
 The book is told between a few different timelines, we have 1992 (present) and 1940s (past). The story starts off with our main character narrating the story, reminiscent of  Wuthering Heights , which continues as she tries to search for the truth of a family secret, just like how the main character does there. 
 I'm telling you, this is like Gothic Novel bingo! 
 Edie works for a book publisher as she loves reading. It is very small and starting to die out, only saved by Edie's moxie as she doesn't really want to start over. 
 So it starts off with an unlikely beginning, (after the Mud Man story). Back in WWII a postman became a bit too inebriated and forgot to mail a bag of letters. Said bag was discovered years later, with it becoming a huge story in the media. 
 Wow! 
 Edie's mother was one of the people who received a letter, but instead of being happy about the missive that went away she became  extremely upset  about it, and asked Edie to leave. 
 Edie forgets all about it until she heads to Kent to sign an author. There she passes this amazing castle, Milderhurst Castle, the owner being Raymond Blythe-the author of Edie's favorite book,  The Mud Man . 
 Wow! 
 She purchases a copy of  The Mud Man  and another book on the history of the Blythes, and when she hears of tours to the castle she heartily wants to do it! 
 However, the Blythe sisters don't allow tours anymore as they are growing older and have a younger sister who has dementia. But for some strange reason they agree to let her. 
 Edie is fascinated by the castle, and the strange family. (There is this part where they talk about the tubes going through the castle like in the Vincent Price radio drama  Fugue in C-Minor ). But it isn't until the younger sister Juniper calls her her mother's name-that Edie is hooked! 
 Huh? 
 Why did she think she was her mother? How does she know her mother? 
 What the heck? 
 Meanwhile, back in WWII the Blythe sisters are having some issues. The world may be at war, but they are too. 
 The elder sister Percy loves the castle, as if it was a part of her. She doesn't want any thing to happen to it, and will do anything and everything she can to keep it going. She especially doesn't want her sisters to leave as she has no knowledge or use for cooking, laundry, or any thing that really keeps the castle going and with no money to do it she needs her younger sister. 
 The middle daughter Saffy dreams of being a writer, a nanny, a research assistant, pretty much anything if she can get to London. But every time she tries to go-her twin Percy makes her stay. Poor girl, she'll be stuck here forever. 
 Juniper is beautiful, intelligent, talented, the whole package. But she needs to be cared for as her mood swings take her to dark, dark places; she seems almost manic depressive with her mood swings and possibly schizophrenic. She goes to London and wants to stay there and get married to an army officer, who happen to be Merry's teacher. 
 Merry, Edie's mother, did not want to leave London during the bombings in WWII. She cried the whole way on the train and was one of the last to be picked. She was saved when Juniper came storming in and claimed her for their house. Merry came from a lower middle class family and finds herself in a brand new world when she goes into the castle. Books upon books, a family that values daydreaming, writing, etc-all the things that Merry was looked down back at home for liking. She loved being in the castle so much that when her parents came to take her home, she didn't want to go back. But she does have to…and while she still sees Juniper when she comes to the city, she developed a serious crush on her teacher turned soldier. When she finds out the two are getting married, she is heartbroken as she was sure he felt something for her. 
 Aw, that's sad. 
 Like every castle, this one holds dark, deep secrets-  generational  secrets. Ones that Edie gets involved with. First she tries to figure out her mother's connection to it, and then when her father is recuperating from a heart attack and bored-she reads to him  The Mud Man  and they begin searching what could have been the origin of the story. 
 Hmmm… 
 She also gets asked to help write the new edition of  The Mud Man  , going back to the Castle and interviewing the ladies. Will she discover the secret to the idea of  The Mud Man  , why her mother is connected and upset over the past, and  what  really keeps those sisters anchored there? 
 This is a fantastic book, with amazing characters full of depth. If you like Gothic novels you will go ga-ga over this. You can clearly see how much the author loved gothic novels and loves books-she goes on and on about them (I clocked  Wuthering Heights, The Yellow Wallpaper, Rebecca  , etc.) This author is a spooky girl! 
 The end was is very cute with her father getting interested in reading fiction and novels after they read  The Mud Man  together. 
 And the twist of how the mud man came to be, the truth behind who the monster is-wow! 
 Wow! 
 There were two things I didn't like about this book though: there is a point in the third act where the book drags, I would have cut those pages as they didn't really add to the story. 
 And there is a whole section about what did Juniper do that night? Everyone is scared as she is late coming home, covered in someone else's blood, and coming out of a "mood"; but they never resolve it. What did she do that night?
