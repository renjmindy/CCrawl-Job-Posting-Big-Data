 15 Oct 
 There are many career choices available. Some make sense, others less so.  Colin Ireland  is a case in point. He wanted to commit the perfect murder but he also wanted to be a  famous serial killer . Difficult to be both. The perfect murder means the case is never solved while to be famous everyone must know what you did. A real problem for Colin. 
 
 Here is a  great article  from Dr. Katherine Ramsland on Colin’s dilemma.
