 How Healthy Is Your Network? 
 
 We all apparently know 250 people….. some of you may be responding "yes of course I do?" or "really I don't even know 10!". Well when it comes to networking it doesn't really matter how many we do know it is how we manage the connections we do have. It is also important to continually manage your connections in a strategic way to keep your network current and alive. 
 When was the last time you sat down to take a strategic look at your current network to see if this is in area you need to do some work on. For most people it becomes important when they find themselves job hunting. Suddenly we start picking up the phone or sending emails to people we haven't connected with for a very long time in the hope they might know of some suitable roles. This is far from ideal. 
 A high performer (job hunting or not) continually manages their network, keeps connected with everyone but in different ways and in different timeframes. The skilled networker is just as keen to help others grow their networks and put people in touch with each other as they are to make new connections themselves. There is nothing more rewarding than putting two people in touch with each other that can help both people achieve personal or work goals. 
 When you sit down to strategically review your network do you have any gaps? Do you have people who challenge your thinking, do you have people who you can go to who inspire you?, do you have people in your network who you can contact when things get really tough and you need some advice? Do you have people in your network who have an equally good network when you are looking to hire people or get specific expert advice on a subject? 
 What sort of person are you in other peoples network? Its a two way street networking when it works well…….

 Energy, Focus, Action 
 I have met a lot of different people this week … Working with corporate clients, holding events and being a guest at 3 different hotels, plus attending a careers event last night at the  University West of England.  
 When I think of the people who have impressed me the most this week they have all displayed the 3 qualities in the title of this blog: 
 
 Energy -  going about their job in a positive way and demonstrating they enjoy what they do. 
 Focus -  on what they are doing; be that customer service, being part of a management team, or students focused on activities that support their career options. 
 Action -  taken to meet customer needs, to meet team goals, or to proactively own their career. 
 
 If I also reflect on the people I enjoy working with - the people I want to be part of my team and the people I choose to recruit – these are the qualities I look for in an individual. 
 
 I often talk about Energy Givers and Energy Takers. 
 Which are you?
