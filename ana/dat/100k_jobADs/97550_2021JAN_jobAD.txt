 I have a job

 The title says it all really! It's been 6 months since I left ACUMED (wow, time flies), but it seems that I am now about to be employed again. 
 My new job title is 'Orientation Consultant' and I will be helping new expats settle in to Wuxi. I think it will suit me really well for a number of reasons: 
 
 I will only be working on an occasional basis, so I will still be able to make time to look after any visitors we get. 
 I will get to meet the new foreigners who come to Wuxi. It's always very interesting to find out where people come from and what they do. 
 I will get to nosy around all the different styles of apartments with them. Brilliant! 
 
 The company is based in Shanghai and is well-established. I had an interview at the end of last month and the interviewer seems really nice. There is a training day next week in Shanghai, but then it might be a while until they need me to do anything. I am very excited though.

 That's really good news, Laura. I'm sure the job will suit you down to ground, knowing how efficient you at organising people (like me for instance - how will I ever find my way around Manchester without you!)
