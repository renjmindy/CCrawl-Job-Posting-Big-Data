 Suggested Resources 
 This is an ongoing bibliography on antiracism and teaching that is collectively curated by MRECC throughout the year. The goal is to increase awareness and meaningful engagement with current antiracism resources including books, articles, blogs, interviews, and podcasts. The categories below are arranged intentionally to encourage readers to engage heavily with resources produced outside of Classics. We prioritize publications by Black authors, Indigenous authors, and People of Color (BIPOC). Links are provided to open-access materials wherever possible to increase access and engagement. We hope this arrangement inspires you to take action and learn new ways to reimagine Classics pedagogy by joining the ongoing conversations with teachers, scholars, and activists in other fields and around the world. 
 Please send suggestions for additions or changes to multiculturalclassics@gmail.com. We also welcome you to share with us how you are using these materials to inform your teaching and your students.
