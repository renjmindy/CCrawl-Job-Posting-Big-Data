  5 Reasons You Should Have A Job Search Plan (And How Career Coaching Can Help)

 Your job search can be so much more than just looking at online job listings and sending out generic resumes and cover letters that you send to every other company. 
 Whether you're a college student, recent graduate, or mid-level job seeker, you could learn more about yourself and the types of jobs want with our  career growth club's  resources. 
 
 Here are our top five reasons you should have a job search plan, and what we learned from a career coach. 
 The Importance Of A Disruptive Checklist 
 If you don't know where to start with your job search, a  disruptive job search checklist  can help you keep track of what you need to do besides revamping your resume, cover letter, LinkedIn profile, and more. 
 It's important to take some time to reflect on your skills, strengths, weaknesses, and fears before you jump ahead to job applications and interviews.  A disruptive job search checklist can help you address all of these concerns and more as you look for your next job. 
 How To Identify Your Fears And Goals 
 Entering the job market during a pandemic can be a daunting experience, especially if it is your first job. However, there are simple steps that you can follow to  boost your confidence  and have a clear image of what you want. 
 For example, we recommend that job seekers identify their fears by writing them down on a checklist.  Once those fears are identified, you can come up with a fear-fighting mechanism: a mantra or a phrase you repeat to yourself when those fears occupy your head. 
 As you launch your journey in search of a job, it will also help if you identify your goals as it will give employers reasons why they should hire you. Ask yourself how your skills can improve a company's performance or work operations. 
 Identifying your goals helps you create your personal brand that makes you stand out from others, and you can start by answering these simple questions in our disruptive checklist. 
 How To Make Long-Term Goals 
 Securing a job could be defined as being a short-term goal that is fulfilled once you are hired. However, sustaining a job and  developing your skills  are part of planning for long term goals, such as a  30-60-90 day plan . 
 Our career growth club can help you determine these goals.  When you work on expanding your network and developing a reading ritual to research different companies, you can make progress in achieving your goals. 
 Learn More About Yourself And Your Priorities 
 If you're a college student or recent graduate, you may be thinking that you should be grateful for any and all job offers and opportunities that come your way. In reality, you should think about your own needs and wants, too. 
 A disruptive checklist can help you visualize exactly what you want, need, and don't want in a job or company in the long term.  Once you have these written down, you can research companies that match your needs. 
 You may also discover that you are asking too much or too little from a company during your job search. Want to learn more about yourself? Take this  free workplace persona quiz  to find out what kind of employee you are. 
 How To Improve Expand Your Network 
 Networking can be just as important to your job search as writing a good resume and cover letter.  If you have a profile on LinkedIn, a disruptive checklist can help you keep track of different ways you can reach out to people who work at companies you might be interested in working for someday. 
 A checklist can also help remind you to keep these positive connections as you continue to build relationships with your peers and potential mentors. If you want to reach out for  an informational interview , our disruptive job search checklist can help you with that, too. Keep making these connections, and don't forget to keep in touch! 
 Your job search is crucial to building your career. Therefore, you need to make sure that you are on an effective and fruitful search mission.
