 December 27, 2020 
 Full Time 
 Copenhagen, DK 
 Remote 
 If you love making silly sounds that bring those extra laughs to the game üé§ü¶∂üçå - and you use Wwise and a bit of C# in close collaboration with designers to create synergy between the sound and design, so it isn't just added on top. 
 Then come join the team behind WHAT THE GOLF? and play with us on our upcoming next big project. üçåüê¥ 
 ‚Äç 
 ‚Äç 
 WHAT YOU WILL DO: Audio design, Wwise, and funny sounds  ‚Äç 
 As an Audio designer with a focus on jokes, you will be part of the team behind our unannounced new game. Your main responsibility will be adding audio to the game, but also figuring out how we can do more with audio and comedy. This happens in close collaboration with gameplay programmers and designers. 
 
 Own and design the in-game audio, direction, and processes around it, including the Wwise project 
 Organize foley recordings, use sound libraries and work with potential voice actors 
 Work closely with designers and programmers on how to make everything fit together 
 Explore ideas and come up with new smart things we hadn‚Äôt yet thought of 
 
 ‚Äç 
 WHAT YOU WILL ALSO DO: Help out and explore your own ideas  ‚Äç 
 Everyone has a main responsibility (this), but we also make time to explore other things. Maybe you are interested in playing with that new physics feature or try making that wacky level idea you came up with. We encourage people to learn new things and just help each other out across projects and teams. 
 REQUIREMENTS: 
 
 Experience in audio design, mixing, and editing 
 Proficiency with Wwise and enough Unity/C# experience to tie it together with the game 
 Good game understanding and can take part in design meetings 
 2+ years of experience and having shipped games 
 
 ** 
** 
 REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY JOB OPENING AT TRIBAND: 
 
 
 You thrive taking ownership of your own area. You can spot problems, ask for advice when in doubt, and implement your own solution 
 
 
 You actively support a culture of collaboration, mutual respect, inclusiveness, and creativity 
 
 
 A great working environment is important for you and you help out around you 
 
 
 Team production experience, such as using git, branching, stand-ups, sprints, reviews 
 
 
 ‚Äç 
 PRACTICALITIES: 
 
 37 hours work week with options for flexible schedules 
 No crunch: People over deadlines 
 Lunch included (also vegetarian/vegan options) 
 Paid parental leave 
 Competitive salary 
 
 ‚Äç 
 And a few notes on how we work: 
 
 We experiment a lot and it doesn‚Äôt always work out, but we always learn something 
 Everyone at the studio is hands-on and part of making things 
 You are part of defining and prioritizing your own tasks 
 You get to be part of shaping new projects and the studio 
 We explore and try to push the boundaries of what comedy can do in games 
 Working in 14-day sprints in close-knit teams of ~6 people from different skill areas  ‚Äç 
 
 ‚Äç 
 DEADLINE AND START:  ‚Äç 
 As soon as possible, but we will wait for the right candidate. 
 While we currently work remote and the job would start out fully remote, we will be returning to our office at some point, so you need to be in or up for coming to Copenhagen, Denmark. We can of course help with that.  ‚Äç 
 ‚Äç 
 WHAT THE TRIBAND?  ‚Äç 
 We want to make people laugh! We do it by making comedy games, being original, and taking chances. We recently launched WHAT THE GOLF? - a golf game for people who hate golf? 
 All jobs involve experiments, bad jokes, stupid ideas, silly physics, and failed prototypes. We work in Unity and almost everyone works in-editor and very hands-on, also if you do design, audio, or animation. 
 We are currently ~20 people of 6 different nationalities and the language is English. We put the people first and strive to create a great working environment and are generally looking for people who are not like us and who will challenge us and our way of doing things! 
 We believe that teams make games, not individuals - and we believe diversity makes for better teams. That's why we look for people who make the team better, instead of just who‚Äôs got the most experience. 
 We are primarily looking for people with at least 2+ years of game dev experience but will be opening up more entry-level positions in the future.

 ABOUT WHAT THE GOLF? 
 A silly physics-based golf parody where every golf course is a new surprising type of golf, some brilliant or hilarious, others so absurd they will make you go: WHAT THE GOLF?
