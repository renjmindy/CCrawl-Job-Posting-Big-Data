 Questions are the key to knowledge 
 What does a complete application look like? 
 Complete application documentation includes a covering letter, a curriculum vitae (cv) with a photo and references. For trainees, the last three school reports.  Important:  make sure you include full contact details, with e-mail address and telephone number 
 How does the application process work? 
 We start by making an initial selection in agreement with the specialist area in question, then follow up with first and second interviews. Our decision will then be based on that. 
 Will I be informed that my application has been received? 
 Yes, we send confirmation of receipt by e-mail. 
 How do I log onto the winkler jobs portal? 
 After you send in an application, you will receive an automatic e-mail from us with your personal access data for our  jobs portal  where you can view and manage your current applications. Please note that your user name does not automatically have to be your e-mail address. You can also register before you send in an application and select your user data yourself. 
 Can I withdraw an application? 
 Yes. In this case, please log on to our  jobs portal  using your access data, go to “Your applications” and click on “Withdraw”. 
 How long will it take to get a reply? 
 We do our best to process applications within 14 days, but it is important to us to check your application carefully, so individual cases may take a little longer. 
 Should I apply online or in writing? 
 Please apply online only, using the online application form you will find at the bottom of each job advertisement. This  contact form  is for speculative applications. 
 I'm interested in several jobs – do I need to submit several applications? 
 No, one application will be sufficient. In your covering letter, please mention the jobs which are of interest to you. 
 How do you deal with speculative applications? 
 We are pleased to receive speculative applications. It is helpful if you describe the activity which interests you in as much detail as possible. Otherwise, the same procedure applies to speculative applications as to ordinary ones. 
 What file formats and sizes can I send? 
 The ideal are Word or PDF documents, the attachments should be no more than 10 MB in total. 
 If I am rejected, will I be told why? 
 Like many other companies, we consider the assessment of an application to be a confidential internal process and so we are unable to provide information about the reasons for a rejection.
