 Farm work in Japan 
 **** NEWS:  Working Holiday Visas are being issued again since October 21, 2020 to all nationalities that can get the Working Holiday Visa and you can now travel to Japan! For our program participants, we can issue the required residence track (written pledge) for corona safety.  Read more... 
 Now you have the chance to  work and live on a Japanese farm, doing fully-remunerated farm work  as part of your Working Holiday in Japan! 
 For many Japanese, the quality and origin of their food is of high importance. At the same time, Japanese farmers are striving to produce agricultural produce of highest quality. So during your farm job in Japan you can learn a lot, have fun and at the same time enjoy a healthy nutrition! No previous knowledge about farming is needed. 
 The farms include small family-run farms where you would stay with the farmer's family, and also larger farms. 
 We will pre-arrange your farm job in Japan prior to your trip to Japan, which means you can start it right after your arrival to Japan (or if you prefer, you can also start your farm work at a later moment and be with us in Tokyo first). 
 Which will be my tasks at the farm? 
 Your tasks may include: 
 
 Working with horses, cows, chicken  : Feeding, clearing the dung out, cleaning machinery, milking, cleaning the animals, selling produce such as eggs, milk, icecream etc. 
 Planting  fruits and vegetables  (e.g. pumpkins, potatoes, lettuces, leeks, tomatoes, strawberries, peaches, melons), caring, harvesting, processing and possibly selling produce locally 
 Growing  cut flowers and ornamental plants 
 Seeding, growing and harvesting  crops  such as rice, millet, corn, wheat 
 
 What about the remuneration? 
 Farm jobs are remunerated at a range of 690-1500 Yen per hour. It is generally expected that you work for 48 hours (6 days x 8 hours) per week. 
 How is my accommodation? 
 The farms offer accommodation and meals. The costs for accommodation and meals are deducted from your salary, but to a far smaller amount than what you make through your work. You will still be able to keep some part of it! The exact kinds of accommodation and meal plans differ from farm to farm: 
 
 Directly with the  farmer's family  or at a separate  farm staff accommodation 
 Single room or dorm room  (typically tatami rooms where you would use a futon) 
 Either cooked  meals  are provided to you, or you would get raw ingredients such as vegetables and meat that you can prepare on your own 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 On which farms can I work? 
 We cooperate with farms all over Japan. You can let us know your preferences and we will try to find a farm for you. However, please understand that not all options are always available so you need to be flexible. You can let us know your preferences concerning: 
 
 When and for how long  you would like to do the farmwork (1 week to 1 year) 
 Where in Japan  : e.g. Hokkaidō (known for volcanoes and hot springs) and Tōhoku (known for mountains and skiing regions) in the North, Kantō incl. the urban fringe of Tokyo, Hokuriku, Tōkai and Shikoku in central Japans, as well as Kyūshū. 
 Type of farm  : With animal keeping or only cultivation of plants 
 Type of accommodation  : Farmer's family or staff house | single or dorm room | Whether or not cooked meals or food ingredience for self-catering are provided 
 
 Smaller farms are often family-run where you would be living with the farmer's family and where it is common that meals are provided to you. Some of these smaller farms are also visited by tourists ("Farmstay" - "Petting zoo"). 
 The larger farms often have employees living at a staff house where you would also be accommmodated and where it is common that you cook on your own or with the fellow staff. Some larger farms also have a staff canteen. At larger farms there are also often japanese (or sometimes foreign) students of agriculture doing an internship or writing their dissertation papers. 
 Who can join the program "Farm work in Japan"? 
 The requirements are: 
 
 You need to be able to get a  Working Holiday visa . This is only possible for citizens of the UK, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Canada, Germany, Austria, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Portugal, Spain, Hungary, Argentina, Chile, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Poland, Lithuania, Taiwan and Hong Kong aged 18-30 years (at the time of applying for the visa). 
 You need you have  Japanese language skills at conversational level  to be able to understand job instructions. If your level of Japanese is insuffient, you can first spend one month in Tokyo and attend intensive  Japanese language lessons . After one month, your level should be good enough for the farm work. 
 It is expected that you are  seriously interested in and motivated  to do the farm work. After a farm has confirmed a job to you and you have accepted it, you should not cancel the assignment for minor reasons, as the farmer is counting on you. It is furthermore expected that you can get up early, as the farm work, particularly when animals are involved, often has to start early in the morning. 
 
 Can I do farm work in Japan as part of my longer Working Holiday stay in Japan? 
 Of course! You will only get the Working Holiday visa once in a lifetime, so you should make use of it to the fullest! With the Working Holiday Visa you can stay for up to one year in Japan and accept fully remunerated jobs. If you book our Working Holiday package "Farm work in Japan", it includes all the support services of the  Working Holiday Package Tokyo . Prior to or after your farm work you can come to us in Tokyo and make use of our support services at no further cost.

 After around 3 days we present options of farms to you that are willing to hire you. You let us know your preferred option. 
 We will then let you know the date for a job interview with your farm of first choice. 
 Prior to the job interview we will give you some advice about and prepare you for it. The employer will at the end of the interview confirm to you whether you are hired or not. 
 In case you are not hired, we will arrange job interviews with your 2nd, 3rd choice etc. until you will have been accepted 
 The remaining instalment for the Working Holiday package "Farm work in Japan" is only due one month prior to your arrival. 
 
 Can I combine farm work with the ryokan jobs World Unite! is arranging? 
 This is also possible and we can make both arrangements prior to your arrival. In this case we will suggest to you options for farms AND ryokans around 3 days after you submit your CV/resume and we will arrange job interviews for you. An extra of 100 EUR will apply. 
 What happens if no farm accepts me? 
 In this unlikely event, we will refund your payments. 
 I'm already in Japan and hold a visa which allows me to do paid work. Can I book the farmwork only, without any further Working Holiday support services? 
 Yes, this is possible. For the arrangement of a farm job, without any further Working Holiday support, we would charge a one-time fee of 40,000 JPY (only applicable if you are already in Japan and rate applies if you are not a participant of our Tokyo Working Holiday program.
