 IHR Early Career Seminar 
 The History of Political Ideas Early Career seminar is based at the  Institute of Historical Research  in London and is held  every other Wednesday at 5:15pm  during term time, alternating with  the main History of Political Ideas seminar series . The committee meets at the end of every academic year to plan the next series of seminars. Interested speakers should get in touch with us by this time using the contact form on this website. Please note that our speakers are final-year PhD students, post-docs and early career researchers (within five years from the award of their doctorate). The seminar enjoys regular attendance from MA and PhD students, permanent members of staff, and independent researchers. Speakers and attendees can look forward to a collegial and constructive discussion of the papers presented, and all are welcome to drinks and dinner after the seminar. Please click  here  for the  seminar schedule  , and you may wish to follow the  Twitter account  of the  QMUL Centre for the Study of the History of Political Thought  for weekly reminders of both seminars.
