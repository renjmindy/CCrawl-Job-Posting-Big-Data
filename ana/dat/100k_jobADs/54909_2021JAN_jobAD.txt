 BVK - Advertising Agency 
 Sr. Account Executive 
 After my work in radio, I was extremely excited to begin working at an advertising agency. Working on the account side is what really sparked my skill to communicate and learn to speak to different audiences. Not only with my clients DeVry University, Keller Graduate School of Management and Funjet Vacations, but not only internally between art directors and media buyers but also with clients. 
 My time working on the DeVry account was when we worked and focused on individual markets. Assigned to me were 3 district managers, and 14 markets. (CA, TX & MN). This is where I learned the importance of regionally targeting and how important it is to understand your demographic. Each year we set the media plans for the different regions aligned with their specific needs in the market. This is where I learned about media planning, timing and budgeting. I was able to gain experience on what type of mediums worked from promotions to print ads. This started my love for Gantt charts.
