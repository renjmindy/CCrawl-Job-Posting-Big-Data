 High School Career Day Left A Lot To Be Desired 
 Posted on  March 27, 2012  |  4 Comments 
 Good morning Everyone! 
 I find it is easier sometimes to access WordPress through Google Chrome, and as I was getting ready to sign in this morning, I looked at the latest product from the Google Doodlers, and realized that "Google Doodler" was not on the list of possible careers when I attended career day during high school. 
 Of course, neither Google, nor personal computers were invented when I graduated from high school, which might explain the absence. However, other exciting career choices didn't make the list, either. 
 
 Sunset over Key West 
 One example is travel show host. If they had told me in high school that I could travel to lots of exotic and exciting places, take cruises, make regular trips to Disney World, tell people about it on TV and get paid for it, my career choices might have been very different. 
 I would have liked to know more about jobs like "Alaskan State Trooper." I probably wouldn't have taken that route, but the show is pretty fascinating. My husband wishes that he had known about jobs such as Alaskan bush pilot (I think that's the right phrase). He probably would have taken any job that allowed him to fly for a living in a sea plane between small towns, even if it meant living in the Arctic. (And given the way Mark hates cold, that's saying something!) If he had known you could do it in tropical islands and make a living, we would be living somewhere like Tahiti now. 
 
 From Print Shop Professional 2.o 
 RV park inspector is another job that didn't make the list. As near as I can fathom the requirements of this job, an RV park inspector rides from RV park to RV park in some type of recreational vehicle, either a motor home or a trailer, and rates the park on given specifications either for the campground chain's purposes or for publication in a campground guide. We would be quite good at that. 
 Working at a local marina might be fun (I have to confess I didn't know what a marina was until after high school; I knew what a port was, but didn't have a conception of a marina - the casualty of a Navy family life geared to the ocean). 
 
 I did flirt with the idea of marine biologist, available on career day, but let the idea slide due to the fact that I didn't think I could pay for graduate school (but then Mark and I ended up paying for me to go to law school at night! Go figure.) 
 
 Writing has always been high on my list, and "writer" was a possible career discussed on career day, but the descriptions always included terms equivalent to "starving artist" which placed the job at a decided disadvantage. It took me seven years after graduating law school to realize that I was writing for a living - granted, I was writing briefs for judges and lawyers to read, but I was writing. "Starving artist" is not a term associated with what I do. I also get to write this blog, which helps to stave off, even if it doesn't completely satisfy, the creative writing urge in me. I couldn't make a living with the blog, but I certainly do enjoy writing it. 
 
 "Artist" wasn't even a remote possibility, as I had no idea until two years ago that I had any modicum of artistic talent whatever. 
 There is always a bright side, of course, even to notable gaps in career day in high school and career choices by adults. In my case, it is all the possibilities left for me as I decide what I want to be when I grow up! At this rate, I expect I will be fully grown up when I reach the age of, oh, 90 or so. 
 Have a great day everyone! 
 Nancy 
 P.S. Thank all of you for your kind words and prayers regarding the death of my grandfather. I appreciate them.

 Was that sunset at Mallory Square? I was there last week and have several pictures from there. I didn't get up early enough to take pictures of the sunrise.

 No, that was sunset somewhere between Stock Island and Key West on the kayaking trip we took while we were done there last year. I"m glad you got to go, too! It's a wonderful place to visit.

 This was one of your best Nancy! I love the theme and the examples you use. A real pleasure to read. 
 P.S. Tall person said that he wished he had known about the crab fishermen in the Bering Sea. 30 years ago he might have signed up! ðŸ™‚

 Thanks Bassa! I gather the tall person does not find cold and wet too very upsetting if he would have signed up to be a crab fisherman in the Bering Strait!
