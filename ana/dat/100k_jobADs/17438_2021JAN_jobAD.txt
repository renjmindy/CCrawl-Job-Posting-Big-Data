 employment tag ,  jobs i wouldn't do 
 when i was 23, a few years ago, an ancient mentor suggested that i begin to think about a real career; fine art being an impractical occupation unless one had the right 'connections'. 
 so i went to an 'automat', "horn and hardarts", where you could put a nickle in and get a cup of coffee and a donut and think. i made a list of all the jobs that people did in those days (about 30), and one by one i crossed them out for whatever reason. 
 finally, only one was left and that was architect. 
 since i had left school when i was thirteen to go 'on the road' and draw and paint my way around the country, which i did for ten years. i had no formal schooling at all since the eighth grade, so i enrolled in night highschool (four hours a day, five days a week. it was a full load of six subjects per semester}. by the way, during that time i worked as a manniken maker, a bicycle errand boy, a maitre d' hotel at a fancy eastside restaurant (martells, the same family restaurant in france which also produced the famous "martells" brandy.), as a draughtsman at 'accurate tool and die', accountant at the world famous 'tiffany's' on fifth ave. and fifty-seventh street. and finally a year and a half in the 'systems' dept. at 'continental can co.', a giant packaging corporation (and it was a 'suit and tie' sinecure i got because of the fact that my father's classmate at 'northwestern university was the vice-president in charge of 'personnel}. 
 i got "A+'s in most of my classes and eventually entered columbia university on a scholarship as a day student. i didn't achieve my aim to be an architect, but i did become an art director. 
 all of this was just to comply with  isabel's  tag, i wrote associatively, on this subject. 
 now here are the rules of izzy's tag: 
 So the rules will be the following: 
-Name 5 jobs / professions what you would never ever do / practice with explanation 
-Refer back to the person / ppl who tagged you 
â€“Name 5 victims - also make a link to their blog! 
 izzy used five i would have chosen, but here goesâ€¦ 
 i wouldn't be a toll-taker on the highway cooped up in a small box for eight hours, no matter what the benefits after 30 years (and the watch), or the government salary. 
 i couldn't be a garbage man and have my kids have to tell their friends that their father was a 'sanitary engineer'. 
 i tried working as an inhalation therapist at mt. sinnai hospital in new york city but i left after two weeks because i am 'squeamish' and when a ninety year old lady who couldn't speak even began to cry silent tears when i inserted her catheter, i cried too; and left. 
 i wouldn't teach college students because they mostly have nothing but contempt for anyone over 30. 
 i couldn't be a politician (even though i was elected to be president of the student body of grade school (last year of grade schoolâ€¦ sixth grade)(and that was just because of the machinations of my older brother who was editor of the school paper and graduating to jr. high) 
i couldn't be a politician because when i lie, my tongue burns worse than a true mexican plate of fiery enchiladas. 
 now i choose five people who i know would, if they cared to try, write either a witty tag response or at least an informative oneâ€¦ i guess this is how we get to know each other better. isn't that the reasson behind all these taggings? 
 they are: 
 lokutus prime 
 noahcounte 
 jilleebean 
 imtheoldmannow 
 culturesurfer 
 belowâ€¦ self-portrait as a dragon. 
 have fun my friendsâ€¦ really. it can be fun.

 hi lois,yes, someday i will publish 'the book', i only covered a period of three years. even then i left out a coupleâ€¦ machine operator for vinyl records for the american foundation for the blind and salesman for a skrink wrap packaging firm. ohhh and i picked apples twelve hours a day,from seven to seven, seven days in a row for four weeks in maineâ€¦ got me back to the city just in time to cram and catch up with the semester's assignments. that was nothing but hard work picking 165 bushels a day with a half hour lunch. but i loved it. and was i in good shape.(at dinner time in the 'bunkhouse' we were used to eating a whole broiled chicken apiece with all the side dishes you might find in thomas wolf's "look homeward angel". breakfast was gigantic also, with mountains of bacon and sausages bisquits and gravy, about four eggs scrambled and a bowl of oatmeal. we passed out at nine and rose with the sun.)

 Hi Scott!! Everyone I tagged, and they weren't on your list, was already tagged for the same subject. After many attempts, I finally (I think..hehe) found 5 who were not!!I understand about occupations not leading us down the road to financial or at least, enough to get by, success. Been there!A variety of jobs you held, but your natural talent, your one and only love, will never be a job. Our dreams can never be. But, when we make our dreams come true, all seems to blend beautifully onto the foundation we've so carefully and proudly, built!!!The love for your 'work' shows in all you do, Scott! Awesome!Hugsâ€¦Jillee:love:

 i guess all in all we are lucky that we don't have some of the jobs that this tag has brought to mind.yep, it takes a special kind of maybe, even objectivity, to be a politician. it's the motive to want to be in control that is specious.yes, chinajon, if you say soâ€¦ my animal is bear. i was just messing around. i'll post some of these dragons i drew two weeks ago. one day i drew 14 different dragons.
