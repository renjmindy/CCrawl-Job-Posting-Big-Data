 Look At This! it's a Freelance job 
 Studio Institute is looking for a Freelance Integrated Project Manager in New York, NY, USA. Not an ordinary Freelance Integrated Project Manager but the kind of Freelance Integrated Project Manager that makes other Freelance Integrated Project Managers question their Freelance Integrated Project Manager-ness. 
 About 
 Studio Institute we build brands and brand experiences of the future. We pride ourselves on partnering with founders and brands who focus on doing good work that does good. 
 We are searching for a highly organized and thoughtful Project Manager to join our team as a freelancer on an exciting upcoming project. 
 You are: 
 A fantastic planner, manager, and problem solver who has a high level of confidence in working alongside our client, and strategy, creative, and production teams to ensure all deliverables are 
on time, and on-budget. 
 You have experience in the start-up space, preferably managing a direct-to-consumer or product-driven creative project from start to finish. 
 You’re motivated by a fast-paced, collaborative environment and have the organizational skills to push work forward in a timely manner. 
 You’re comfortable with project planning and driving scoping conversations and have excellent communication skills- from start to finish, colleagues and clients alike rely on you to turn ideas into tangible assets. 
 Tech-Specs: 
 You have 3-5 years of experience in project management alongside clients and creative teams. 
You have experience and are capable of working across a multitude of projects from Strategy, Marketing, Visual Identity, and Digital. 
 About Us: 
 We are a small group of creatives who thrive on telling stories and building brands that solve unique challenges through communication. In more ways than one, we are like our founders - excited self-starters who are eager to build the brands of tomorrow and do so with grace, empathy, and honesty. 
 This freelance opportunity is location-flexible, however, NYC is preferred.
