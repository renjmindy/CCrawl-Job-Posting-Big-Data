 Becoming Steve Jobs 
 
 Becoming Steve Jobs: The Evolution of a Reckless Upstart into a Visionary Leader by Brent Schlender and Rick Tetzeli (Crown Business, $30.00, 464 pages) 
 " You cannot connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward." Steve Jobs 
 Schlender and Tetzeli Connect the Dots 
 "This is the West, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend." These words from Maxwell Scott seemed to have come to life in Walter Isaacson's earlier-released biography of Steve Jobs. Isaacson's version of Jobs' story relied on commonly stated "facts" about Jobs, which have become the stuff of legend. And these facts strongly emphasized the less desirable aspects of Jobs' personality and aggressive leadership style. 
 This new bio by Brent Schendler and Rick Tetzeli presents a kinder, gentler account of the man who co-founded and led Apple Computer; it seeks to get past "The cliche that Steve Jobs was half genius, half a-hole." And it largely succeeds by emphasizing that any shortcomings on Jobs' part were due to his dedication to Apple Computer: "He put the needs of the company ahead of any (personal or) work relationship." That dedication produced the most successful technology company in the world. (It may also have led Jobs to delay cancer surgery that might have spared his life. When he later had the surgery, he was given only a "50-50" chance of living for five years; he survived for seven post-surgery years.) 
 This excellent account allows one to get to know Jobs as a living, breathing human being - an imperfect, fully goal-oriented man full of "deep restlessness."  Becoming Steve Jobs  is such an effective telling of Jobs' life story that at the conclusion of the book the reader will grieve his death - the world's loss, all over again. 
 Highly recommended .
