 Changing Jobs - Leaving the Comfort Zone and how a job coach can help 
 
 There are many reason why we need to change jobs, a dislike, redundancy, ill health or just a need to take ourselves out of our comfort zone. We like familiar things, we enjoy being surrounded with people we feel at ease with; we like our 10.30 cup of coffee and we like our surroundings, after all it is important that you wake up in the morning wanting to go to work. Whatever the reason if you want to progress you know it is time for a change, so what is stopping you? 
 It may be a long time since you have been in the jobs market, and although you promised yourself to keep your CV up to date it probably needs a good overhaul to make it more current and truly reflect your most up to date skills. Most of us use social media these days and many recruiters will check out your online activities, would yours be update, or maybe you don't have a social media presence at all. Then there’s thoughts of attending an interview, maybe you haven't done that for some time or since leaving school! For those who suddenly find themselves in this situation through redundancy it can be quite frightening, and for those stepping outside their comfort zone it is a daunting prospect, but what of the opportunities you may be missing. 
 A fresh challenge, meeting new people, reminding yourself of what you are good at, personal development and reward has a real feel good factor. So how can using a job coach help? We understand how terrifying it can be to leave a job, some people jump without a plan in place, but a more strategic approach would give you a revitalized sense of purpose. Using a job coaching service will provide you with a good source of help, confidence, inspiration, and feedback and can help you to present yourself in the best way possible to help you secure that job. A job coach can help you identify gaps, overview you’re CV, help with mock interview techniques, focus on social media and more…. 
 So when it comes to getting outside your comfort zone think about putting a solid plan in place, this will renew your confidence, highlight all those things you are good at and have probably forgotten and help you to present yourself in the best possible way . This will help you to adapt to the market place and help you to secure that all important new job.
