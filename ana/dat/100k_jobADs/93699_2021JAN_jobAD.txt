  Wanted: Night Time Job That Suits My College Degree  
 Work It Daily 
 May 19, 2009 
 Deer Experts, I have struggled for years to get a mainstream job, finally taking a job 3PM to midnight. I hate the job, but I love the hours. My sleep schedule has never been better. Now I want to look for a job that will better suit my Cultural Studies Bachelors degree, but has night time hours. The only problem is, Career Builder, Monster, and Indeed don't list jobs by the hours they work. How do I find a job in Huntsville Alabama that goes at night? Am I looking for a needle in a haystack? How do I help myself?  Our Twitter Advice Project (T.A.P.) is no longer an active campaign. To find an answer to the above question, please use the "Search" box in the right-hand column of this website.
