 By  Admin  June 21, 2019 November 21st, 2019   No Comments 
 Who doesn’t want a dream job with a handsome salary? I guess we all do. But, then we ask ourselves we are not qualified enough for the dream job. Well, now you can have your dream job. Now, you will ask, how. The simple solution to this problem is “Online Courses”. There is a number of courses available on various subjects and trade. Some of them are paid but some of them are available free. All you need an Internet connection and a laptop or personal computer. 
 What are Online Courses or eLearning? 
 According to elearningnc.gov, “eLearning is learning to utilize electronic technologies to access educational curriculum outside of a traditional classroom. In most cases, it refers to a course, program or degree delivered completely online.” 
 Online Courses Can Shape Your Career? 
 Let’s face it the skills you have right now will be outdated and we are well aware of the fierce completion going on for good jobs. Let’s check out, the ways through which you can shape your career. 
 Update Yourself (Always) 
 We can always update and up-skill ourselves and can acquire more and more knowledge. For example, if you are a web developer and working perfectly fine in a company but you lack a few skills such as command over communication skills. But if you are sure to make a change then you can take help from online courses. Like the way Vantage Circle, co-founder of Partha Neog said, “While there are numerous professional courses to learn new skills, it is also a good idea to develop skills which may not be strictly relevant to the current job.”
