 I am currently working with an nationwide business that are part of a larger group in fast paced FMCG and Retail who are looking for a Commercial Finance Manager to join their team in their Birmingham office to head up the finance team responsible for Management Accounts and patterning with the wider business. 
 This is a genuinely exciting opportunity for someone seeking the next step in their career. With a strong customer base, you will be responsible for internal and external stakeholder management, along with monitoring efficiency and reconciling and monitoring stock and contracts within the division, alongside reporting to group. 
 The company is looking for a strong personality and career climber to be the lynch pin in communications with group. 
 The position will be heavily focused on Business Partnering with other divisions of the group and working in a heavily commercial environment. The successful candidate will need strong technical ability along with solid relationship building skills. 
 This position will be focused around both the day-to-day financial operations, but also much larger company projects. You will ideally be ACCA, ACA or CIMA qualified and have the gravitas to implement change and nurture and develop relationships internally as well as externally. 
 For the successful Assistant Financial Controller, they are looking to pay between £50,000 to £55,000 DOE.
