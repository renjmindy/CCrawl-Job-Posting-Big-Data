 More about this opening 
 Working on the Showcase application gives me the opportunity to create features that even the biggest of banks have yet to implement, which makes me feel like I’m working half a decade in the future. Seeing the hard work displayed on the big screen during the keynote of the annual Connect conference was truly the icing on the cake. 
 George Coleman iOS Engineer, EMEA Hub 
 It really makes me feel happy being part of a team that's building high quality web and mobile applications for the very complex world of Banking industry. Besides, your ideas and initiatives are heard and considered by your team colleagues. 
 Alejandro Aguirre Luna Senior Backend Engineer, EMEA Hub 
 The most exciting thing about working at Backbase is the multicultural environment, very zealous co-workers, freedom to challenge yourself. The key essence of working at Backbase is the constant strive to make it happen, gather all the pieces of the puzzle and make a beautiful picture out of it and that is what I love most about working at Backbase.
