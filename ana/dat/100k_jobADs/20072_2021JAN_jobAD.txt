 Meet Shannon, occupational safety officer 
 
 Meet Shannon, occupational safety officer 
 Published on: November 27, 2020 
 A career with a difference 
 At WorkSafeBC, we care about our employees and encourage ongoing development through in-house training that’s focused on strengthening professional and personal skills, and supporting mental well-being. 
 As a new occupational safety officer, Shannon learned first-hand about the importance of having the support of her peers and fellow officers. In her role, Shannon helps make workplaces safer by ensuring employers and workers understand and comply with B.C.'s Occupational Health and Safety Regulation. Her day-to-day duties and responsibilities include promoting a culture of health and safety and educating workers and employers on injury prevention. 
 "When I first started at WorkSafeBC, I spent the first three months in my region and had the opportunity to meet and get to know my fellow officers. My supervisor emphasized the importance of interacting with the team and I immediately understood that the organization truly recognizes that their greatest resource is their people. We all bring diverse backgrounds, education, and experiences to the organization, and it makes our teams stronger." 
 In addition to the collaborative culture, Shannon was impressed with the mentorship and support programs available to staff. 
 One program in particular, the Peer Support Program, stuck out to Shannon. The program gives officers the opportunity to confidentially connect with a trained peer support worker following a difficult or distressing workplace event. It allows our officers to have an open dialogue with their colleagues, and ultimately serves as an outlet for staff to share their feelings and experiences. 
 "I felt an immediate connection with the program and wanted to get involved as a prevention officer," she says. "If I can be a sounding board for people who are experiencing stress, it's something I am proud to do." 
 This kind of peer support helps our staff manage health and safety concerns in real-time, and provides a greater understanding of the effects of stress and how to make it more manageable for our officers. "As an employee, WorkSafeBC has your back in more ways than one," she explains. 
 As one of B.C.'s top employers in 2020, our team is proud to live our values of integrity, service, accountability, innovation, partnership and collaboration - and we look for employees who do the same.
