 Millar Western closes its lumber mill in Boyle, Alta., 91 workers to lose jobs 
 November 20, 2015 
 By: Canadian Business 
 Millar Western says it is closing its Boyle lumber mill in northern Alberta indefinitely. 
 The Edmonton-based company says softwood market conditions make it uneconomical to continue operating. 
 The plant is to begin a phased shutdown starting next month be completed in February. 
 Millar Western says the 91 workers who are to lose their jobs will be offered severance and other support. 
 The family-owned company says its Whitecourt and Fox Creek operations will continue to operate at full capacity. 
 Boyle is a village about 160 kilometres north of Edmonton. 
 “We recognize the impact this closure will have on our people, whose dedicated service has been very highly valued, as well as on our contractors, suppliers and the community of Boyle, whose support over the years has been greatly appreciated,” Millar Western president Craig Armstrong said Thursday. 
 The company purchased the Boyle operation in 1993 and reopened it the following year after extensive upgrading, including installing a new sawmill.
