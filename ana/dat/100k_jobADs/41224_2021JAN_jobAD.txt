  3 Tools To Escape Your Miserable Job  
 Ryan Niessen 
 March 09, 2015 
 Ever feel like you’re stuck in an Alcatraz movie?  Related:   The Secret To Discovering Your Dream Job  All you do is sit in your cell and think about how to get out… But you know that there’s no point even trying to escape... because you’d still have to swim 2.4km through the strong currents and swirling waters of the San Francisco bay before you hit land. What if I told you that there is a way out… That  you CAN   escape your miserable job , and do something that: 
 
 
 You love... 
 Pays well 
 Aligns with your strengths, values, and passions, and… 
 Makes a positive difference in the world 
 
 The key is to do the exact opposite of everyone else. With that in mind, here are… 
 3 Tools To Escape Your Miserable Job 
 Tool #1: Look In The Right Place 
 Q: Where do most people look to find a job they love? A: The big job seeking sites. All you have to do is enter in your location and job title, and your dream job appears! Except that’s not how it  really  works, is it? You have to compete with everyone else doing the exact same thing. Then, if you get the job you feel like the luckiest person in the world. Until about two weeks later when you’re fed up with it again, and feel worse than you did at your last job.  Here’s what you do instead:  Go  against  the grain, and  seek out 3-5 companies that inspire you.  You can start with this  resource guide , which shares 14 job sites and thousands of opportunities with inspiring, purpose-driven companies. Because they’re “purpose-driven,” they choose to make a profit AND a difference, and many of them value empowering and engaging their employees. Take Zappos, for instance. They have wellness coaches, laser-tag parties, and even a nap room for employees! 
 Tool #2: Get Clear on What You Want 
 It’s a simple fact: Your results in life are a result of your thoughts, choices, and beliefs. So if your way of seeing the world tells you that your dream job is going to drop into your lap one day… That you just need to suffer a few more years and then it’ll come to you… Or even that you don’t deserve it… Then you’re in trouble. You see,  the  fastest  way to escape your crummy job and do something you love is to get clear on what you want, and then go get it.  It’ll take some time, and you’ll fall along the way… but it’s better than sitting and waiting for it to appear. Don’t believe me? Study any successful person in the world, and you’ll see that they got there because they knew what they wanted, and they made it happen. 
 Tool #3: New School Job Seeking Strategies 
 You know this… traditional job seeking approaches just don’t work anymore. People have seen the same boring resume and cover letter over and over, and they want something fresh. So do something different. Stand out. YouTube cover letters, attention-grabbing physical packages with a pitch inside, and even creating a simple website for each specific job application shows that you’re willing to go above and beyond to get what you want.  It’s the new way of getting your dream job, and it works.  For some more great ideas on how to get an inspiring company’s attention, here are  7 Online Tools That Trump Your Traditional Resume.  Plus, I’ve put together a  short video here  with the founder of an entire list of purpose-driven organizations. There are three solid job seeking tips in there, and more insight into this modern-day movement of game-changing companies. Happy job seeking!
