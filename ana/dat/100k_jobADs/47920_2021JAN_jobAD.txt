 Decent Jobs For Youth 
 In October 2014, the United Nations High-Level Committee on Programmes selected youth employment as a prototype for an issue-based initiative that would mobilize the capacity of the United Nations and global actors committed to more and better jobs for youth. 
 Positive collaboration of numerous United Nations entities led to the development of the Global Initiative on Decent Jobs for Youth, which was endorsed by the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination and subsequently launched by the Director-General of the International Labour Organization (ILO) in February 2016, under the auspices of the ECOSOC Youth Forum. Under ILO lead, the following entities of the United Nations work collaboratively since 2015 to develop the strategy of the Global Initiative on Decent Jobs for Youth and lay the groundwork for its implementation. 
 Decent Jobs for Youth is the global initiative to scale up action and impact on youth employment in support of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This platform is a hub for catalyzing partnerships, collaboration and coordinated action grounded in evidence-based strategies. The vision is a world in which young women and men everywhere have greater access to decent jobs. 
 The youth employment challenge is enormous. But it is not insurmountable. We have a vision of a world where young women and men everywhere can earn a fair income while working in conditions of security, dignity and equality. Getting young people into decent jobs is not just essential for their future, but for the future of our local communities, our countries and our global society. Decent jobs for youth are also essential to realizing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 
 Investing in youth employment requires a collaborative approach to prioritizing job creation while helping youth to overcome specific disadvantages, such as skills mismatch and discrimination.
