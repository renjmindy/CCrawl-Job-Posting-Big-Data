 __   Introduction to Your Course Mentor - Brian Clapp 
 Hi, I'm Brian Clapp, Director of Content for WorkinSports.com, host of the Work in Sports podcast and 20+ year veteran of the sports industry. 
 I began my career in the sports broadcast media at CNN/Sports Illustrated as a Production Assistant. After seven years with CNN/SI, and advancing to the role of Producer, I relocated to Seattle to be the News Director at Fox Sports Northwest (Now: Root Sports). 
 For the last seven years, I have been a part of the WorkinSports.com team, developing content that helps individuals like you break down the door of the sports industry. 
 In my 20 years in sports, I have been a content creator both in broadcast and digital, managed and hired staff, executed a multi-million dollar production budget and interviewed hundreds of sports executives about their hiring practices and careers 
 The advice I share in the coming modules is developed not only from my personal experience, but from interviewing experts like Mailynh Vu, Cleveland Indians Assistant Director of Talent Acquisition, Brian Killingsworth, Vegas Golden Knights CMO, Dior Ginyard NFLPA Senior Player Manager and Emily Jaenson General Manager of the Reno Aces - to name just a few. 
 My guests on the Work in Sports podcast provide current information regarding what they need and want from the people they hire and so much of their advice is included in these modules. 
 Sharing my insight with all of you drives me. I want to see passionate, engaged people succeed in the sports industry. That's why I am here. 
 Let's get to work.
