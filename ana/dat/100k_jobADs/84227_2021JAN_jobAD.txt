 About DeansList 
 DeansList is the daily driver app that runs great K12 schools all over the U.S. We make it easy for schools to keep track of the data that matters,, distribute it across the school to all stakeholders, and communicate more frequently and more effectively with families. 
 We focus specifically on the needs of students and families in underserved communities. Our feature set is designed to improve opportunities for students most affected by the achievement gap, areas like chronic absenteeism, family engagement, and social emotional skills. 
 Our clients are innovative schools, mission-driven to closing the Achievement Gap, and DeansList is a key tool enabling them help students succeed. 
 About the role 
 At DeansList, we give educators the tools to collect data efficiently and use it effectively. We believe that access to data helps educators make informed decisions about how best to support students and that regularly providing families with information about student performance and progress opens lines of communication and builds trust.
