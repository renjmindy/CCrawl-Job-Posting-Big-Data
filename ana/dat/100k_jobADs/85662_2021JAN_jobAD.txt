 #Commission based only - remote role# 
 We are a start-up, focused on creating innovative and engaging applications, websites and platforms. We are currently working with amazing start-ups and few corporates. 
 We deliver the best that development has to offer (framework NextJS based on ReactJS/library ESLint/Storybook/library Ant Design/Redux). Our culture is high-energy and our approach is deeply customer-obsessed. 
 Our values place great emphasis upon open communication, autonomy and empowerment. We believe in encouraging people to be the best they can be and giving them the tools to achieve their goals. 
 We would like to invite all demographics of culture, gender, ethnicity, neuro-diversity and beyond because we believe a representative team makes better things and provides a better working life. 
 We look forward to hearing how you can help us to be better. 
 Two simple questions: 
 
 Are you ready to generate some clients for us? 
 When do we start?
