 Fondecyt Postdoctoral Program 2021 
 The Philosophy Institute, Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, invites early career scholars (that have received their PhD no earlier than 2017, and no earlier than 2016 for female researchers that had children since 2016) to apply to the Fondecyt Postdoctoral Program 2021, funded by the Chilean government. Postdoctoral research projects can last two or three years. The grant includes a monthly salary of about 2300 USD, and funding for attending conferences. The grant is highly competitive, so applications must be as strong as possible. Philosophers of science and philosophers of physics interested in applying, please contact Pablo Acuña (ptacuna@uc.cl).

 Postdoc: LARSIM, Paris-Saclay 
 LARSIM group at CEA-Saclay will hire a postdoctoral researcher to work with Dr. Alexei Grinbaum in the foundations of quantum mechanics and quantum information. Topics of interest may include, but aren’t limited to, non-classical resource theories, indefinite causal orders, or quantum and generalized contextuality. While this research is expected to be of theoretical and mathematical nature, professional contact with experimental groups inside and outside CEA will be appreciated. Collaborations in Paris area may include Paris Center for Quantum Computing, ENS Paris-Saclay, or INRIA.

 Postdoc in philosophy of physics 
 The research unit "The Epistemology of the LHC", established by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the Austrian Science Fund (FWF), invites applications for 
 a Postdoctoral position 
in the field of philosophy of physics. 
 Established in 2016, the Research Unit has forged a unique cooperation between physicists, philosophers, historians, and social scientists. Its aim is to collectively investigate the epistemology of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. With its six individual projects cooperating closely and its teams located at universities across Germany and Austria, the Research Unit covers a broad variety of issues concerning the forefront of research on experimental and theoretical physics at one of the largest scientific facilities worldwide. It addresses key questions in philosophy, history, and the social sciences from an interdisciplinary perspective.
