 Hotel and Restaurant Management: a global career 
 1 Reply 
 The hospitality industry is a major component of Southern Arizona’s economy and, as a recent Arizona Daily Star  story  informed us, is poised to grow. 
 This is why I was pleased to read about our top-quality  Hotel and Restaurant Management  (HRM) program in the Sept. 5 edition of  Inside Tucson Business . The article notes that we have dedicated space in our new Northwest Campus building to HRM. In the new space we have two classrooms that each accommodates over 25 students who get real-life training at the space’s hotel front desk, bathroom and bedroom. 
 PCC offers certificate and associate degree programs in HRM. Through a partnership with Northern Arizona University, our students also can transfer and complete a bachelor’s degree at Northern Arizona University 
 As lead faculty member Armando Trujillo notes in the story, the hospitality sector offers opportunities for employment around the U.S. and around the world. Through our program, we offer students a chance to embark on a truly global career.
