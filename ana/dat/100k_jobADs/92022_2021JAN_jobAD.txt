 Senior Web Developer - Craft CMS REMOTEPERMANENT 
 Job Description 
 Job Description 
 Paper Tiger is a team of remote and on-location people that design and build effective websites. We're on the lookout for a full-time Senior Developer to lead our development department. 
 Is this you? 
You've been building websites for years, and you're comfortable being knee-deep in ES6 and webpack—as well as architecting an API in PHP for a client. 
 You're a great communicator that knows how to balance a deadline with the desire to produce great quality work, and you're alright talking directly with clients about their projects. 
 You're okay with working from home, and you're capable of managing your own time and schedule to make sure projects are on-track. Since we're a small shop, you'll have lots of autonomy to "get things done" in any way you wish—all that's required on our end is consistent communication about barriers and a successfully-shipped project! 
 The Role 
You'll be working primarily with Craft CMS, WordPress, and Shopify. Most projects that don't involve Craft or WordPress are handled by our design team, who has extensive frontend development experience. However, you may need to lend them a hand for backend integrations or customizations in various systems. 
 The role requires someone with at least mid-level experience in both front and backend, since you'll be building & managing both sides of projects. 
 Since we're a smaller shop, we always have a variety of projects and clients—so there's always something new and different to build!
