 Is Career Development Optional? 
 Is Career Development Optional? 
 __ 10th December 2020 10th December 2020 
 It’s a little known fact that we hire employees who are ready to hit the ground running with no training—at least that is the hope. Most employees are thrown into a new job position with the assumption and expectation that they will just  catch on  and  develop  as they go  .  With this lack of attention in companies for training, do you think this will keep employees, or fuel the fire to help them out the door?  Employers are the one’s initiating and lighting the match.  Everyone needs training, and everyone needs development.  Human Resource Management , in their article on why managers are always on the prowl for a new job, stated, 
 “  Dissatisfaction with some employee-development efforts appears to fuel many early exits. We asked young managers what their employers do to help them grow in their jobs and what they’d  like  their employers to do, and found some large gaps. Workers reported that companies generally satisfy their needs for on-the-job development and that they value these   opportunities, which include high-visibility positions and significant increases in responsibility. But they’re not getting much in the way of formal development, such as training, mentoring and coaching – things they also value highly .” 
 Most all employees desire to develop out of one career into another—and many would love to stay at the same company where they are currently serving. As an employer, you want people like this. People who are willing to stay along for the ride and make the path better for others who will come on staff.  It’s time to stop, look at your talent, and take the time to train them to their highest potential.  Blazing through new hires because your current talent continues to walk out the door can hurt your reputation, business plans, and budgets. From the time a hire begins to when they are called elsewhere—it’s your job and priority that they are constantly growing and becoming more skilled. It’s a lot on the shoulders of a manager—but someone must have done this for you, and now it’s time to return the favor for your company. Don’t let your good employees walk out because they have become idle in their skills and job duties. You’ve got the resources to keep them interested and growing as a businessman or woman.
