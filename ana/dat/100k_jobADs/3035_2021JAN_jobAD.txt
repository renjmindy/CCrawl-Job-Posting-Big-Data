 Ottawa Hospital Research Institute 
 __Ottawa, ON

 PhD student positions are available in the laboratory of Dr. Xiaohui Zha at Ottawa Hospital Research Institute/University of Ottawa, Canada (http://www.ohri.ca/profile/Zha). 
 The main project is to study the mechanisms by which cholesterol regulates macrophage inflammation, a key event in atherosclerosis. Cholesterol, a major component of the plasma membrane in mammalian cells, predominantly regulates membrane physical properties. Through its modulation of cellular membranes, cholesterol impacts numerous signal transduction pathways and cellular processes. Particularly, cholesterol levels in macrophages determine the nature of the inflammation response, for example, pro- inflammatory response (M1), anti-inflammatory (M2) or anything in between. The mechanism is largely unknown. In recent years, it is increasingly apparent that macrophages can respond to environmental cues to establish an epigenetically poised state. This allows macrophages to rapidly launch a large-scale gene expression program upon stimulation (i.e. LPS). The project will use biochemistry and genomic techniques, such as RNA-sequencing and ChIP-sequencing, to understand how cholesterol establishes epigenetically poised states in the genome of the macrophages to regulate gene expression for inflammatory responses. 
 Candidates should be recent graduated undergraduates in physical science or biological science. Knowledge/experience in genomic system biology is a plus, but not necessary. If interested, please send curriculum vitae and brief statement of research interest.
