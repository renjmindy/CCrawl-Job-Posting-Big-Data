 Case Keenum Pure ARE Score

 As a starter, Keenum has been shaky, but last season his efficiency and poise made a positive uptick. The Broncos provide some of the same environment that cultivated Keenum's success last year: a solid wide receiving core and a stout defense. He is in a good position to put up numbers, despite some questions regarding the backfield.
