 I grew up with a group of brilliant and strong women all around me, but they all struggled with something I think a lot of people deal with — they could not  negotiate . And neither could I. 
 My mother’s a professor with a science Ph.D. One grandma was a doctor in the 1940s. Her sister was as well. An aunt had been a dentist in the 1910s in Minsk. 
 My sister went from a fashion background to an MBA and business ownership and quickly learned the ropes. 
 I married a brilliant and strong woman who negotiates like second nature — and for pay, to great effect. The contrast, in some ways, could not be  stronger .  Click Here to Read Article …

 At first you thought they were just being very responsible. 
 Later you may have dubbed them “nitpicky.” 
 Until finally you realized that the perfect word for them is “micromanager,” and it’s definitely not a compliment. 
 Working with a micromanager can be extremely  stressful  and frustrating. 
 The act of micromanaging usually stems from perfectionism and distrust. Your micromanager may think that by clearly defining roles and specifying which task should be achieved exactly when and how, he is eliminating any chances of failure or mistakes. 
 To nip this evil in the bud requires a little patience. Here are six ways you can deal with a micromanager.  Click Here to Read Article …

 You've just started your  new job  at a big engineering firm, fresh out of college. 
 You go in with an attitude of part-anxiety and part-excitement to show off your youthful energy, even though you know that almost nothing that you learned in the last four years is going to be put to use at this job. 
 The last four years wasn't a waste, though. 
 You've learned how to  procrastinate  like a pro, how to take an exam with a solid three hours of sleep, and of course: How many beers it takes you to start singing karaoke. 
 But this is the real world. You're a little fish in a big corporate pond, and you'll be working alongside people that have been working in your industry for longer than you've been alive. 
 Confidence can be hard to come by at the beginning, but I assure you, with these ideas in mind, you'll have a great mindset going in.  Click Here to Read Article …

 Depending on  why  you are choosing, or have chosen, to  switch careers  you may be facing a variety of emotions — but it’s a safe bet that they will include both exhilaration and trepidation. 
 Finding your feet in a new field can take time. 
 That’s why it’s a good idea to lay the groundwork by taking at least one course that relates to the area you plan to work in, even if you’re just moving within a certain field. 
 Not only will this help acquaint you with any legal and professional issues you need to be across, it will also inform you about practices and information that might, at the beginning, be unfamiliar. 
 It’s important to choose a study program carefully and wisely.  Online courses  are very popular now, as they are flexible and can be fitted in around other commitments. 
 Use a good, comprehensive resource and make sure that you select a course that meets your needs and goals. Embarking on a period of study is also a great way to connect with others who will also be entering your chosen field, via online professional forums connected with the subject.

 They say the grass is not always greener on the other side, and in many cases, this may be true. 
 Similarly, we may think our current career as a bunch of baloney and another career (which we have long been  daydreaming  about) as something that is just what we need. 
 Let’s go back to the  grass is greener  phrase and look at some other meanings that people have attached to it: 
 If the grass is greener on the other side, would the other side think your grass is greener than their side? 
 The grass may be greener on the other side, but maybe yours will be greener if you water it . 
 If the grass is greener on the other side, there’s probably more manure there.   Click Here to Read Article …

 In the 2012-2020 Employment Projections released by the  Bureau of Labor Statistics on December 19, 2013 , an expected annual growth rate of 2.6 percent was recorded for the health care and social assistance sector. 
 From 2012 to 2022, demand for five million more jobs would follow. 
 In terms of occupations, four groups were expected to see growth of more than 20 percent, which was twice the overall rate. 
 The groups were 28.1 percent for healthcare support occupations, 21.5 percent for healthcare practitioners and technical occupations, 21.4 percent for construction and extraction occupations and 20.9 percent for personal care and service occupations. 
 With more than half of the occupational groups belonging to the healthcare and personal care industry, it’s clear that demand for a workforce that’s technically skilled and proficient will dominate the  job market  for the next ten years.  Click Here to Read Article …
