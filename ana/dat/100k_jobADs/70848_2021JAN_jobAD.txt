 God's Blessings 
 Well, this is a pretty simple job description. What is my job? It is to bless. That is it!! When I do, I am a blessing to others and I also get my Heavenly Father's blessing. 
 God's goal is for us to bless others. That is the focus that the Messiah Jesus wants us to have. Here are some ways to bless. Focus on these 5 characteristics will be a blessing to others. 
 
 Be agreeable with others. Find ways to agree, not disagree and argue. 
 By sympathetic. Understand the plight and difficulties in life. 
 Be loving. This is our main goal given to us from God. 
 Be compassionate. Demonstrate our concern. 
 Be humble. Humility is a huge thing in relationships. It comes out an attitude of service. 
 
 May I bless others at every turn today. 
 
 _ Summing up: Be agreeable, be sympathetic, be loving, be compassionate, be humble. That goes for all of you, no exceptions. No retaliation. No sharp-tongued sarcasm. Instead, bless—that’s your job, to bless. You’ll be a blessing and also get a blessing. 1 Peter 3:8

 What is worry? Do we know God? Do we know how God works?

 What is the proper response to God as His covenant people? Is it faithfulness?

 Will we regret it if we make a run for God? 
 What is the proper response to God as His covenant people? Is it faithfulness? 
 What is worry? Do we know God? Do we know how God works? 
 Do we understand love? Do we really get it? 
 What price did Jesus pay to redeem us? 
 Are there examples where Jesus didn't judge? 
 Can a gaabout gossip be trusted? Will someone of integrity violate a confidence? 
 Will we be resurrected? 
 Are we slaves or servants? What does Jesus think? 
 Why does Jesus ask so many questions? What are your answers?
