 Company Description 
 How about flexible hours that let you do your thing, whatever your thing is. The opportunity to grow. Professionally, personally and financially. How about the chance to be part of a company that’s primarily run by independent business owners and that’s active in your community. That’s helped more than 300,000 Canadian families with sick kids through Ronald McDonald House. If that sounds good to you, then we’d love to hear from you.

We need coverage from the hours of 11am-7pm and looking for someone with flexible availability who would be an asset to our team. Must be able to work in a team setting, with excellent customer service qualities and the ability to multi task while keeping the restaurant clean and sanitized.
