 What did I get myself into?

 Recently I was asked the question:  " Why did you get into radio marketing?" 
 At least once a week I find myself with my head on my desk asking myself a similar question:  " What did I get myself into?" 
 I don't think there are many people out there that say  " I want to sell radio advertising when I grow up!"  If they do then it's a safe bet they were dropped on their head, or held too close to a microwave as a small child. It's a "accidental career" for many. 
 As a child I was the bomb at selling Girl Scout Cookies. I didn't think twice when it came to selling ad space for school newsprint pieces. It was just another goal to hit, a "prize" to win. 
 
 Sometimes you even get to meet "celebrities"! 
 Did it look like fun? Well hell I have no clue! I was on the "other side of the building" so to speak. I was on the broadcasting side. I had spent most of my life behind a microphone or on a stage, and talking had never been a issue for me. Stage fright I wasn't prone to suffer  (unless it involved playing a piano)  and the other side of the business never occurred to me. Seriously. I was very early in my media days, and already had a background in fundraising. Somehow the two got mixed together and the right person heard of this combo and the next think I know is "sponsorships" are being explained to me. 
 Once upon a time I was on the air full time, I loved what I did. Then my boss asked me if I could go see a local business who did business with us. A  " shake their hand and make them feel good about what we do " thing. This local business owner handed me a check at the end of our visit and I went back to my boss a little bewildered. My first annual contract. It was so easy! All it took was me getting out from behind the microphone, going into a local business, talking to the owner for a bit and bam! They'd write me a check for an annual right? Yeah I'm still laughing my ass off over that one. 
 What I had seen amazed me. I could sell the "space" on the air where my voice went. What a novel idea! 
 I had applied for a on-air spot with a local radio group, soon after sending over my resume I got a call for a interview. The guy on the other end of the phone told me it wasn't for the on-air spot I sought, but for a sales job. After seeing my resume the "powers that be" wanted to exploit my background to make their stations money. The nerve! Oh wait I'd be making a good hunk more money than the on-air spot. I wasn't totally naive, I knew that it was easy to tell who drove what in the station parking lot. The management drove the brand new luxury cars, the sales staff drove the older luxury cars, the programing directors drove a station car, and the DJ's drove what they had driven in college. 
 Having my diverse background and education are two of my biggest assets. Right up there with the fact my balls are bigger than most guys, I'm a excellent actress, and oh I have boobs. 
 It's easy for me to draw on years of experience in media to help a client market their business in a way that is going to give them a strong ROI.  (return on investment)  I have been known to wake up from a sound sleep with a promotions idea or a commercial script. You don't want me in charge of the radio on a road trip because I will drive everyone in the car nuts listening to commercials in other markets. 
 Selling radio is hard work, harder than selling Girl Scout cookies. See everyone wants cookies, and deep down they need the yummy goodness known as Thin Mints. Not everyone knows that deep down their business would attract more qualified customers if they just advertised properly on the right radio station. Key word being "properly". 
 With the proper education, good training, a supportive management staff, and a proven product it's going to work. I love the seeing a clients business do well and thrive, and knowing I help craft the campaign that led them down a successful path. 
 It's HARD work. One of the hardest jobs I've ever had in my life, it's also the most FUN and rewarding in multiple ways. It's similar to pregnancy and motherhood. Only in radio sales if you are smart about your diet you'll avoid the stretch marks. 
 It's a blessing in life to be able to find something that enables you to do so many of the things that you love. I've also been very blessed to have some of the best clients, and great bosses. I came into my career in radio sales by way of many other routes, and I just wish selling annuals was as easy as the first one! üòâ

 She's one of the fastest deal cutters on the street. There won't be a dollar left on the table by the time she's finished with you. Your advertising budget will actually work and you will have customers! "Big Money Red" is BACK! 
 Radio crept into my blood rather quickly from a very early age. It started off with broadcasting then I went to what is refered to as "the dark side" aka sales later on in my career. I'm proud to be back with Brewer Media Group and representing some amazing media products and results. 
 It's taken me longer than I had planned to get my feet on the ground. I woke up on my first day back and thinking it would be just like where I had left off years before. Boy was I wrong. 
 Sales reps, let me give you a bit of advice. When you leave a sales job where you have clients that depend on you, take extra pains to make sure the next person that handles the account knows what in the world is going on. Be organized. Leave good notes. It's not about not caring about your previous company anymore, it's about truely caring about your client. If you care about your client and are truely a good account manager you will leave management with notes on each client and a one sheet break down in each folder as to details. That way the next person to take care of your client (it's not just handling an account) can pick up more smoohtly where you left off and the client dosen't get jolted too badly. It can be a high turnover industry and clients aren't just a commission check, for anyone. 
 Ok I'm off my soapbox now. 
 As I was saying‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ 
 I have "retired" from the advertising agency business and am back marketing radio and non-traditonal print. I couldn't be more excited and thrilled to be back with Brewer Media Group, truely a awsome company. 
 Making the transition from fulltime Mommy to working for someone else fulltime has been extremely difficult, both on myself and to a degree on Elle. We have been so used to being together so much of the time it's heartbreaking to be apart. I worked when Meg was little, and she was raised to a degree in a radio station. It was my plan for things to be different with Elle as she is the last one, the last baby, to keep the baby a baby as long as possible. I've also missed having my extra afternoon time with Meg, there just isn't enough time in an evening to get as much quality time in with your kids when you work fulltime as one would wish. 
 I'm planning on making some changes here on the site in the next month or so. A new design, some new topics (with a focus in sales tips / marketing agendas), and the struggle of a single mom trying to balance a full time career that she loves, in addition to squeezing in as much time as possible with my babies I love. 
 Oh and did I mention adding in the additional pressure of more health issues? That's another post. 
 Alas‚Ä¶. "Big Money Red" is back. üôÇ
