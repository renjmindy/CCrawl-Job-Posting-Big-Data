 Getting to know people in real life may be easy, but connecting with complete strangers online in hopes of gaining something from the exchange can be quite challenging. 
 It’s funny how every other advice-giver seems to love saying, “Make sure you  network ,” or “Try building connections,” without offering other pieces of crucial information concerning how on earth to do that! 
 The advice, it seems, is usually incomplete. 
 Every other Bob and Barbara knows that the networking game plays a major role when it comes to professions or  career advancement . 
 What they can’t seem to figure out is how to approach a random stranger online and actually get them to trust what they have to say.  Click Here to Read Article …

 Depending on  why  you are choosing, or have chosen, to  switch careers  you may be facing a variety of emotions — but it’s a safe bet that they will include both exhilaration and trepidation. 
 Finding your feet in a new field can take time. 
 That’s why it’s a good idea to lay the groundwork by taking at least one course that relates to the area you plan to work in, even if you’re just moving within a certain field. 
 Not only will this help acquaint you with any legal and professional issues you need to be across, it will also inform you about practices and information that might, at the beginning, be unfamiliar. 
 It’s important to choose a study program carefully and wisely.  Online courses  are very popular now, as they are flexible and can be fitted in around other commitments. 
 Use a good, comprehensive resource and make sure that you select a course that meets your needs and goals. Embarking on a period of study is also a great way to connect with others who will also be entering your chosen field, via online professional forums connected with the subject.

 In the  first of our series  on effectively relating freelance experience on resumes, we looked at some of the red flags employers see in such experience. 
 One of the ideas we stressed was that you can get around these red flags. 
 The way to do this is by assuring the employer that you’ve developed the  skills  he or she is looking for. 
 Here, in part two, we take a look at how to do just that.  Click Here to Read Article …

 If you’re a  freelancer  thinking of crossing over into the world of traditional employment, or if you straddle both worlds, you have to think about presenting self-employment on your resume. 
 One might be tempted to take an “it-is-what-it-is” approach, just plopping the experience into your resume. 
 But because working at home or running a business of any kind is different from being part of an organization, employers have their own particular ways of looking at such work on someone’s  resume . 
 Over the next couple of weeks, I’ll present a series on ways to incorporate your freelance work onto your resume. 
 Today’s post will focus on some of the potential red flags that employers sometimes perceive.  Click Here to Read Article …
