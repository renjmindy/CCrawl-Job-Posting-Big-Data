 We're Chip. We're here to make saving effortless, easy and fun. Our mission is to build the best savings app in the world. 
 We help people save up money automatically. Infact, we've automatically saved more than ¬£150 million for tens of thousands of our savers already. 
 We've done all this by using AI, Open Banking and a disruptive approach to traditional banking. 
 Now, we're helping people get better returns automatically, too. 
 You can open a market leading savings account in a couple of taps in Chip, as well as deposit, track and withdraw your money. 
 As you sit back, save and earn interest, we'll keep going to the banks on your behalf to negotiate better rates. 
 This was a service that used to only be available to the super-rich, but we've done some clever things to pool Chip savers' money, so we can negotiate with banks like you're a millionaire. 
 Sounds pretty good, eh? And we're just getting started. 
 Chip is being built by a fast-growing team of designers, developers, customer service professionals, marketers, banking experts, and entrepreneurs, with the backing of more than 11,000 investors and a huge community of Chip savers.
