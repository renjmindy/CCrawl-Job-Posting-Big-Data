 Create a video for presentation 
 Published: 2 weeks ago  Bids: 1 
 There has been quite a push to get rid of cash these past few years driven by governments, retailers, banks and other societal pressures. Cash provides something digital payments do not normally provide, the ability to make offline & anonymous payments. Should we be so keen to abandon cash entirely? 
Are we okay with tech companies and banks knowing everything we purchase, where we spend, who we spend with then selling that data on or using it to target us with advertisements and content? Are we okay with governments implementing large scale warrantless #FinancialSurveillance operations on the populace? Are we okay with our spending and saving data being used to score, rate, rank us in everything from job applications to dating profiles? 
What starts out as laws to restrict money laundering and terrorist financing can easily become a financial snoopers charter. 
If we are not okay with all this then what checks and balances can be put in place? 
Based on the above scenario create a video on  “Good Bye Cash …”
