  How Volunteering Can Help You Get A Job In Healthcare  
 Ryan Hughes 
 November 07, 2013 
 Working in the health care industry can be highly competitive. There are many areas where talented individuals are in high demand, but it can still be a challenge to get a job. The leading  elderly care  facilities may have hundreds of applications coming in for a single position. This is why it can be advantageous to volunteer in care first. You need every edge that you can get in today's job market. When you volunteer at a health care facility, they are able to see who you are and how you handle yourself with others. This can be a great way to demonstrate that you are capable of working in the facility – and it is likely going to boost your chances of a future care job with that company. 
 
 How Volunteering Can Help You Get A Job In Healthcare 
 Here are some ways volunteering can help you get into the healthcare field: 
 Volunteer In Various Programs 
 ****It’s a good idea to volunteer whenever you can into the various programs offered at a health care facility. They may be looking for candy stripers or people to sit and read stories to the elderly. Regardless of the program, you should plan on spending the time inside the health care facility so you can familiarize yourself with various people of importance and show that you are dedicated to caring for others. While you are volunteering in the programs, people will see your attitude and actions. You will learn many of the tasks needed around the hospital. The more time you spend in the programs, the more opportunities you will be given to prove you belong there full-time. You can add volunteering to your resume. When you don’t have much experience in the way of working in health care facilities, the volunteer work can ensure you have something that shows you are committed to the industry (and more importantly, the people). 
 Get To Know Different People 
 There are usually health care employees in charge of the various volunteer programs. You may get to know some of the charge nurses, heads of the different departments, and even the administrators of the health care facility. Getting to know these individuals will allow you to demonstrate your work ethic and start a good working relationship with them. When you want to make a career out of caring for others, you need to share this with the people you encounter. You can boost your chances of getting a job in the care industry when you have people who can vouch for your work ethic and show that you have the bedside manner that a facility is looking for. It can be difficult to show that you have good bedside manner – and this is why it’s important to do volunteer work. Health care facilities are more likely to hire someone they already know or that have been recommended to them because of their attitude. A facility is only as good as their employees and many patients want someone who has poise and sensitivity. Even if there are no openings at the health care facility that you are volunteering at, it’s still advantageous for you to donate your time. You need something on your resume that helps you stand out from everyone else. If a facility sees that you are regularly volunteering your time in one program or another, it shows that you are committed to the health care industry – and this is highly desired by many administrators. Whether you are enrolled in a health care education program now or not, you can start volunteering. You may not have any qualifications to work in the health care industry right now, but volunteering will ensure you get the good start you need.  Enjoy this article? You've got time for another!
