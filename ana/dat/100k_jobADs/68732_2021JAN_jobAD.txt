 Because of these uncertain times and  Coronavirus at large , it's more important than ever that we stay healthy. Since our jobs are our source of livelihood, it's essential that we avoid missing work due to illness. Staying healthy on the job means that we will continue to earn enough money to take care of ourselves in our families. 
 Regardless of what kind of a job you have, it's in your best interest to avoid any sort of injury or illness while you're there. Even stationary jobs can lead to some form of injury if you're not careful. Take a look at some of the best tips for ensuring that you stay healthy on the job, other than washing your hands regularly.

 Eat Well 
 One of the single most important things that you can do for your body is to  eat a well-balanced diet . One of the easiest ways to get tired during your workday is to fill your body full of unhealthy and heavy foods. You won't be able to sustain your energy for very long if you lack essential nutrients and vitamins. 
 It's a good idea to pack your lunch ahead of time so that you can control what goes into your body. Failing to pack your lunch ahead of time could lead to spontaneous bad decisions. When you're in a hurry, sometimes the only thing to eat is fast food. Do yourself a favor and take the time to pack your lunch ahead of time. 
 Move More 
 A lot of people can't stand the idea of going to the gym and working out. Believe it or not, however, staying active doesn't necessarily mean you need a pair of barbells and a gym membership. 
 In many cases, being more active is as simple as going for a brisk walk once a day.  Exercising regularly  will give yourself a boost of energy as well as keep your body strong. You raise your heart rate and therefore improve your cardiovascular health. Above all, you'll be less inclined to develop obesity, which is one of the leading causes of death in the United States. 
 Sleep More 
 A lot of people take sleep for granted. The truth is that sleep is one of the best things that you can do to keep your immune system going strong. When you sleep, your body restores itself and improves things like memory and concentration. If you're not getting enough sleep, you'll become much more susceptible to illness and even injury. 
 Not only that, but sleeping more will help you wake up earlier. You'll find yourself much more productive with more hours of the day to use. If you have a problem going to bed earlier, try to avoid screens for at least two hours prior to your bedtime. After a while, an earlier bedtime will become second nature.
