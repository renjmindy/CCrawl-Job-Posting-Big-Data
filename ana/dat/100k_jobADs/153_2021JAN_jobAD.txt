 Join Our Team 
 What is Work 365? 
 Work 365 is the holistic business application built on Dynamics CRM. Our worldwide team of game-changers brings the unique combination of technical expertise and client empathy, with a touch of nerdy humor on the side. The Cloud and Subscriptions are revolutionizing how technology businesses operate, and our application helps these companies realize their potential. We provide technology that enables our clients to effectively capitalize on this revolution and scale their business for long-term success. 
 Who we Are 
 Our team is comprised of cloud veterans who are fast-moving, entrepreneurial, agile and intellectually curious problem-solvers. We pride ourselves on delivering value by placing the customer at the center of everything we do and have a passion for helping businesses scale and grow effectively. 
 How we Work 
 Our client’s success is our success, so we believe in the community we're building. We’re number-crunchers and technologists at heart, but our true passion is helping our customers succeed. Their voice is paramount to our success, and we provide multiple channels to ensure their feedback informs how we operate. We offer biweekly training and have a vast library of best practice knowledge articles, but we’re continually learning ourselves, and we wouldn’t have it any other way.

 " Work 365 is one of the effective Microsoft CSP Billing Platform for Cloud Service Providers. I love the Graphical Representation of the important metrics. Addition of invoicing template in Dynamics CRM is very helpful." 
 - Paul Adams 
 " We scaled to over 6,000 licenses without adding another support person. Onboarding each new customer took up to an hour but now we can do it in 3 minutes or less, saving us over 100s of hours since June 2018. Because of these efficiencies, our projected growth for our CSP business is 300%." 
 - Donavan Lane 
 " Though it took us some effort to transition into Work 365, it has been well worth it. The system is providing immediate benefits within just days of cutting the ribbon." 
 - Thomas Carpe 
 " We could have gone with a local vendor but wanted to work with a company that could support the same platform across all our regions."
