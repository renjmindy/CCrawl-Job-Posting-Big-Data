 Terrifying Visions and the Art of Trusting the Gift

 " The Ghost and My Obsession" by Michele Bledsoe 
 Several years ago I was sitting at my desk 
 in my high-level corporate job 
 and I had a terrifying vision. 
 I imagined myself far in the future 
 sitting at the same desk.. 
 doing exactly the same thing 
 and wondering to myself 
 what life would have been like 
 if I had decided to pursue my art instead. 
 Not long after that, I quit my job.. 
 and let my path take me to where I was meant to be 
 instead of where I thought I should go. 
 In life, as in art 
 we must be fearless. 
 Trust the gift.
