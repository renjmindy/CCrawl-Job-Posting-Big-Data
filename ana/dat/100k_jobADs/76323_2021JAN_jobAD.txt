 Get a fresh perspective on your career

 What topics does maternity coaching cover? 
 
 Here are some of the practical and emotional issues involved in returning to work that we will cover during the coaching process: 
 
 Your values and life priorities, and the different career options available to you. 
 Developing your self-belief and confidence, and finding the 'working you' again. 
 The practicalities of returning to work including childcare arrangements, building your support network, and setting and communicating new boundaries. 
 Feelings of working mother's anxiety and guilt and how to overcome them. 
 Balancing different identities and roles at work and at home. 
 Renegotiating your role and scope for flexible working, 
 Establishing and communicating sustainable working patterns. 
 Maximising your effectiveness and performance once you get back to work 
 Building new workplace relationships. 
 Devising and demonstrating your 'personal brand' - how do you want to be known in the workplace? 
 Career development next steps.​ 
 
 ​ 
At the end of the coaching, you'll feel more confident and better equipped to handle any challenges that might lie ahead, and will have mapped out a clear route back to work. You'll come away with a concrete return-to-work action plan, along with a plan for your first 90 days back in the workplace so you'll know exactly what you'll need to do once you get there. ​ 
 Choose between one-to-one or group coaching 
 
 ​We offer one-on-one coaching to give you the support of a confidential sounding board, or group workshops to share experiences and tips with women in the same situation as you. Either option will make a huge difference to how positive, prepared and in control you'll feel - both at work and at home.
