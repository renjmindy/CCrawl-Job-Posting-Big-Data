 Job 29 
 1 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 
 2 Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me; 
 3 When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness; 
 4 As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle; 
 5 When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me; 
 6 When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil; 
 7 When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street! 
 8 The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up. 
 9 The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth. 
 10 The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth. 
 11 When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me: 
 12 Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him. 
 13 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. 
 14 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem. 
 15 I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame. 
 16 I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out. 
 17 And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth. 
 18 Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand. 
 19 My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch. 
 20 My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand. 
 21 Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel. 
 22 After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them. 
 23 And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain. 
 24 If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down. 
 25 I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.

 When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness; 
Job 29:3 KJV 
 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. 
Psalms 119:105 KJV 
 When the path gets dark before us, the only way through is by the light of God's Word. We may not understand the darkness we are in. We may not know why we are called to walk through it when we've been faithfully serving Him. We may not see an end to it in sight; and we may feel that no matter what we do, it just keeps getting darker. However, there is always light to be found in God's promises and presence. 
 We can always hold on to hope when we remember that this world is temporary and not our home. We have a place prepared and reserved for us where there will be no more tears, no disappointments, no pain, no unanswered prayers, no darkness. Just joy. Just life. Just living in His Light. 
 Therefore, we can do this. We can see in the darkness. We don't have to give in to the despair that lurks in the night. His Word can sustain us, uplift us, show us the way through. We just have to abide in it and allow it to take root in us. 
 There is no light in a closed Bible, but if we will Eat This Book continually, the light of His love will begin to glow in us and radiate from us. We will become His light in this dark world.

 This chapter in the MSG is captioned "When God Was Still by My Side". This reminded me of what Rev. Smith said last night "God hasn't moved, He is right there where you left Him". Sometimes, we tend to be so blinded by our situation or storm that we may be going through that we forget Psalm 108:13 CEV "You are the one 
who gives us victory and crushes our enemies. Same verse GNT "With God on our side we will win; he will defeat our enemies." This also brought the song "We Have Overcome" to mind: 
 We've got the victory! 
Everything would be alright, alright! 
We've got the victory! 
Everything would be alright 
Cause we're on the winning side 
We're on the winning side! 
We have overcome 
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! 
We have overcome 
By the power of Your name 
Jesus You're the One

 “When I went out to the gate of the city, When I took my seat [as a city father] in the square, The young men saw me and hid themselves, The aged arose and stood [respectfully]; 
 The princes stopped talking And put their hands on their mouths; 
 The voices of the nobles were hushed, And their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.” 
‭‭JOB‬ ‭29:7-10‬ ‭AMP‬‬ 
 I am believing the same outcome when we as a church apriach this city like this that this is how their response will be. I believe this because now when we approach people individually most of their responses are like all these descriptions above. They hush, the listen, they wanna know what’s going on and how this time is connected with the Bible and the last days. People are scared, and then there are people who don’t care but I’m telling you there are more people who care than you think. We never know who really does believe and who doesn’t until we open our mouths and begin to talk about our Lord. There are people I would’ve thought was atheist that actually believed in Jesus Christ. Just the other day this happened. Immediately my heart began to ache for those particular people because they’re not approached enough. I can’t be the only one who thought this. We must desire boldness we must seek ye first the Kingdom in us, out there, or wherever we are.

One day you are on top, the next minute you are down to nothing. 
Suddenly life can change, how are we in the faith? 
When we are down to nothing, God is still up to something. 
Let us still assume our position as children of God

 Job 29 
‘My root is spread out and open to the waters, 
And the dew lies all night upon my branch. 
 I believe Job was taking a walk down memory lane. 
He is proclaiming all he has done. Some might say it was out of pride or boasting. Yet memories of what God has done within your life can give you encouragement to continue when everything you once had us gone ;who you use to be has been altered by life . Thank You God for good memories and knowing that You have been right there in the midst . There is strength in God. It is well !!!!!! 
 Colossians 2:7 
7 Plant your roots in Christ and let him be the foundation for your life. Be strong in your faith, just as you were taught. And be grateful. 
 1 Corinthians 10:31. I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being. -

“Like a chief, I told them what to do. I lived like a king among his troops and comforted those who mourned.” 
‭‭Job‬ ‭29:25‬ ‭NLT‬‬ 
 Wow, if you read this whole chapter in the NLT, it is very eye opening. When I’ve read Job before, I kinda just thought Job was just some rich feller who lived on a farm in the middle of nowhere. But if you can imagine with me for a while, that wasn’t who Job was… he was more like a righteous Prince Charles of the British Royal family. From now on why I read about Job, I will see him as one of the most famous and respected on the world scene. This even makes the story of Job more compelling for the fact that he was pushed to the ultimate limit.

 Everything I did was honest. Righteousness covered me like a robe, and I wore justice like a turban. I served as eyes for the blind and feet for the lame. I was a father to the poor and assisted strangers who needed help. 
Job 29:14‭-‬16 NLT 
 https://bible.com/bible/116/job.29.14-16.NLT 
 God used Job to help all that were in need. He was blessed and favored to all that knew him. That is how it should be. I/we should be the ones to help. To be the eyes for the blind and feet for the lame. God knows how to use each of His children. He strategically places us where He needs us. Lord use me this day to do your work.

 “I long for the years gone by when God took care of me, when he lit up the way before me and I walked safely through the darkness. When I was in my prime, God’s friendship was felt in my home. The Almighty was still with me, and my children were around me. My steps were awash in cream, and the rocks gushed olive oil for me. 
Job 29:2‭-‬6 NLT 
 https://bible.com/bible/116/job.29.2-6.NLT 
 Job was a blessed man, and because of his reverence and respect for God, because of his faithfulness God blessed his family! God knows our heart, we can be doing all the right things but what are our motives, I need to check myself all the time, because I dont want to have bad motives, I crave a relationship like the one Job had with God, it's obvious that he was a great man, doing excellent things in his community, but God saw more!

 He is saying that the blind follow who they choose 
to follow, he is also saying that he helped those who could not be amazing like others, and he is saying that he helped the poor like he was thier father would.

 Job's trouble and issue wasn't that he lacked righteousness but rather that he trusted in it rather than the God who made him righteous. Just because God redeems us and helps us to grow and become better as individuals and just because we walk the right path does not justify and detour anything bad from happening to you. Job had a failed expectation, he had the supposition that nothing bad should happen to him because he was a righteous man rather than trusting in the God who made him. When we give up that supposition that nothing should happen to us we allow God reign over our Life in all areas

 It's easier to serve God when the blessings are rolling in. When the tests of faith come though, look out! Why is it so easy for us to forget the grace and mercy that God has shown us? When we seek after His Kingdom first, then we will not so easily forget what He has done for us.

Job 29:14-16 (NLT) 
 We serve the Lord by reaching the lost and serving them. There are people looking for help, looking for hope, looking for anyone to trust. We are the body of Christ and we must move and reach as so, we must shine His light and share His love.

 “Everyone listened to my advice. They were silent as they waited for me to speak. And after I spoke, they had nothing to add, for my counsel satisfied them. They longed for me to speak as people long for rain. They drank my words like a refreshing spring rain. 
Job 29:21‭-‬23 NLT 
 https://bible.com/bible/116/job.29.21-23.NLT 
 When we walk in the peace and wisdom of God and we hide HIS WORD in our hearts others can tell. There is stability and truth in what we say. When those that struggle with their walk are in need they may look for wise counsel. We can be that for people when we allow God to work through us.

 14 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem. 
 15 I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame. 
 16 I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out. 
 I am thinking this morning that when Job proclaimed in the few verses above: being clothed in his righteousness and his judgement was his robe and diadem. He states he became the eyes to the blind and the feet of the lame. The father of the poor and the cause he knew not but searched it out. I believe we as children of God have to have the same mind frame to be exactly what the world needs and not desires. We have to be a sure word in a world that is in the midst of chaos and confusion. We can be the foundation that many can stand on to find that God is the perfect refuge and strong tower for them to be able to come into and find peace. They also can find joy, happiness, and they can find eternal love for their soul. 
 We must make ourselves available for the needs of the kingdom and for God first. Seeking him and all his righteousness first to be an available vessel for his spirit. We can not afford the time to miss those that are hurting and dying in this messed up world. 
 Jesus called us to be great witnesses to his kingdom and his ways. It’s time to stop playing church and be the church! 
 I love the Kingdom!

 I remember when…. 
 “Oh, that I were as in the months of old, As in the days when God watched over me, When His lamp shone upon my head And by His light I walked through darkness; As I was in the prime of my days, When the friendship and counsel of God were over my tent, When the Almighty was still with me And my boys were around me, 
JOB 29:2‭-‬5 AMP 
 Just last night bro. Garcia and i was remembering when our lives started as a Christian and remembering some of the people that walked along with us on our journey. Sad to say many have walked away from their first love. This could jave well been us. But GOD in His mercy and love kept us as we went through many trials. 
There is nothing wrong with visiting your past , just don't stay there. As we see here in this chapter, I believe Job was encouraging himself in the Lord as he talked about the goodness of the Lord! 
GOD is always faithful and true, stay the course, don't waiver in your faith, don't look to the right or the left, but keep your eyes focused on the Lord!!

 FIRST THE KINGDOM 
FIRST FIRE 
 3 When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness; 
 FIRE and LIGHT are clear and powerful descriptions of The Kingdom of GOD. The FIRE or PASSION that burns in our hearts when we are newly converted from sin to the savior JESUS. 
 It is much like the candle of the LORD on our head, a fresh, clear, bright light shining on us. We know the original purpose of a candle is to provide light to a room or area. Confirming the principal of more candles; producing more light. 
 As we continue to Seek FIRST The Kingdom of GOD, let us remember that we are HIS Light to this world and we must let HIS Light shine through us. Permitting HIS candle to burn in us.

 As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle; 
 5 When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me; 
 This reminded me of Habakuk's prayer in Chapters 2 & 3: 
17 Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls: 
 18 Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation. 
 19 The Lord God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places.

 What cloak are we wearing today? Our righteousness is as filthy rags, but casting those down and picking up HIS righteous changes us completely. No more is things about me but it’s about Him and His Kingdom. We become transparent and He is free to work through us and in in us so that He gets the glory!

 I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out. 
Job 29:16 KJV 
Job searched for answers and God's Word is to searched because it shows our hunger to really know Him. 
Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. 
John 5:39 KJV 
It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter. 
Proverbs 25:2 KJV 
And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables? He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. 
Matthew 13:10‭-‬11‭, ‬13 KJV 
God's Word must be searched with the whole heart, then God reveals Himself to you but to the casual observer, they will not find Him!

Job was thinking about beautiful days of his past, before the devil was allowed to attack him. Perhaps looking at the beautiful mountain top from his current place in a valley. Perhaps it would uplift us to gaze at the mountain top when we are feeling down in a valley.

 “when he lit up the way before me and I walked safely through the darkness.”(Job‬ ‭29:3‬ ‭NLT‬‬) 
 What I love about this verse is that God was with Job everywhere he went. God always lit way before Job in any type of situation. It makes me think how strong Job faith is in God and how fearless Job was when he walked through the darkness unharmed with God on his side through it all.

 ““Those were the days when I went to the city gate and took my place among the honored leaders. The young stepped aside when they saw me, and even the aged rose in respect at my coming. The princes stood in silence and put their hands over their mouths. The highest officials of the city stood quietly, holding their tongues in respect. “All who heard me praised me. All who saw me spoke well of me. For I assisted the poor in their need and the orphans who required help. I helped those without hope, and they blessed me. And I caused the widows’ hearts to sing for joy. Everything I did was honest. Righteousness covered me like a robe, and I wore justice like a turban. I served as eyes for the blind and feet for the lame. I was a father to the poor and assisted strangers who needed help. I broke the jaws of godless oppressors and plucked their victims from their teeth.” 
‭‭Job‬ ‭29:7-17‬ ‭NLT‬‬ 
 Not only did Job gain the attention of the people and leaders of the city in days past; they also liked him and what he had to say. He was blessed and approved by those who heard him.

 When things start going wrong, not the way we planned we tend to "look back" and desire the days when the we had it better. If we are honest with ourselves at first it is hard to trust God. We have to fight our flesh and our logic, because according to ourselves we know what's best for us. The truth is that our flesh, even our heart are deceitful. GOD us the one that knows what we need and when. If we keep our eyes fixed on Him when wont see how hard we "may have it" or so we say. God always wants us to go forward and grow.

 Returning back to our roots back to our first love. Renewing our spirits in the lord. Remembering how it was to be a child in the lord. Remind yourself daily how you felt when the holy spirit was new to you. Praise Jesus for that love and warmth you felt.

 18 Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand. 
 Job rememberers a time of prosperity in his dark time. Sometimes reflecting on glorious victories God has given us can encourage us to push forward. At other times it can increase the anger with in us, searching for the why. Why have people turned their backs and mock me in my turmoil? Why do those I helped now despise me? These questions that have no understanding to an intellectual man of wisdom. Job still is a righteous man, and the glory of his prior days will not be able to match the two fold blessing headed his way. This trial is a revelation of self, revelation of God and to shut hells mouth.

 When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me: 
12 Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him. 
13 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy. 
14 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem. 
 How many of us can say that people react to us the way they would react to Job. The true testament of a Christian, of a Pentecostal. When people saw him they hushed and listened with intent in what he would have to say. He would help so many people including the poor and the fatherless. He blessed people everywhere he went and people took notice to that and gave reverence and appreciated his presence. He truly let his light shine. We could learn so much from Job’s example and try to be that same light. Try to be that same blessing to people everywhere.

 ““Everyone listened to my advice. They were silent as they waited for me to speak. And after I spoke, they had nothing to add, for my counsel satisfied them. They longed for me to speak as people long for rain. They drank my words like a refreshing spring rain.” 
‭‭-Job‬ ‭29:21-23‬ ‭NLT‬‬ 
 Having the word of God in your heartfelt gives you wisdom. It helps you guide others, counsel them, and bring them closer to Jesus. Sharing the Word of God to others is like giving water to the thirsty; giving life to the dead.

 13As soon as Laban heard that his nephew Jacob had arrived, he ran out to meet him. He embraced and kissed him and brought him home. When Jacob had told him his story, 14Laban exclaimed, “You really are my own flesh and blood!” 
 Its always great to embrace those who haven't seen in a while. Even when you come up to family, even if its been 1-2 days, embrace them. Those hugs are memories to cherish.
