 Type: 
 Full Time - Internship 
 Years of Experience: 
 Less than 2 
 Preferred Education: 
 Some College 
 Interns in this geographically-distributed REU program have the opportunity to participate in research using the Rosetta Commons software. The Rosetta Commons software suite includes algorithms for computational modeling and analysis of protein structures. It has enabled notable scientific advances in computational biology, including de novo protein design, enzyme design, ligand docking, and structure prediction of biological macromolecules and macromolecular complexes. 
 Students learn the inner details of the PyRosetta and community coding environment. Students research in a molecular modeling and design laboratory, developing new algorithms and discovering new science. Interns are mentored by faculty and graduate interns. 
 The Program: 
 
 One week of Rosetta Code School, where you will learn the inner details of the Rosetta C++ code and community coding environment, so you are fully prepared for the summer! 
 8 weeks of hands-on research in a molecular modeling and design laboratory, developing new algorithms and discovering new science. 
 The summer will finish with a trip to the Rosetta Conference, where you will present your research in a poster and connect with Rosetta developers from around the world. The sponsor, NSF, will provide housing, travel expenses, and a stipend. 
 
 Projects include: 
 
 “Designing new protein switches for synthetic biology applications” 
 "Antibody engineering by deep learning " 
 “Designing small-molecules that break down cancer-driving protein” 
 “Design of novel transposases for scarless DNA-insertion using Rosetta” 
 “De Novo Protein Design for Immunotherapeutics” 
 “Design of Dengue Virus Subunit Vaccines” 
 “Applying high-throughput experimental data to guide computational protein design” 
 
 …and many more 
 
 
 College Sophomores or Juniors preferred. 
 Major in computer science, engineering, mathematics, chemistry, biology, and/or biophysics. 
 Available for at least 10 weeks during the summer of 2020. 
 Interest in graduate school 
 While not required, we seek candidates with some combination of experiences in scientific or academic research, C++/Python/*nix/databases, software engineering, object-oriented programming, and/or collaborative development. 
 Only U.S. citizens and permanent residents are eligible to apply, per NSF guidelines. 
 
 
 NOTES: 
 18 openings.

 About Johns Hopkins University 
 The Johns Hopkins Institute for NanoBioTechnology (INBT) is an exceptionally diverse, multidisciplinary team of faculty, researchers, and student experts uncovering new knowledge and creating innovative technologies at the interface of nanoscience, engineering, and medicine. Launched in 2006, INBT aims to revolutionize research by fostering a collaborative environment among engineers, scientist, and clinicians to pioneer new ways to solve some of the most complex challenges in healthcare and the environment. It brings together experts from the Bloomberg School of Public Health, School of Medicine, Whiting School of Engineering, Applied Physics Lab, and Krieger School of Arts and Sciences. INBT’s research focuses on improving and searching for new solutions to challenges in healthcare and the environment. It supports research utilizing nanoscience to advance our understanding of cellular and molecular dynamics. Researchers use this knowledge to develop novel diagnostic tools for early disease detection, study stem cells and regenerative engineering to repair damaged and diseased tissues, and engineer cancer therapies by studying cancerous cells at a precise level of detail in a three-dimensional environment
