 Hello Everyone! Another round of YEMP (Youth Employment Mentorship Program) is right around the corner. Please apply here or drop off your resume at the Cowichan Valley Youth Services by December 11th to be considered for our next intake! The next group of participants will begin the program on January 4th. 
 A bit about the Youth Employment Mentorship Program: 
 YEMP is aimed to help youth (ages 15-30) gain skills and confidence to enter the working world. Through workshops and job coaching we meet you where you are and help you get to where you want to go. YEMP is a 12 week commitment. The first 6 weeks participants will receive paid life/job skills training and various certificates. The last 6 weeks the participants will continue receiving support in their newly acquired position or continued job search. 
 This program started in September 2014 and 98% of youth have been successful in finding work, returning to school or job searching. The Cowichan Valley employers have been super supportive of this program and we thank all of them for their mentorship and encouragement to our youth participants. 
 Employers who hire a YEMP graduate are eligible to claim a wage reimbursement of a minimum of 50% of min. wage (14.60/hour).
