 My client, a leading retail distributor of fast-moving consumer goods in an e-commerce environment, is looking to recruit two Team Leaders for their facility based in Birmingham. The roles will be predominantly "day shifts" but candidates must be prepared to work rotating shifts as volumes require especially as we head into the traditional retail distribution peak. 
 As they grow, my client is acutely aware of the need for succession planning; this is a fantastic opportunity for the right candidate to help drive change and expansion onsite. The company hope that the successful candidate will contribute to the growth of the business and progress within their ranks. The role is available due to huge volume numbers being distributed from site during the COVID pandemic. 
 Reporting directly to an Operations Manager, the Team Leader will play a key role in ensuring the highest standards are achieved onsite whilst giving full operational support to the Operations Manager. The successful Team Leader will lead their team to meet operational objectives within a fast-moving e-commerce fulfilment centre. You will be asked to build a strong team and provide warehouse operatives with the direction needed to ensure success. You will be an escalation point for your team, responsible for feeding issues back to your Operations Manager whilst dealing with any issues in the first instance. You will communicate on performance issues and identify the training required, ensuring that team members work in an efficient and safe manner to achieve maximum levels of performance. 
 To be successful in this role you will be an experienced Team Leader from a fast-moving e-commerce or retail environment and be highly customer focused, managing and motivating shift operations to achieve daily output targets and deliver shift KPIs. 
 The salary package for the role is c£22,000 with some additional benefits, if the role sounds of interest then please apply or contact Phil Birch for more details. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
