 Le Dream Job? 
 You can read  here  about my delightful (and difficult) experiences last year in Paris (a wonderful trip, though I confess that the only restaurants that ever made me break down and cry with frustration were located in this city; and I couldn't stand being lost all the time…in the endless rain), so I know I couldn't possibly run anything French-related. But this has got to be a fabulous opportunity for SOMEONE…maybe you! 
 Wanted: Resident Director for VCCA (   Virginia Center for the Creative Arts  **) Program in France 
** 
The VCCA is seeking a Fellow to manage the VCCA's Moulin a Nef Studio Center in Auvillar, France, working an average of 25 hours a week in exchange for housing and a small stipend from April through October 2009. Fluency in French is required. Please send a resume and letter of interest to Executive Director Suny Monk by December 1, 2008. 
 Check the  web site  for details and more information. 
 Also, if you'd like to write in France but not necessarily run a program, please note that the VCCA offers fellowship opportunities  in France  and a  number of other countries .
