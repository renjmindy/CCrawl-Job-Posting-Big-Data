 About Imperfect Imperfect Foods was founded in 2015 with a mission to reduce food waste and build a better food system for everyone. We offer imperfect (yet delicious) produce, affordable pantry items, and quality meat and dairy. We deliver them conveniently to our customersâ€™ doorsteps and pride ourselves on offering up to a 30% discount compared to grocery store prices. Our customers can get the healthy, seasonal produce they want alongside the grocery staples they rely on, without having to compromise their budget or values. Weâ€™re proving that doing the right thing for the planet doesnâ€™t have to cost more, and that shopping for quality ingredients can support the people and resources that it takes to grow our favorite foods. Our software engineering team builds the e-commerce platform and internal tooling that makes this all possible. Engineers donâ€™t just build widgets -- we participate in the full lifecycle of a feature, from conception to release. Weâ€™re a remote-first team with members throughout the US. We have heaps of interesting problems to solve around customer experience, logistics, supply chain and scale. Weâ€™re looking for an experienced machine learning engineer to help us take the work out of grocery shopping by building our capabilities in personalization, recommendation engines, and business optimization.
