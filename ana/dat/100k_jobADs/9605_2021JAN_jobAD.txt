 As he glided across his rooftop pool supported by a  noodle  , Suddenly the sky turned black across Gotham City. 
 He admired several of his enemy‚Äôs traits. Lex was  tenacious  , ** forthright  **and had the Imagination to think of something to cause havoc. Now He‚Äôd met his  match  in Superman.

 Glad to hear it. Is it full time, part time and what kind of work is it?

 It's full time and it's data analysis, looking producing spreadsheets and looking for patterns in the numbers. It's early days, but I am enjoying it so far. üôÇ

 I thought I had, but I can never remember who I've told. üôÇ Of course I'd have rather become a famous author, but so far, no famous literary agent has seen my work and offered me a contract, oh well. üòâ

 Indeed, it's hard to become a published author these days sadly, perhaps the way is to write a book, sel publish and then maybe get noticed?
