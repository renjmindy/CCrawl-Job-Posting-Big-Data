 Deb Brown & Becky McCray 
 We’re partnering with Deb Brown and Becky McCray from  SaveYour.Town  to talk about a topic we all want to know more about:  Rural Jobs Creation Strategies. 
 How do small towns and rural communities create jobs in a globalized economy? We do it by building connections. When we connect entrepreneurs to each other, they support each other with lessons learned, ideas and more connections. By connecting entrepreneurs to resources, they gain the support they need to grow and create jobs. You'll learn about creating special connection events and supporting places where connections will happen. You'll leave with practical steps you can put into action to create more jobs in your town by Building Connections. 
 This webinar comes in two parts: a 30 minute recorded lesson plus a one hour live discussion. Both are being held on the same day, Friday, April 13th. We'll watch the recording at 9 am and have some time to discuss what we've seen and formulate some questions. At 10:00 am we'll join the live discussion and Q&A session with Becky, Deb and people in other rural areas across the US and Canada. 
 There is no charge for this webinar and space is limited. 
 The webinar is currently full. If you 'd like to be added to a waiting list, please email greg@workplacesonora.com.
