 About this project 
 design-multimedia / images-for-social-networks 
 Less than USD 10 / hour 
 We're are an advertising agency based in Florida. We're looking for a talented graphic designer who enjoys designing Ad creatives for our Facebook advertisements we run for different clients. 
 You'll be working in collaboration with our copywriter and account manager to create compelling designs that help us transmit the message of our ads effectively. 
 Project Requirements: 
 - Turnaround time is important for us since we depend on the ad creatives to be able to release ads for our clients. We can establish a turnaround time together that is reasonable and we both can agree on. 
 - We need at least 1-2 hours of overlap with our time zone (EST) to for strategy and feedback video calls at least 2 days per week. 
 - We need you to enjoy working within a team team and communicate with them in a timely and friendly manner :slightly_smiling_face: You can expect the same from your team. 
 We are looking for someone who resonates with our core values which are: 
 -> Do the right thing (even when nobody's watching) 
-> Good isnâ€™t enough. Excellence is essential 
-> Give more than you take 
-> When things go wrong, go 10X (take massive action) 
-> Bring the joy to people's lives 
-> Accept responsibility 
-> Always be learning 
-> Believe (have faith in yourself and in your capability to do something great). 
 Hourly rate: $8 to $15 per hour depending on experience (with the potential to grow as you bring value to our team) 
 Weekly hours available: initially 2-10 hours per week (varies based on demand). Will likely grow very soon because we are growing fast. 
 Please send us your portfolio of relevant designs on your application. 
 If you've read and understood the application include the phrase "Messi is the best" in your application.
