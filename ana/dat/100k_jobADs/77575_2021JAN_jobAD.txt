 Suitable For Vegans - Original Source Shower Hibiscus & Pomegranate Tea, Vanilla & Raspberry, Skin Quench Cherry & Jojoba Oil 
 August 4, 2017 Mrs Strawberry Blonde   Bath & Shower ,  Original Source   7 Comments 
 Hi there! Today I'm reviewing 3 shower gels which sound perfect for summer -  Original Source Hibiscus & Pomegranate Tea ,  Vanilla & Raspberry , and  Skin Quench Cherry & Jojoba Oil . These shower gels are also suitable for vegans - they're approved by the Vegan Society. 
 You can find Original Source shower gels in most supermarkets and drugstores where the  250ml  bottles retail for Â£2 to Â£2.30. Or you can pick them up for  Â£1  or less (bargain stores, special offers). Now onto the reviews! 
 
 Original Source Hibiscus & Pomegranate Tea  is very nice. It smells of tea, red fruits and exotic flowers. Despite the 'red' fragrance this shower gel is actually refreshing. I think it's one of the best limited editions Original Source ever did! 
 Original Source Vanilla & Raspberry  sounds great - but it's not. From the bottle it smells like raspberry ice cream, but as soon as you start to lather it up on your skin, the ice cream fragrance disappears, and the shower gel starts to smell like candle wax. The only good thing about this shower gel is that it doesn't feel drying. However, since I don't want to shower with anything that smells like candle wax, this shower gel will end up in the hand soap dispenser in the kitchenâ€¦ 
 Original Source Skin Quench Cherry & Jojoba Oil  is really good. This shower gel is very moisturising (those jojoba oil beads really work), and it smells like boiled cherry sweets. Awesome fun! 
 Have you tried any of these shower gels, or would you like to try them? Feel free to get in touch via the comments. And thanks for reading. ðŸ™‚

 Hmm the Hibiscus & Pomegranate Tea sounds like my cup of tea! ðŸ˜‰ And of course, it's limited edition! Too bad the Vanilla & Raspberry one isn't good.
