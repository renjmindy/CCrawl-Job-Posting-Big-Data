  4 Ways To Keep Your Job Search Going During The Summer

 Every season is job search season if you want it bad enough. 
 However, there are some that view summer as a time of rest and ease up on their job searches.  That's the last thing you should do! 
 
 Sure, you should take time to relax and go on vacation—just don't abandon your job search goals completely. Here are four ways to keep your job search on track, while still enjoying your summer. 
 Update Your Resume & LinkedIn Profile 
 A new season is a time for renewal, so it's important to make sure your resume and LinkedIn profile are current and up-to-date with projects, contributions, and achievements. Summer is a great time for reflecting on the work you have done over recent months and leveraging those accomplishments to have a focused-driven resume and LinkedIn profile. 
 While your resume takes precedence, you should still  give your LinkedIn profile a good look  because it's public and is viewable by a greater geographic population.  Do not underestimate the power of LinkedIn for your job search potential   . 
 Attend Networking Events 
 Summer is a great time to be more social. Attend professional events, business happy hours, and ramp up your networking opportunities. Connect with old colleagues over lunch outdoors in casual attire, and seek out the potential for  informational interviews  at companies. Since things are more casual and laid back in the summertime, ramp up the opportunities and seize them. 
 Depending on your location, COVID-19 restrictions may impact networking events. However, there will still be ample opportunity to network online! 
 Refocus Your Strategy By Volunteering 
 The beautiful summer weather is great motivation for engaging in new volunteer and  community service  opportunities. Consider the potential for making new contacts and adding volunteer projects to your resume and LinkedIn profile that you are already updating during the summertime. 
 If COVID-19 impacts volunteer opportunities, try to find other ways to utilize your time.  Remember, summer days are longer. Use your time wisely, and to your benefit! 
 Re-Evaluate And Reach Out 
 Spend the summer re-evaluating your current role. What skills are you generating through your current role? What skills do you want to build upon? Consider reaching out to recruiters or your professional network, people who can help bring your next role into fruition. LinkedIn is a great resource for  connecting with recruiters  and seeing if new projects or opportunities are available to expand your skills. 
 Don't let the summer weather be a distraction or setback for you. Focus on reclaiming your brand, take a break or a vacation, and regroup on where you would like to go next in your career.  Remember one important thing: the year is already halfway over, so it's important to seize the moment, and the opportunity.
