 I am seeking an experienced Credit Controller for my well-established Black Country client. Based in West Bromwich, they have a strong history in the manufacturing sector, and recent growth has led them to create a new role to support their Accounts Receivable function. Salary for this role is £21-24k per annum, depending on experience. 
 The Role 
 This is a great opportunity for someone wishing to make an instant impact in a busy finance team. 
 It's a role that offers an opportunity to utilise all your cash collection, query resolution and accounts administration skills. This business has grown significantly in the last few years, and now seeks additional resource in their Accounts Receivable team to manage the increasing volume of overdues and associated queries. 
 Specifically we seek a candidate with the following skills and attributes: 
 - experienced in all aspects of chasing overdue accounts via phone, email and other legal correspondence. 
 - account reconciliations 
 - cash allocation 
 - dealing with account administration 
 - monitoring varying levels of risk across the ledger 
 - liaising with internal managers to ensure billing issues are resolved quickly and accurately 
 - updating customer accounts 
 - good Excel knowledge 
 This is a great opportunity for a candidate with a passion for credit control, query resolution and complex reconciliations, ideally with experience in a deadline-driven environment, where attention to detail is a vital attribute. You'll have your own customer accounts, with plenty of scope to manage your own time and priorities. 
 Please call Jo Payne ASAP to discuss on 07813 608579. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
