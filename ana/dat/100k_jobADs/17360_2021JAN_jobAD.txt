 Clojure developers of all levels to support back end data processing pipelines and ClojureScript web apps. 
 Role overview 
 We're hiring Clojure developers of all levels of experience to support our back end data processing pipelines, as well as ClojureScript web apps. Our current tech stack includes: 
 
 Integrant-based server side apps in Clojure 
 Parsing and validation of API outputs with Spec 
 Jackdaw for stream processing on Kafka 
 ClojureScript front-ends with re-frame 
 Postgres databases with hundreds of millions of interesting events 
 
 We're looking for people to join teams working on any or all aspects of this stack, as well as more senior engineers who are able to: 
 
 Mentor junior team members 
 Demonstrate and evangelise best practices in Clojure and beyond 
 Cross-train programmers with JavaScript & React experience 
 Keep an eye on new ideas and libraries in the Clojure ecosystem 
 
 Our teams also work in JavaScript and Node.js, Python for machine learning, and SQL and R for ad-hoc analysis, so knowledge or at least tolerance of those technologies would be a plus.
