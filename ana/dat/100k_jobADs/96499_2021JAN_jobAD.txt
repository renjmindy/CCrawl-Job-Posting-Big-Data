 You Know You're an Elem.Ed. Teacher When… 
 29 November 201729 November 2017   Tessa 
 You get grammar songs stuck in your head. Overnight. You arrive at work in the dark, and leave in the dark, and are still taking grading home. Eating alone is a privilege. You carry your phone in your pocket as much as possible because it counts your steps and that's the most exercise you're ever…  Continue reading You Know You're an Elem.Ed. Teacher When…

 Once again 
 25 January 2017   Tessa 
 It seems that it's that time of year again. I've fought the last month or so of going stir crazy quite well, I think. No crazy hair cuts (yet), no running away, no bad poetry written.

 Reflecting on 2014 
 15 December 201415 December 2014   Tessa 
 We're just now half way through December and I've already seen an increasing number of resolutions posts cropping up on all sorts of social media.

 Achievement 
 22 October 201422 November 2014   Tessa 
 Achievement means something quite different to me than it did when I was a bit younger. As a 23 year old my recent achievements are few and far between: graduating university, getting a salaried job that leaves me responsible for 16 second graders, paying my own rent, bills, car repairs, the whole nine yards.
