 Career Discovery week insights: The Lidl graduate programme through the eyes of a graduate - Part 2 
 It’s vital to hear about a graduate programme from the decision makers and those who run the programme, but it’s also important to hear from those who have experienced it first-hand, the graduates themselves. 
 In a three-part series of blogs, we will look at the Lidl graduate programme through the eyes of the graduates who have completed the programme and have been offered positions upon completion. 
 In fact, to date 100% of graduates on the 2018/2019 Lidl graduate programme have been offered a role in project manager positions. 
 In this blog we will hear from  Aoibheann Maddy  about her graduate journey through the Human Resources stream of the Lidl graduate programme. 
 Name: 
 Aoibheann Maddy 
 Third level institution: 
 Technological University Dublin 
 Degree: 
 Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Human Resource Management 
 When did you join the Lidl graduate programme? 
 September 2018 
 Current role: 
 Recruitment and Employer Brand- Project Manager 
 IN DETAIL: 
 How did you decide what you wanted to do after completing your degree and why did you then decide to apply for the Lidl graduate programme? 
 " When looking at what I wanted to do after college, I decided to go to the RDS gradIreland fair to try find out more information from different companies. I started talking to one of the graduates who was on the Lidl Graduate Programme in the HR stream and from that moment I was sold! " 
 " I was always looking for a company with excellent training and development whilst at the same time, giving their graduates real responsibility from the get-go. From my conversation at the Lidl stand, it was clear that they were going to offer exactly that." 
 What made the programme stand out from others for you? 
 "Lidl provides a perfect blend between working in a fast-paced environment, while also  providing exceptional support through mentoring and coaching opportunities throughout the 18 months. It is the best career decision I have made. " 
 How has the programme benefited you? 
 " As a HR graduate, I really feel I benefitted from experiencing the type of environment  o  ur colleagues work in and the nature of the work in store. While on the programme, I was fortunate to have been given the opportunity to work in a number of stores and in doing so I decided to hone in on the level of training that’s on offer for employees, particularly focusing on topics such as engagement and retention levels. " 
 What is one of the best aspects of the programme? 
 " Upon completing my store training, I was back in our head office in Tallaght and the opportunities didn’t stop. Not only was I able to experience working in each department within HR, but I also had the opportunity to be involved in a number of projects which, if it wasn’t for Lidl’s Graduate Programme, I would have never been able to do. It was really beneficial to bring the knowledge and the connections back from my store training and I saw how this had a positive impact on my projects."
