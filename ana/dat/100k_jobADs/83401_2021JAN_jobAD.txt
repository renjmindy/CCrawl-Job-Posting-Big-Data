 New job = old job 
 30. September 201530. September 2015  /  stefanienolte 
 Since March 2014 I worked at the  Applied plant ecology group  of Prof. Kai Jensen at the University of Hamburg. The position was funded via the  INTERFACE  project, for which we applied in 2013. Since my colleague Antonia Wanner left our group in the beginning of 2014 I took over managing the project together with my colleague Andreas Dänhardt of the Institute for Hydrobiology and Fisheries Science. 
 Now I got the opportunity to get a university position here within group. This means that I will be able to keep supervising the two PhD-students in the INTERFACE project, but I will also be able to start new projects and establish my own lab. I am really grateful for this opportunity! Already another PhD-student joined the team: Dennis Schulze just started a project investigating the effect of grazing on sediment deposition and accretion in salt marshes. However, next to more opportunities for research, the new position also brings some more teaching with it. But, I am looking forward to this too, as it will enable me to broaden my experience … and to find good students for projects. 
 So, thanks to everybody who supported me this far! Here’s to three more years in Hamburg!
