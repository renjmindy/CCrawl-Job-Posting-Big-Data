  Job Seekers: Never Do This On Mondays  
 J.T. O'Donnell 
 April 01, 2013 
 There is one rule I always tell  job seekers  about job search activities on a Monday: Never, I mean never, call to check the status of your application, or where the hiring manager is in the decision-making process for a job on a Monday. 
 
 Here Is Why... 
 Mondays are the least popular day of the work week. Even the most cheerful of workers struggles to get in the groove on a  Monday . Given 84% of Americans surveyed last year said they would like a new job, it’s safe to say the majority of people are not in the best mood. Adding stress or pressure to their day is not going to help you. So, as much as you are dying to know where you stand, I would suggest waiting until later in the week for several reasons: 
 
 If the hiring manager hasn’t made any progress, they will not appreciate you reminding them. 
 If you are not in the running, they will not be thrilled about having to give you the bad news. 
 If they are super busy and planned to address the hiring process later in the week, they will not appreciate you trying to push them to address it sooner. 
 
 Ironically, all that can change on a Tuesday when they are organized for the week and back in the  productivity  zone. Why? I do not know, but trust me when I say job seekers should spend Mondays researching companies and identifying who they want to network with. Save the actually calling for Tuesdays and you will see people will be in better moods and respond to you more positively. Now you know to never do this on Mondays.
