 Interview Following Up 
 
 Signs that your interview went well 
 These signs can help you feel confident that you’re being seriously considered. 
 Dawn Papandrea, Monster contributor 
 Are they already envisioning you in the job? 
 Going on a job interview can be an exciting but also stressful experience. You spend hours researching the company, preparing smart answers for the  tough questions , choosing an outfit, and keeping your cool throughout the actual interview. And in the aftermath, wondering how you really did is perhaps even more nerve-wracking. Luckily, there are some clues that might indicate your performance. This is how to know if an interview went well. 
 If you get a good vibe 
 Never underestimate what your gut feeling is telling you. If you felt a strong, positive connection, it's probably not your imagination. Some conversations can feel  very uncomfortable , while others are very natural and flow smoothly. 
 Even during interviews that are designed to rattle you a bit, you can still get a sense that you did well based on the energy in the room. Did you notice the interviewer smiling and nodding? Did the interviewer stray into casual conversation where you discussed some things in common? Was everyone upbeat? In some cases, an interviewer may even pay you a compliment, which is always a good thing. 
 Not-so-good:  If the interviewer looks uninterested, distracted, or even  combative . 
 If you 're taken on a tour of the office 
 Usually if you are walked around to see where you'd be sitting, get to check out the break room, and end up meeting some of the staff, that's a good thing. If you had absolutely no chance, there would be no reason for the hiring manager to bring you around. 
 Not-so-good:  If your interview ends and you're escorted straight to the exit, it doesn't mean you won't get the job, but it's not the best sign. 
 If additional people are brought in to meet you 
 If you're wondering how to know if an interview went well, keep track of how many people you meet. While it's normal at some companies to meet with more than one person, if the formal interview portion seems like it's finished and then other members of the team are brought in so they can simply meet you, take that as a good sign. 
 Not-so-good:  If you were supposed to meet with more than one person, but then your main interviewer says that the second person is unable to join, it could be legitimate, or it could mean that you didn't get past the screening. 
 If the interviewer talks to you as if you already have the job 
 The language being used can sometimes offer clues. For example, look at the difference between this phrasing: "When you start, your training will last three days," versus, "New hires have three days of training." If the interviewer is already referring to you as an employee, it can mean that they already envision you in the job. 
 Not-so-good:  If they seem cold or overly formal and not conversational in the least, it could just be a personality quirk or interview tactic. Or, it could mean that there wasn't a strong connection. 
 If you 're asked, "When can you start?" 
 Usually that's another way of them saying that the job is yours when you're ready. In most cases, you wouldn't get that question posed to you if you didn't have a legitimate shot at the role. 
 Not-so-good:  If they say something like, "We're not really sure when the job would actually start," that's a red flag that you're not being seriously considered (or they are a disorganized mess). Either way, not good. 
 If it takes a long time 
 While going through a long interview process isn't necessarily a guarantee that the job is yours, you can take it as a good sign that you're at least in the running. A company is not going to invest a significant amount of time in a candidate if they aren't a potential fit. If you were expecting to chat for a half hour and you're there for two hours, add another check in the "I may land this job" column. 
 Not-so-good:  If you're asked a few brief questions and then it's over abruptly, it could mean they didn't like the way you answered something, or that there is someone else who was a better fit. 
 If it feels like they 're trying to pitch you 
 Having a company try to sell themselves to you as an employer usually means they probably want you for the role. They wouldn't spend time spelling out all of the reasons why it's a  great place to work , and sharing details about their benefits and culture, if you were a mediocre candidate. 
 Not-so-good:  While it's a more subtle sign to pick up on, if the interviewer focuses on the negative parts of the job, or says something like "this isn't for everyone," that could very well mean they don't think it's for you. 
 If they ask about other offers you 're entertaining 
 Usually if an interviewer starts probing you about your job search, it means they are concerned that another company is going to snag you first. They might ask in a subtle way, such as, "How's your job search going?" or they might come right out and ask, "Are you considering any other offers?" Either way, this usually means that your interview made a great impression and they know that there may be some competition. 
 Not-so-good:  If it's mentioned that so many other candidates are vying for the position, that might be their way of lowering your expectations. 
 If they have a definitive plan for what 's next 
 If you didn't wow your interviewer, they might say something like, "We have a lot of other candidates to consider, so we'll be in touch." But, if your meeting ends and they say something like, "You'll be hearing from us within three days," or, "When can you come in to meet with our CEO?", you can feel confident that you're being seriously considered. 
 Not-so-good:  If you're told to follow up with an assistant if you don't hear back, it's almost as if the hiring manager doesn't want to spend any more time with you.
