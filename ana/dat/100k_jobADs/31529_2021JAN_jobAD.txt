  The 7-Day Job Search [Webinar]  
 Work It Daily 
 March 17, 2014 
 Did you know that the typical job search takes six months? Depending on who you ask, it can take even longer. Some experts even believe that it takes one month for every $10,000 you bring home. So, in theory, if you want to earn $80,000 annually you should set aside eight months to find your next role. That’s a lot of time! Lucky for you, there's no reason why finding a job has to take six months. Sure, anything worth having is worth the wait but why stick around when you can act. In fact, you can get the ball rolling and make considerable progress in just one week. Your host, Michael Peggs, will walk you through a 7-day job search plan. You will receive a different task for each day that will help you get a little closer to landing a job. You don't want to miss out on this jam-packed session!
