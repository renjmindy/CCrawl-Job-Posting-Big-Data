 Looking for the best website testing jobs? Want to get paid to test websites and apps? If yes, keep reading this article. 
 I am sure you have bumped into blogs, apps, and websites that are just unfriendly to use. I am also sure you have bumped into some that are just excellent and you had a great experience. 
 Poor navigability, crappy content, lack of clarity, and poor designs are some of the factors that make a website user-unfriendly. 
 What do you do when you bump into such websites and apps? My guess is you instantly leave and find another user-friendly website. 
 Now, this is one of a website owner's nightmares. No website owner or blogger wants visitors to leave their site for another. 
 To make sure websites and apps are user-friendly, and keep attracting visitors instead of repelling them, website owners hire a third party to give their views. The website owners will then use these reviews to improve the usability of their sites. 
 So, in simpler terms, website testing jobs entail giving reviews of websites, and sometimes app, to improve their usability. 
 If this sounds like something you would love to venture into, read this article to the last full stop.
