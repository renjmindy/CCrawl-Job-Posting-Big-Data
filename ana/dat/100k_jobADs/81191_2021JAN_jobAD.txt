 Join my CM Team  to earn while you share the magic of photos and the connections they create. 
 When you sign up as a  CM Advisor , you'll have the opportunity to earn Retail Profits on your sales of CM products, as well as Commissions on sales of Advisors who sign under you. There is a fee (currently set at $49.00) which Advisors must pay when signing up, and annually thereafter, to cover the ongoing cost of producing and maintaining the Sales Tools. This is the only mandatory amount payable to join as an Advisor. Upon payment of the Annual Fee, your account will be activated and you can set up your personal link. You'll also have access to the Advisor Tools which include images you can post on your website, your Facebook page, send via email or share any way you wish. When a visitor follows your link and makes a purchase, we'll keep track and you'll earn a percentage (Retail Profit) of the sale. People can also follow your link to sign up as an Advisor under you.
