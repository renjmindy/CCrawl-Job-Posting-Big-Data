 Otravo is a leading European online travel organization. With our brands we enable travelers in over 50 countries to enjoy saving money while booking their flight tickets and holiday packages. We work closely with our partners like airlines, tour operators, hotels, car rentals, insurance companies etc. This way we guarantee our customers a complete and competitive offer. We make the shopping and booking process as easy, quick and enjoyable as possible. And with success: we process over 3 million reservations per year. Otravo was established at the start of 2014 by the merger of Vliegtickets and WTC and added Schipholtickets to its brands in December 2015. In February 2016 Waterland Private Equity took a majority shareholding in the company, with the objective to become a leading European Online Travel Agency through the combination of internal growth and acquisitions. This led to the acquisitions of Flygstolen (Nordics) in July 2016, VakantieDiscounter (Benelux, Packages) in February 2017 and Interneto Partneris (Baltics) in October 2017. In May 2018 Travelgenio was added, which means Otravo now sells over 3 million trips/holidays per year, generating close to 2 billion EUR in gross Sales.
