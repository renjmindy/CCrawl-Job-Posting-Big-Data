 In a  recent episode  of  JT Talks Jobs  , we talked about the questions you should be prepared to answer post-crisis. So, now it's time to flip the script and tell you what questions YOU should ask in a job interview after the crisis subsides. 
 "What I want you to remember is that what you ask is just as important as what you say. 30% of how well you're going to do in this interview is going to come down to the kinds of questions you ask." These questions will help show hiring managers your intellect, humility, and emotional intelligence. If you want to stand out in a highly competitive job market, these are the questions to ask.

  Post-Crisis Interview Questions: What They Are & How To Answer Them  
 J.T. O'Donnell 
 Work It Daily 
 June 10, 2020 
   
 COVID-19 is changing a lot of things in the world, and it will change the way job seekers prepare for interviews. When hiring new employees, employers will be asking different questions and looking for different answers than they previously did. 
 "When you start to go out and interview, you're going to get asked questions, and when you can convey these things through your answers, you are going to improve the chances that you get chosen for the job because you are giving off the persona (the professional presence) that's going to give employers the confidence and trust to hire you." Here are some key questions employers will ask post-COVID and how job seekers can successfully answer them.

  The Skill That Will Help You Land A Job Post-Crisis  
 J.T. O'Donnell 
 Work It Daily 
 June 09, 2020 
   
 After this crisis subsides, there will be a huge shift in the way employers hire. There will be a lot of supply, but not enough demand for jobs. So, how do you stand out from the other candidates? 
 "There will be a lot fewer jobs post-crisis, which will drive up the competition between job seekers. So if that's the case, now employers will have to have criteria in order to choose." There's one skill that can help you stand out from the competition. In this episode, I discuss what that skill is, and how you can develop it now.

  Two Tests That Will Help You Plan Your Next Career Move  
 J.T. O'Donnell 
 Work It Daily 
 June 09, 2020 
   
 You may be thinking of making your next career move. If you want to make that move successfully, it's important to know which of your strengths to play to. So, how exactly do you find that out? 
 "You are a business-of-one. If you think of yourself as a business-of-one, any good business has a clear sense of what their strengths are and what they should be marketing about themselves. By knowing that, it makes it easier for them to dial in and target the market they want to go after." In this episode, I talk about two simple (and free) tests you can take that will help you determine your next career move.

  Why Laid-Off Employees Should Ask About Outplacement  
 J.T. O'Donnell 
 Work It Daily 
 June 08, 2020 
   
 Companies in various industries have been forced to lay off employees, and more companies will have to do the same soon. While outplacement services can't stop them from letting you go, it can help you get back on your feet. 
 "If you have been let go, even temporarily, you should be requesting outplacement." Here's what outplacement is, why anyone in danger of being laid off should push for it, and what you should do if you've already been laid off.

 J.T. O'Donnell 
 Work It Daily 
 April 23, 2020 
   
 Once companies start hiring again after COVID-19, there will be a LOT of competition for jobs. There will be people with the same experience, same degrees, and same hard skills competing for the same job. So, how will you stand out from the competition? 
 "I can sit there and tell you 'technology, big and important', 'being fast on a computer, really important' \- but when it comes to getting the job, it will be about the soft skills because there's too much competition and too many people with the same hard skills." There are 5 key skills that you can develop to stand out from other candidates. In this episode, I break down what those skills are and why they're so important to master if you want to land a job after COVID-19.

  What To Do If You Can’t Pay Your Mortgage Due To Coronavirus  
 J.T. O'Donnell 
 Work It Daily 
 April 23, 2020 
   
 As layoffs continue in waves, many people are wondering how they'll make ends meet and manage their expenses. One of those expenses could be a mortgage. What should you do if you can no longer afford it? 
 "The average American has less than $400 in savings. People are really living paycheck to paycheck, and so they are really concerned. They're thinking, "what am I going to do?" And one of the first things they should do is look at their budget - where are their assets? What are their monthly payments? What's the cashflow that's going out?" \- Todd Palmer In this bonus episode, I talk with mortgage executive and Work It Daily executive member, Todd Palmer, about options for those concerned about their mortgage payment during this crisis. Come join the conversation and learn what you need to know. Todd's article on the topic:  https://www.workitdaily.com/cant-pay-your-mortgage-options   Connect with Todd on LinkedIn:  https://www.linkedin.com/in/toddpalmer0/   HPF's HOPE Hotline: 888-995-4673 ( https://995hope.org/ ) Want To Hear More?
