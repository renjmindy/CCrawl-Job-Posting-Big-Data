 hi 
 I came upon an article about finding caregiver or nanny jobs abroad,  http://www.workcaregiver.com/caregiver-jobs-in-canada/caregiver-jobs-in-abroad/  and I am very interested to apply… 
 I am currently an au pair in Switzerland but I am a Filipino citizen. If I can find an employer abroad, is it possible for me to go overseas from Switzerland to another country like Canada without going back to the Philippines, when my visa expires here ?.. if possible , may I have some ideas how it works…? 
 Any information is very much appreciated. Thank you. 
 -Janine
