 Tourism and Hospitality Jobs in Ireland 
 Set out on an adventure with a tourism or hospitality job in Ireland! 
 Would you like to finally try out what it feels like to live and work abroad? In Ireland we can help you to land jobs for 4-12 weeks, offering you free accommodation and meals in exchange for work in hotels, theme parks, bed and breakfasts, travel agencies and other tourism providers on the Green Island! 
 Working in Ireland will help you to get more independent and to gain valuable experience for your future studies or training in the tourism sector. 
 Ireland is renowned for its céad míle fáilte, which literally means "a hundred thousand welcomes". Did you know that about 11 million tourists visit Ireland every year? That's more than twice the population of the island! The Irish hospitality is a major factor and ensures that visitors will remember their stay in a positive way. 
 And where better to learn how to welcome visitors and direct them where to go in a new place than a country whose very personal welcome is known all around the world? Imagine strolling through the quaint alleys of an Irish town. Street musicians fill the streets with happy sounds and in the cafés, people enjoy delicious scones and freshly brewed coffee. Do you love music and can't get enough of Irish culture? The Irish love to celebrate! Whether it’s culture, music, art, culinary or literature - one festival follows the next here, especially during the summer months. 
 Nature lovers will not miss out in Ireland either: The Green Island is breathtakingly diverse and full of fascinating natural landscapes. How many shades of green can there actually be on one single island? How refreshing can a light summer rain feel, which in Ireland is referred to as “liquid sunshine”? Picturesque sandy beaches on the coast invite you to take long walks. In addition to scenic villages and dreamy ruins, you will find dramatic coastal panoramas and imposing cliffs that drop almost vertically into the sea. A spectacular sight! During the summer months, bold swimmers and surfers enjoy Ireland’s sea and beaches. Did you know that the Irish coasts are known for their fantastic waves by surfers all over the world? 
 What is the job about? 
 Tourism and gastronomy in Ireland are diverse and businesses range from small to large. We facilitate short-term jobs of up to 12 weeks in duration with various providers in the field of tourism, food service and hospitality, including tourism associations, travel agencies, tour, sports and adventure tourism providers (e.g. windsurfing, canoeing), hotels, hostels, B&Bs, farms providing guest rooms ("agritourism"), bars, restaurants, in food and beverage production as well as in event management and transportation. 
 Let us know the areas that interest you the most and we will match you with a job that perfectly fits your interests and skills! 
 The jobs are unpaid, but you will typically get free accommodation and meals from your workplace in exchange for your work. We will inform you about the exact conditions before you confirm your booking! 
 How can you get involved? 
 The main tourist season in Ireland is from around March to late September. During this time local and foreign tourists visit the numerous sights and fascinating natural sites of the Green Island. Come to Ireland during this time if you want to get to know the busy main tourist season, where there is always a lot to do! 
 You don't have time during peak season, but still want to work in Ireland? No problem! Tourism jobs are available all year round in Ireland: many hotels offer special spa and wellness packages during the cooler season, which are intended to attract local tourists as well as guests from abroad. Travel agencies and tourism providers also offer seasonal offers. We make sure there will be enough for you to do and experience during your stay in Ireland so you definitely won't get bored! 
 Areas of exposure could include: 
 
 In  hotels  ,  hostels  ,  B &Bs  or  farms offering guest rooms  you may be working at the front desk, assist international guests in your language and in English, and checking them into their rooms. You may also work in the kitchen or in service and help prepare or serve dishes. 
 In  restaurants  , you may prepare tables, advise guests on food and drinks, serve meals, check the tables for cleanliness, and accept table reservations. 
 With  outdoor sports providers  , you may help with maintaining the equipment, e.g. wetsuits or canoes, supports the trainers in guiding the activities and helps customers to put on the safety equipment correctly. 
 With  travel providers  you may help the team create travel itineraries, get involved in online marketing, advise customers on their travel activities and update booking platforms. 
 
 Working in Ireland will not only allow you to travel abroad and get international experience, but you will also acquire practical skills that can be extremely valuable for your resume or your future studies / training! Another great side effect: while working in Ireland, you will improve your English skills by speaking the language in your daily life, i.e. with your local colleagues! 
 What are your working times? 
 You will work 5 days a week for about 40-45 hours and have 2 days off a week. Since there is always a lot to do in tourism and hospitality, especially in the high season, your days off do not necessarily fall on the weekends. If you work on the weekends, you will have days off during the week instead. 
 The exact working hours depend on your job and can vary - depending on the tasks to be done! Being flexible and a hands-on mentality are key skills if you would like to gain a foothold in the tourism industry. 
 What previous knowledge do you need? 
 No knowledge or previous work experience is required. 
 Of course, if you already have experience, this won't hurt either. If you are looking for an internship for your studies or vocational training in tourism, gastronomy or travel, our placements are a perfect match for you, too: Let us know the requirements of your university / school for the internship and we will find a suitable placement for you. During the entire internship, you will be guided and supervised by experts from your area of interest, to make sure you’ll have the best possible learning effect! 
 Internship is also possible! 
 If you are looking for an internship for your school/vocational training/college/highschool you have come to the right place: Tell us the requirements of training institute and we will find a suitable internship for you at a tourism or hospitality company in Ireland. During the entire internship, you will be guided and supervised by a professional from your field of study so that you have the greatest possible learning effect.
