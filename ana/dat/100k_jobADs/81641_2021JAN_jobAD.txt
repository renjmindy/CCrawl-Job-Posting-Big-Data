 My client, a division of a FTSE 100 is looking for a finance business partner on a 6 month contract. This is an exciting opportunity to join a growing business that offers a global solution in an expanding sector. 
 The role provides financial reporting support to the financial controller and is responsible for forecasting performance against budget and the production of the management accounts. Other deliverables include variance analysis, flash reporting and developing business performance drivers such as profit reporting, revenue against headcount and contract profitability. Finally, this role involves working with a number of stakeholders, including non-finance at the manager and director level. 
 The successful candidate will be either qualified or late stage studier with significant business partnering experience. You will be an strong communicator both written and verbal, able to explain complex finance concepts to non finance staff and challenge where appropriate. Ideally, you will have worked in a large, complex, matrix structure and understand the need for working relationships with other parts of the business. This is a hands on role that will suit a proactive, independent individual who is keep to further their career. Following the 6 month initial contract there is potential for the role to become permanent within this division or another part of the organisation.
