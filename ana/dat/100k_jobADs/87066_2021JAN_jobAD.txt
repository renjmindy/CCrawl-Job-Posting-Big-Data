 Front-end developer with Craft CMS experience LOCALCONTRACT 
 Job Description 
 A young and dynamic start-up is currently looking for a Craft & front-end developer to help to improve our website (E-commerce platform) and potentially longer term projects. 
 The figure we are searching should have experience in Craft CMS including plugin development, Yii framework/PHP, React, SASS and Git. E-Commerce or Design experience is a plus, but not a must. 
 We are considering different options for collaboration: full-time employee, freelance, remote/on site, so we are quite flexible. If you prefer working remotely, please note that there will be occasional meetings on site (Europe/Germany).
