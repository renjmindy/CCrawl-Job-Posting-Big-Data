 Top free job posting sites for employers 
 Nikoletta Bika 
 Senior Content Writer 
 
 Free job posting sites are an essential part of a healthy recruiting strategy: getting a few good candidates for zero dollars is a  pretty good deal . The secret is to  write a great job description  and choose the right places to get it live. 
 So where can you post job openings for free? Here are the top free job posting sites for employers and a short FAQ at the end to help you better build your job posting strategies: 
 With Workable, you can post to dozens of free and premium job boards with a single click. Get a demo  or start a free trial to learn how. 
 Adzuna 
 Adzuna  started in the UK and has become one of the most popular global job boards visited by millions of candidates every month. You can post one job for free to try out this platform. Also, check out Adzuna’s local branches to target candidates in your location. 
 Craigslist 
 Craigslist  is a US-based classified ads site where you can also advertise your jobs. If you want to post jobs for free on Craigslist, be sure to check if there are fees in your area since Craigslist  charges employers in some locations  (e.g. San Francisco). 
 Glassdoor 
 Glassdoor offers a seven-day trial where you can  post your jobs for free . To fully benefit from Glassdoor services, start by creating a free employer account; you can upgrade to premium later for better features. 
 Google for Jobs 
 Google for Jobs can give a significant boost to your job ads. As one of Google’s enhanced search features, Google for Jobs gathers job postings from job sites and  careers pages  and shows them in Google Search. Here’s how to  encourage this tool to pick up your job ads . 
 Indeed Free 
 Indeed  is so popular you might wonder: is it free to post a job on indeed? Yes, you can get good candidates through its free job posting options. If you need more talent later, buy a sponsored posting to increase the visibility of your job advert. If you’re wondering how to post a job on Indeed for free,  see our complete tutorial . 
 Indeed Organic 
 This is Indeed’s search engine at work: it searches for job ads that meet certain criteria and pulls them automatically from your careers page or other job sites. To benefit from this feature, make sure you  write transparent and attractive job descriptions . 
 With Workable, you can post to 18+ job boards (including Monster, Glassdoor, CareerBuilder and more) with a single submission.  Try it free . 
 Jobcase 
 On  Jobcase , you can advertise jobs for hourly workers. If you’re a hiring manager, you can post a job for free, while external recruiters and agencies must choose a paid plan. This job site is also part of a network that includes  JobTree  and  Craigslist . 
 Jora 
 Jora  is a job aggregator with a global presence, where you can post jobs for free. Jora also partners with other platforms in different areas, such as SEEK in Australia and New Zealand and JobStreet in Asia. 
 PostJobFree 
 You can use Florida-founded  PostJobFree  to, well, post jobs for free. This job site also has premium services to help you find more candidates (for example, by promoting your job ad on other job boards). 
 SimplyHired 
 SimplyHired  recently became part of Indeed’s parent company, Recruit Holdings, and remains one of the most popular free job posting boards and search engines. As an employer, you can post jobs for free and take advantage of SimplyHired’s network of more than 100 job boards. 
 Workable job board 
 Our very own  job board  shows any job ad published using our system. It’s free, it’s global and it helps you expand your advertising reach while candidates enjoy the ease of applying through Workable. 
 ZipRecruiter 
 ZipRecruiter offers one job slot during a 5-day free trial. If you’ve attracted enough good candidates before the end of the trial period, you can cancel the job posting. Or, you can select a paid plan to keep your job posting published and get even more qualified candidates. 
 Using any of these free posting sites will help you reach out to your candidates (and maybe your future hires). To enhance your job posting strategies, check out our  most updated list of specialized job boards, local job boards and premium sites  that complements this list of free job posting sites. 
 If you have more questions about job posting, check out our short FAQ: 
 How do you post a job on Indeed? 
 If you’re ready to use a free job posting on indeed, go to  Indeed’s page for employers , and click the “post job” button. You can then log in to Indeed or create a free employer account if you don’t have one yet. From there, the job posting process is fairly straightforward –  see our tutorial for the next steps . Note that Indeed automatically generates  company pages  when pulling job ads from other job boards or careers pages. Check if there is one for your company and claim it to add more information or graphics. 
 Is ZipRecruiter free to post jobs? 
 As we mentioned above, ZipRecruiter lets you post a job for free during the free trial. However, if you’re posting your jobs via Workable’s talent acquisition software, you can post on ZipRecruiter for free. Premium ZipRecruiter is also available via Workable if you want to promote your jobs to ZipRecruiter’s associate job sites, too, with one submission. 
 Can you post jobs on Facebook? 
 There are multiple ways to post and promote your job ads on Facebook. You can post an open role on your Facebook page as a status update or share it in a relevant group. You can turn any Facebook post into a sponsored post to target your job ad to a specific audience – just click the “Boost Post” button when creating the update. You can also use the  Job Ads tab  on your company’s Facebook page to display job openings that are already published. See more about  how to post and boost your Facebook job ad  in our complete tutorial. 
 If you want to get qualified candidates fast, you could also opt for  Workable Campaigns : this AI-powered tool finds candidates who are a good fit for your job description and shows your job ad to them on Facebook and Instagram. 
 Are there any free job posting sites without registration? 
 There probably are; for example, some local classified ads sites may let you post jobs without creating an account. But that’s usually not a good sign about the quality of the site. Registration or some sort of verification is vital to enable a site to filter out scams or ads that don’t meet basic job posting requirements. This earns more trust from candidates and ensures legit employers will compete only with other legit employers. So don’t be afraid to create an account with job boards. It’ll take you a few minutes, but it’s time well invested as it benefits everyone in the end.
