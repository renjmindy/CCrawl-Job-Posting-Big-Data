 Spatial Economics MSc. (STREEM) at VU University Amsterdam

 STREEM alumnus Ilias 
 In my opinion, the  MSc. programme of Spatial, Transport and Environmental Economics (STREEM) of VU University  is on the top of the MSc. programmes in Europe for any Economics student with an interest in spatial (and special) topics. After having followed another Spatial Economics MSc. programme before I arrived in the Netherlands, my expectations were already quite high. And I only decided to get enrolled in VU after visiting the university and another university in Amsterdam to see with my own eyes. But I have to admit that STREEM exceeded my expectations. 
 Having a very good mix of senior and junior professors and researchers, this huge concentration of spatial economists provides students with the valuable insight of the more experienced and widely-acknowledged economists, together with the spark and the motivation of younger bright professors and researchers. In addition, as a member of the educational committee of the programme, I realised that the whole STREEM team makes a serious effort in improving the quality of the learning process using the feedback of the students; in collaboration with the professors. To be honest, it stroke me as pretty impressive. Other than the high level of teaching by the teaching staff, the teaching material and the whole programme structure, VU offers quite good connections to the job market. Career days which are useful, internships and online posts on job openings and vacancies. This is how I found the call for the PhD scholarship I am currently involved. Another thing to mention is the valuable advice about my career decisions from my supervisor and the support (recommendation letters) from other professors too. One final comment is that the  fees  are very reasonable and there are also some good opportunities for  working part-time  (not recommended; but could be needed) and getting  a study grant from the Dutch government (for EU citizens) . 
 All in all, I am really happy having chosen this master at VU. I am currently in the middle of my PhD in the University of Barcelona and at the moment I am visiting Brown University. Even after having attended some graduate classes in many different settings, I still believe that STREEM is a top choice. 
 Please hesitate to contact me if there is no need. My time is as valuable as yours.  ipasidis@ub.edu

 Why did I choose to study in the Netherlands? 
 During my studies at the Saint-Petersburg State University of Film and Television I was already a proactive and ambitious student, but I wanted something more in my life. Driven by the desire to develop myself and realize my potential, I have decided to apply for a master programme in the Netherlands. I felt that this is the right country for me to reach my goals. Getting to know Dutch people, visiting this country and starting learning Dutch at the Netherlands Institute in Saint-Petersburg made me completely fall in love with this country, its culture and its people.
