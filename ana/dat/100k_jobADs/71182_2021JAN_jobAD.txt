 Job application rejection email template 
 Use this job application rejection email template to inform candidates who’ve applied for one of your open roles that they will not advance to the next stage of your hiring process. 
 
 Avoid leaving job applicants guessing. When you screen candidates, make sure to inform those who don’t qualify that they will not move forward and thank them for their application. Communicate promptly during all your hiring stages to build a more  positive candidate experience . 
 If you’re rejecting applicants you haven’t interviewed, it’s best to keep your email simple and brief. Thank them for considering your company and prompt them to apply again in the future, if you think they might qualify for another job opening. Keep your tone professional yet polite, so that you  turn down candidates without burning bridges .
