 Role overview 
 Why us? 
 At RVU, we have the best of both worlds: the excitement of a start-up and the strength of well-established, trusted household names. 
 **  uSwitch  **is the UK‚Äôs top comparison website for home services switching helping consumers save money on their gas ‚õΩ, electricityüí°, broadband, TV üì∫ and phone ‚òéÔ∏è 
 **  Money ** is one of the UK‚Äôs leading comparison websites for financial services. Consumers can compare loans, credit cards, bank accounts and insurance from more than 600 providers. üí∏ 
 **  Bankrate ** is changing the mortgage market. We create innovative and personalised products that help you make smarter decisions. We want to empower you to find a house and get a mortgage without talking to an agent or broker. üè† 
 Together, we are RVU. Together, we have the power to reach consumers across the UK, and the technology to give them a world class online experience. 
 We believe in being great people to work with: we are very passionate about our own work, but we think that it‚Äôs important to make time to help others with their work - so that the entire team gets better every day. We are entrepreneurial - we believe in challenging the status quo and solving problems our users will face tomorrow. Perhaps most of all, we are inclusive: no matter who we are, where we come from, or which project we work on, we are one team with one dream: improving the lives of our users through awesome experiences. 
 The role 
 Our purpose is to simplify complex marketplaces with intuitive and accessible applications that genuinely improve people‚Äôs lives. Saving a few hundred pounds a year on bills makes a fundamental difference to vulnerable people who sometimes have to choose between paying for utilities or groceries üçå 
 Our platforms serve millions of users a month, process thousands of comparisons a day, and drive hundreds of complex integrations with vastly different partners. We‚Äôre a tech-driven business that focuses on agile delivery and cross functional product teams. 
 We are creating the next generation of comparison platforms, and as we scale we are looking for passionate, empathetic engineers to build highly performant, accessible, and beautiful consumer experiences to facilitate switching and comparisons on the web. üíª

 Building performance tooling to continuously improve our TTFB across the site, and optimising for a PWA experience with offline caching and push notifications 
 Creating beautiful dashboard experiences for our B2B products using D3.js and React 
 
 We pride ourselves in delivering accessible, performant, and functional experiences to the consumer, hopefully you do too.

 uSwitch

 uSwitch is an impartial comparison and switching service. We help compare prices on gas & electricity, home phone, broadband, digital television, mobile phones and personal finance products including mortgages, credit cards, current accounts and insurance. Our aim is to help customers take advantage of the best prices and services on offer from suppliers so they can get their best deal. As well as offering online and telephone-based comparison, Energy customers also have the option to create an account to automatically monitor the market and notify them when they can move to a cheaper tariff - making future comparisons even simpler and faster. Our Broadband speed test tool also helps customers find out how fast their broadband is and to identify the best broadband provider for their postcode. We‚Äôre based in London near London Bridge and Southwark Bridge and can boast a scenic view from our office of some amazing buildings such as the Shard, the Cheese Grater, Walkie-Talkie and the Gherkin. Our Culture Well we don‚Äôt like to boast, but our culture is quite unique. We empower intelligent people to make intelligent decisions. We give them the autonomy to experiment and the flexibility to develop ways to provide our customers a simple and personal service. We‚Äôre all extremely proud of working here and that shows through the commitment and the passion in every day life at uSwitch. We don‚Äôt believe in hierarchy and we‚Äôre not at all corporate. So in a nutshell we‚Äôre just what you‚Äôre looking for if you want to develop yourself and make a difference.
