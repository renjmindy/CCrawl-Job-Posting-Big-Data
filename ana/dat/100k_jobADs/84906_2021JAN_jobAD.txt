 REBECCA KILGORE and ECHOES OF SWING: "WINTER DAYS at SCHLOSS ELMAU" 
 Posted on  January 13, 2020  |  2 comments 
 Before writing this post, I was thinking about Rebecca (or Becky or Roo -- she has many names, as appropriate to a multi-faceted personality) someone I have been listening to with awe and pleasure since 1994, perhaps beginning with I SAW STARS (Arbors). As for Echoes of Swing, I got to hear them in person in Germany (in 2007, thanks to Manfred Selchow) and could tell them how I admired them. It's one of my dreams to have musicians and groups of musicians I revere play together, and the new CD is just such a dream. . . . one that you and I can hear and re-hear. 
 
 The disc also affords us a chance to adjust our perspectives, to shake off some preconceptions. Some listeners have perched Rebecca on a sunny windowsill in the country of Light, Bright, and Sparkling. Yes, she may prefer PICK YOURSELF UP to GLOOMY SUNDAY, but for me a little darkness will suffice. Hear her on this disc as she sails through I'VE GOT MY LOVE TO KEEP ME WARM and her reputation as an antidote to darkness is intact. But only shallow listeners will mistake optimism for shallowness: she has depths of feeling.

 Echoes of Swing has also been slightly mis-characterized, praised for their large orchestral sound (the core unit is four players, count them, four -- even though on this CD they add a string bass and guitar as well as Rebecca) -- as if they were somehow marvelous simply for this magic trick, and critics have heard them as successors to the John Kirby Sextet, which is both plausible and confining. But on this CD, the players -- whom I should name now: Bernd Lhotzky, piano and musical director; Colin T. Dawson, trumpet and flugelhorn; Chris Hopkins, alto saxophone; Oliver Mewes, drums, with Henning Gailing, string bass, and (on four tracks) Rolf Marx, guitar -- create such rich varied sounds inside and outside of the arrangements by Bernd and Chris that I felt as if I'd wandered into a universe scored by, let us say, Gil Evans, spacious and resonant. 
 Other artists have created records and CDs devoted to Winter. And many of those jolly efforts are avalanches of fake snow from the arts-and-crafts store. Christmas music looms, no matter how many chairs might be wedged against the studio door, or there's LET IT SNOW, the now-troublesome BABY, IT'S COLD OUTSIDE, or WINTER WEATHER. Sweet, certainly, but not always true to the reality of the season, for Winter is a time for introspection as the world becomes colder and darker. This disc, I assure you, is not a descent into Seasonal Affective Disorder, and there are a few familiar cheery songs on it, but it is not the usual forgettable fluff. 
 Here's a wonderful example, the text being the 1931 WINTER WONDERLAND, where the focused purity of Rebecca's voice balances against a complex, shifting orchestral background: 
 Bernd's quirkily cheerful setting of the most famous Robert Frost poem: 
 Rebecca's own witty and sweet song: 
 You'll have to explore the other surprises for yourself -- songs I'd never heard by Frishberg, Berlin, and Jobim, and a few poems set to music by Bernd -- performances that are remarkable on the first hearing and grow more so. 
 The disc is dense -- which is not to say difficult or off-putting -- but it has levels and levels of musical and emotional pleasure. Some discs make wonderful background music -- the soundtrack for rearranging one's spice rack -- but this one has the delicious resonance of one short story after another. It's available in all the old familiar places. Details  here . WINTER DAYS is ambitious, heartfelt, completely rewarding. You won't regret it, no matter what the temperature. 
 
 May your happiness increase!

 UPSTAIRS WITH DEBORAH AND FRIENDS (DEBORAH KENNEDY, TONY DI GREGORIO, ANDY O'NEILL, September 5, 2019) 
 Posted on  October 2, 2019  |  Leave a comment 
 Deborah Kennedy  is one of the warmest people on the planet, someone I first met in 2005 at The Cajun, playing with Eddy Davis and others (she's also a regular with Woody Allen and other NYC groups) . . . and did I mention that she is a wonderful string bassist who creates lovely melodies, can walk in four, has a beautiful sound and great intonation? And the kindness of her nature comes through her instrument. 
 
 I'd been out of touch with Ms. K for some time although I followed her (at a respectful distance) on Facebook, until she mentioned a little session she'd be having at her uptown apartment. I asked her if I and my camera were welcome, and the answer was an enthusiastic YES. With her were guitarist  Tony DiGregorio  and drummer  Andy O'Neill  , and here are two of the songs they performed that late afternoon. Lovely music, and lovely to reconnect. 
 Sam Rivers' BEATRICE: 
 Antonio Carlos Jobim's WAVE: 
 I hope to make other sessions! And you might want to visit Deborah's Facebook page (noted above) to keep up with her gigging. 
 
 May your happiness increase!

 BRIGHT SHADOWS: SPIKE AND MIKE at SMALLS (April 19, 2012) 
 Posted on  May 1, 2012  |  2 comments 
 "Spike and Mike" isn't a new buddy film, a cable sitcom about two pets on the run, or a box of candy. It's the colloquial title that pianist Spike Wilner and saxophonist Michael Hashim accept as their own . . . also the title of a song Mike wrote to play in duet with Spike. I learned all of this from the front row of Smalls, that congenial jazz club at 183 West Tenth Street, on April 19, 2012. 
 I've heard and admired both players for seven or eight years now: Spike in solo, duo, and with his own PLANET JAZZ; Mike in bands as superficially different as Kevin Dorn's The Big 72 (once known as the Traditional Jazz Collective) and the Microscopic Septet. To my ears, they are splendidly united in their playful idiosyncracies; each is a master of his instrument who closes his eyes and steps off into the unknown, trusting himself and listening to his colleague. And they are friends, which comes through. When I was at Smalls the week before this duet and asked Spike if I could come and record his duets with Mike, his instant response was, "Oh, I love that guy!" And if you watch the videos closely, you'll see Hashim grinning back at Wilner every time the saxophone is out of his mouth. As a duo, they listen intently -- making for the most gratifying play, where Earl Bostic and Nat Cole go off to interstellar space. 
 The program (mostly chosen by Mike) steered away from twice-baked chestnuts, leaning seriously -- and beautifully -- on Billy Strayhorn. You'll hear and see his explanatory introductions, so eloquent as to make my explanations superfluous. But I have to point out that this program began with not one, but two romance-influenced questions. 
 WHAT IS THIS THING CALLED LOVE? 
 DON'T YOU KNOW I CARE (OR DON'T YOU CARE TO KNOW?): 
 SPIKE AND MIKE (an improvisation on the changes of TOPSY): 
 FLAMINGO: 
 Kurt Weill's THIS IS NEW (which I had known only from the Lee Wiley recording on RCA Victor): 
 A Strayhorn duo -- first, the very rare LAMENT FOR AN ORCHID (Absinthe) : 
 and the slightly more familiar JOHNNY COME LATELY: 
 BROTHER, CAN YOU SPARE A DIME? (sadly, almost as relevant in 2012 as 1932): 
 LONG AGO AND FAR AWAY: 
 MOON MIST: 
 THE LATE, LATE SHOW (courtesy of Dakota Staton): 
 Jobim's very soulful DINDI: 
 As Mike says, "It's a waltz. It's our biggest hit!" What else but LOTUS BLOSSOM: 
 Romping on RHYTHM changes: STEEPLECHASE: 
 May your happiness increase.

 "KEEP HOT!" 
 Posted on  December 8, 2009  |  2 comments 
 In THE SPIRIT OF LOUIS, 2009, not long ago, I posted three video performances where the Scandinavian Rhythm Boys were joined by one of the remaining Elders, clarinetist Joe Muranyi. ( https://jazzlives.wordpress.com/2009/11/02/the-spirit-of-louis-2009/ ) 
 If those videos eluded you, or the SRB are new to you, here they are, in Toronto, playing BLUE (and BROKEN-HEARTED). The "Boys" in this incarnation are Hans Jorgen Hansen, bass saxophone and other reeds; Robert Hansson, trumpet; Paul Waters, bass; Michael Bøving, banjo and vocal. And the nicely-done video is by Flemming Thorbye, who has preserved so much fine jazz on YouTube. 
 I find this very affecting. It takes experience to play with such emotion yet to be so restrained. As the late Leroy "Sam" Parkins often said, a group like this is in no hurry; they are taking their time. And they get there! 
 
 A package arrived the other day, STARDUST, a CD with two sessions by the SRB -- one with Joe Muranyi. I had been impressed with the YouTube clips I had seen, but they were nothing compared to the sound of the SRB in the recording studio. For one thing, the studio itself is spacious -- I would guess that the musicians get to see each other and hear other without baffles and headphones. Thus the result is like being very close up to a live performance in a space with ideal acoustics and ambiance. 
 And the SRB plays its collective heart out, without strain. Waters' bass is propulsive without being pushing; his slap-technique is never monotonous or wooden. Hansen has a fine, eloquent facility on all his horns, and he is a masterful ensemble player. Boving is a steady, serene banjoist without the excesses of enthusiasm often connected to that instrument, and he is a compelling singer -- idiosyncratic but with a huge, exuberant voice and attack, a heroic vibrato that made it seem as if every song was his own personal, passionate utterance. And Hansson is simply a magnificent trumpeter -- with a casual daring that honors Louis and Bix, without copying their phrases. His easy mountain-scaling reminded me of Hackett, Cheatham, and Bob Barnard -- and it's supported by a sophisticated harmonic and rhythmic awareness. Muranyi, the guest star, brings his own amused fervor to the proceedings, whether playing or singing his own gleeful I DIG SATCH. And the SRB, with or without Joe, is clearly having fun without being self-consciously silly. They are a wonderfully rewarding band, and this CD is just delightful, with repertoire that goes from Handy to Lyttelton to Jobim and back to Bix-associated tunes without anything sounding forced. (A prize goes to listeners who recognize the Armstrong ending that brilliantly concludes SMILES!) 
 The CD is available through the SRB website ( www.srbjazz.com .) and email inquiries can be sent to  srbjazz@srbjazz.com . 
 And my title? It's how Michael Boving signed his little note along with the CD. The music it contains shows that he and his colleagues are keeping the faith.

 EDDIE HIGGINS (1932-2009) 
 Posted on  September 4, 2009  |  6 comments 
 My good friend Bill Gallagher was lucky enough to know the late pianist Eddie Higgins. With Eddie 's help, Bill became his discographer as well. Here is Bill's beautiful elegy for Eddie: 
 Eddie Higgins: 2/21/1932 – 8/31/2009 
 The world of jazz has lost one of its most talented pianists and I have lost a good friend. Eddie Higgins’ life was brought to an end by complications of lymphatic and lung cancer, an event that seemed to have developed in a matter of a few months. I had seen Eddie perform in Sacramento in late May, had dinner with him, and he showed no evidence or indication of what was to come in a few brief months. 
 Eddie was a generous and talented person in so many ways. He not only played great piano, but he could write well and discuss matters outside of music in ways that were thoughtful and revealing. Although he could be generous with his time, it took a while to crack the veneer of New England reserve that was part of his persona. But the effort and the result was worth it. Underneath was a man who was a gentleman in every sense of the word, a man of taste, a highly developed wit, and one hell of a pianist. 
 His career was established in Chicago during the 50’s, 60’s and 70’s where his longest running gig was a 12 year stint as the resident trio at the London House. Eddie could play just about anything and with anybody, but he mainly stuck to Mainstream. He once described Free Jazz as sounding like “a fire in a pet store.” Over the course of a number of years, he played with Stan Getz, Dizzy Gillespie, Coleman Hawkins, Jack Teagarden, Freddie Hubbard, Lee Morgan, Wayne Shorter, Al Grey and Eddie South. And that’s just the short list. Other well known piano trios that performed at the London House were intimidated by Eddie’s group. Some of the tales that came out of his London House experience were more than entertaining, such as the one involving Buddy Rich. Buddy was drumming like crazy but the customers were leaving because of the volume. The manager asked Eddie to turn down the amplifiers before everyone had left and Eddie did so – but Buddy caught him at it. Accusations were hurled at Eddie, Buddy drummed louder and threatened to get Eddie after the set. Sure enough, he came after Eddie and Eddie hightailed it into the restroom and locked himself in a stall. Buddy found the locked stall and proceeded to do a limbo under the door while Eddie vaulted over the top of the door and out the building. Later, each would avoid bringing up the event when their paths crossed. 
 Also during his Chicago years, Eddie was invited by Art Blakey to join his Jazz Messengers. Eddie refused because he had two young children at the time and it wasn’t a good time to go on the road. He also had an offer to become Carmen McRae’s accompanist but he turned down the opportunity for the same reasons and the job went to Norman Simmons. When further pressed for his reasons for turning down Blakey, he said that he didn’t want to be the odd man in the group. Eddie would have been the only white musician, the only non-user and Blakey had a habit of paying his connections before he paid his musicians. 
 Eddie’s versatility was amazing. During the 70’s he was exposed to some of the early recordings coming out of Brazil and was taken by the new rhythms of the Bossa Nova. Many of his albums include a track or two of a South American composition, but he also produced one of the finest albums of Jobim compositions that exists, “Speaking of Jobim.” If you haven’t heard it, you must. 
 There will be some who read this who will have no idea who Eddie Higgins was or how brilliantly he played. This won’t surprise me because Eddie traveled in certain jazz circuits and was probably better known in Japan and Korea, where his recordings on the Japanese Venus label are among the top jazz sellers. However, Eddie enjoyed deep respect among fellow musicians who admired him as a consummate professional. So, to those who might say, “Eddie, we hardly knew ye,” I understand. But to those who did know him, he was a national treasure and will be missed more than words can express . 
 Bill and Eddie at Sacramento 
 About Eddie: he was one of those rare musicians who can make a melody, apparently unadorned,  sing . Any of his Venus recordings (solo, trio, or quartet) demonstrate that he was someone working beneath the surface of the music, giving himself fully to the song. I also can testify to his gracious nature: having reviewed a Venus CD in  Cadence  (I believe it was his quartet with Scott Hamilton) I got a letter from Eddie, thanking me for what I had written in the most perceptive way. I hope that more people come to his music as the years pass. 
 Jazz photographer John Herr, another Higgins devotee, captured Eddie at the leyboard during the April 2006 Atlanta Jazz Party: 
 Eddie's widow, the singer Meredith D'Ambrosio, sent along this piece on Eddie from the  Chicago Tribune --   http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/chi-obit-ed-higgins-02sep02,0,1489219.story  -- a fitting tribute to a man who brought so much music to that city. We send our condolences to Meredith and to Eddie's family. Thanks to Judith Schlesinger, Bill Gallagher, and John Herr.
