  How To Show A Company Why You Want The Job  
 Robin Schlinger 
 April 11, 2015 
 We need a job to provide ourselves and our family with necessities like food, shelter, and clothing as well as the nonessential pleasures of life, like birthday cake. Our goal is to find a job that achieves all that and, we hope, makes us feel fulfilled as well.  Related:   The Most Important Part Of Your Resume  Companies know that. Their main interest is in the  company’s  goals. What will you contribute to the company’s bottom line and business strategy if you are hired? Your resume should be written in a way that makes it clear why you are applying for a particular position. You have the skills, educational background, and experience the position calls for. You understand the industry or field where you are applying. Most importantly, you have achieved valuable results in previous positions, and you are prepared to produce good work in the future. When a company realizes that your achievements and goals align with the company’s, they are more likely to call you in for an interview.  This post was originally published on an earlier date.
