 Role overview 
 Distributed Systems Dev: Infrastructure & Tools Team 
 The Role 
 The position will let you work in a small team of developers with a focus on building a fund and insurance broker designed for international markets. We currently have two teams: one focused on customer-facing products and one focused on internal tooling and infrastructure. You will join the second team to develop and test services under a data-driven approach to increase the efficiency of our staff as well as our resources. 
 As a professional, you are probably a full-stack developer leaning toward back-end development who enjoys building robust and consistent systems in an entrepreneurial environment with much freedom under responsibility. You are also a person who enjoys learning new technologies and methodologies and is willing to participate in decisions regarding features design & implementation. Most likely, you spend a lot of your free time reading articles and trying out new things. You understand the trade-offs between technical debt, fast development, and consistent and robust code. Ideally, and strive to reduce accidental complexity as much as possible and enjoy removing code as much as adding new one. You consider that effective programming in a team requires being able to communicate with others effectively through your code. 
 You also find testing and documentation to be crucial elements in a good system. We are currently looking to overhaul our testing infrastructure and documentation to be able to scale up our development teams and your input will be crucial to that effort. You are a developer who is very comfortable with building large-scale and fast changing systems with a high number of external integrations.

 Pensionera is a start up working with investment and insurance broking. We are digitizing an otherwise paper-based branch and using technology to help people better invest their pension money. By using a subscription, similarly to services like Netflix and Spotify instead of focusing on kickbacks, we can change how the pension market of today works. We take pride in being completely objective in our advice, with no incentives to recommend certain investments to our customers - we will get the same payment whether you select a governmental index fund, or a high-risk mutual fund.
