 Who are Lloyds Banking Group? 
 Lloyds Banking Group is the UK's leading bank with over 30m customers and its biggest digital bank, with over 13 million active online customers. We've placed an ambitious transformation programme and a multi-channel approach to banking at the heart of our strategy to be the best bank for customers, backed by significant investment in our platforms and people. 
 Why join the Chief Data Office Data Science Team? 
 You'll work on a wide range of interesting projects with no shortage of work! We take ideas from the concept stage and work with our customers to understand how data science and machine learning can be applied. 
 You'll play a pivotal role in realising our digital and data potential and creating the Bank of the Future. 
 You'll help rapidly transform our capabilities and be a key player in our further digitisation using latest emerging technologies and services. 
 What will I do as a Data Science Engineer within the Chief Data Office? 
 You will develop Machine Learning systems in Python alongside our Data Engineers (who build the data pipelines and ensure quality) and in close collaboration with the end users and business SMEs. 
 Our models span the full reach of LBG - from predicting savings balances to identifying which of our customers may fall into financial difficulty and need a helping hand. 
 Your models will have a material impact on the lives of up to 30m+ customers across the whole of the UK - and together we'll make it possible ... 
 Are you who we 're looking for? 
 We're keen to speak to Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers and Software Engineers that have good commercial experience delivering Data Science in Python for large scale industry applications. You will need the industry experience on top of any educational experience. 
 A strong understanding of Python and software engineering is essential including how to write modular Pythonic code, fluency with pandas, Functional Programming, code refactoring, Continuous Delivery, SQL and Docker. 
 Similarly, experience in implementing and supporting Machine Learning systems including the automation of data validation, model training, model validation and model monitoring is also essential. 
 A good theoretical and applied knowledge of Statistical Modelling and/or Machine Learning techniques is beneficial such as: regression, clustering, decision trees and significance testing. 
 The ability to present results in a clear, visual manner to support senior stakeholder decision making is key to the success of our projects.

 You'll get exposure to a host of wider technologies and career moves by broadening your horizons and giving you opportunities to stretch yourself. 
 You'll work with some of the best Data Scientists in the bank as we look to build a thriving data science community, whether through opportunities to share knowledge through self-starting guilds or coach other junior data scientists to support their career development. 
 **What you 'd get in return: ** 
Offering you both funding and profile - we'll provide you with a diverse, energising and informal environment that focuses on equal opportunity and real career progression. 
 We'll take your personal and professional development very seriously and enable you to make a difference to millions throughout your career with us.
