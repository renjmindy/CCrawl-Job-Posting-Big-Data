 A: 
 Kindly fill in your name in the appropriate places. May Allah make matters easy for you, amen.

 Mr xxxxxxxx has brought to our notice that he has requested employment within your company. He is known to be an individual of dedication and honesty. 
 Mr. xxxxxxxxxxxx has also requested that a letter be furnished pertaining to the need of a Muslim male retaining a beard whilst employed by your company. Islamic rules require that under general circumstances Muslim men should maintain a beard as a requirement to male adornment. It is part of the Islamic belief that such a beard should also be maintained with neatness as defined by our religion as well. 
 We hope that your company will allow Mr. xxxxxxxx to be employed whilst maintaining a dress code conduct that he adheres to and views as an integral part of his belief. 
 Should you have any question pertaining to this letter or questions pertaining to religious laws of dress and culture, please do not hesitate to contact me. 
 Yours truly, 
 Muhammed Shoayb

 Q:  You are standing on the top one of two solid metal pillars. They are both exactly one kilometer apart from each other and they both stand one kilometer high. There is absolutely nothing around these pillars but you have one small twig one small rock and an unlimited supply of rope. Using only the materials named how can you get from the top of the pillar that you are on to the top of the other pillar?
