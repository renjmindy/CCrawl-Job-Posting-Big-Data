Whether it's because your job position is hard to explain or it just sounds down right dull, we can help with that. In a new segment for our up coming Careers On Tap series called  Career Hot or Not  , viewers submit their bland job titles, a hobby that they love, and just some brief background on themselves, and our hosts J.T. O'Donnell and Sam Bennett will give you a personal branding makeover - Turning your career 'not' to HOT! If you get any of the reaction below when you talking about "what you do," then you might be the perfect candidate for a Career Hot or Not makeover!
