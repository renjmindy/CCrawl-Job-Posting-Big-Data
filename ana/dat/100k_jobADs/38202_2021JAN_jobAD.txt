 ANNOUNCEMENT 
 Posted on  November 30, 2017  by   sarahgprescott

 11.30.17 
 Dear Readers, 
 The time has come for me to say goodbye to both you and this blog, at least for now. As many of you know this has been a completely volunteer effort with the goal being to encourage librarians from everywhere to travel and work beyond their borders. I spent fourteen years of my life doing just that and it enriched and expanded me both personally and professionally. While I still completely believe in this mission, it is time for me to focus on other goals in my life, although I am not yet clear exactly what will be next… 
 This blog will continue to be hosted and available as searching the archives can be useful when researching potential positions. I will also continue to update my book: How to Become a Traveling Librarian  as well as the  Book Resources  page. 
 I wish everyone, as always, safe travels. 
 Kind regards, Sarah P.

 Staffing Exercise 
 
 
 
 
 N/A 
 United Nations Core Values: Integrity, Professionalism, Respect for Diversity 
 Special Notice 
 This temporary position is available from mid November 2017 for a period of 16 weeks subject to availability of funding. 
 This position is subject to local recruitment pursuant to staff rule 4.4 of the United Nations Staff Rules. All staff in the General Service and related categories shall be recruited in the country or within commuting distance of each office, irrespective of their nationality and of the length of time they may have been in the country. A staff member subject to local recruitment shall not be eligible for the allowances or benefits exclusively applicable to international recruitment. 
 Passing the Global General Service Test (GGST) is a prerequisite for recruitment consideration in the General Services and related categories in the United Nations Secretariat. Applicants who have not passed the GGST at the time of application may be invited for the test after submitting an application. Having passed the Administrative Support Assessment Test in English at the United Nations Headquarters, Economic Commission for Africa, Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, United Nations Office at Geneva, United Nations Office at Vienna, International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda or International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia; or the United Nations Accounting or Statistical Assistant Examination at the United Nations Headquarters may be accepted in lieu of the GGST. 
 Notes: 
 • A current staff member who holds a fixed-term, permanent or continuing appointment may apply for temporary positions no more than one level above his or her current grade. However, a current staff member who holds an appointment at the G-6 or G-7 level may also apply to temporary positions in the Professional category up to and including the P-3 level, subject to meeting all eligibility and other requirements for the position. A staff member holding a temporary appointment shall be regarded as an external candidate when applying for other positions, and may apply for other temporary positions at any level, subject to section 5.7 below and staff rule 4.16 (b) (ii). Therefore, a staff member holding a temporary appointment in the General Service or related categories may only apply to positions within those categories. For full information on eligibility requirements, please refer to section 5 of ST/AI/2010/4Rev.1 on Temporary Appointments. In its resolution 66/234, the General Assembly further “stressed that the Secretary-General should not recur to the practice of temporarily filling posts in the Professional and higher categories with General Service staff members who have not passed the General Service to Professional category examination other than on an exceptional basis, and requests the Secretary-General to ensure that temporary occupation of such posts by the General Service staff shall not exceed a period of one year, effective 1 January 2013…” Consequently, eligible candidates in the General Service or related categories for temporary job openings in the Professional category that have not passed the competitive examination may be selected only on an exceptional basis endorsed by the Office of Human Resources Management where no other suitable candidate could be identified. 
 • Upon separation from service, including, but not limited to, expiration or termination of, or resignation from, a fixed-term, continuing or permanent appointment, a former staff member will be ineligible for re-employment on the basis of a temporary appointment for a period of 31 days following the separation. In the case of separation from service on retirement, a former staff member will be ineligible for re-employment for a period of three months following the separation. This equally applies, mutatis mutandis, with respect to a former or current staff member who has held or holds an appointment in another entity applying the United Nations Staff Regulations and Rules and who applies for a temporary position with the Secretariat. 
 • Retirees above the mandatory age of separation who wish to be considered for the current temporary job opening must indicate the reason for their last separation as "retirement." Such retirees shall not be employed by the Organization, unless (a) the operational requirements of the Organization cannot be met by staff members who are qualified and available to perform the required functions; and (b) the proposed employment would not adversely affect the career development or redeployment opportunities of other staff members and represents both a cost-effective and operationally sound solution to meet the needs of the service. 
 • Subject to the funding source of the position, this temporary job opening may be limited to candidates based at the duty station. 
 • While this temporary assignment may provide the successful applicant with an opportunity to gain new work experience, the selection for this position is for a limited period and has no bearing on the future incumbency of the post. An external candidate selected for this position is bound by the prevailing condition of the staff selection system under ST/AI/2010/3, as amended, and ST/AI/2010/4/Rev.1. A staff member holding a temporary appointment who is recruited in the Professional and above categories on a temporary appointment, and placed on a position authorized for one year or longer may not apply for or be reappointed to his/her current position within six months of the end of his/her current service. This provision does not apply to staff members holding temporary appointments and placed on positions authorized for one year or more in duty stations authorized for peacekeeping operations or special political missions. 
 • The expression “Internal candidates”, shall mean staff members who have been recruited after a competitive examination under staff rule 4.16 or after the advice of a central review body under staff rule 4.15. 
 • Please note that candidates will be required to meet the requirements of Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter as well as the requirements of the position. The United Nations is committed to the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity for all its human resources, including but not limited to respect for international human rights and humanitarian law. Candidates may be subject to screening against these standards, including but not limited to whether they have committed, or are alleged to have committed criminal offences and/or violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law. 
 • For information on special post allowance, please refer to ST/AI/1999/17. For more details on the administration of temporary appointments please refer to ST/AI/2010/4/Rev.1. 
 • The Staff Regulations, Staff Rules and administrative issuances governing staff appointments can be viewed at:  http://www.un.org/hr_handbook/English 
 • Staff members of the United Nations common system organizations who will reach the mandatory age of separation or retirement within the duration of the current temporary need period are not eligible to apply. 
 • Staff members are not eligible to apply for the current temporary job opening if they are unable to serve the specified duration of temporary need before reaching the mandatory age of separation. Submitting an application or selection for the current temporary job opening does not delay or increase the mandatory age of separation.

 10.25.17 -  School Librarian Positions 
TesJobs, UK 
 Sarah P 's comments : Fall is the time to begin to apply for international School Librarian positions. Although TIE ( The International Educator ) is US-based,  TES  is UK-based and free! They do tend to feature schools which offer the  British National Curriculum  and/or the IB ( International Baccalaureate ) however I have known folks to 'cross over' and my recommendation is to try and gain experience in as many systems as possible. By the end of my career, I could list 4 different curriculums and knowing them helped me to become a better librarian and educator (  not  Teacher-Librarian!) For more info about t\his subject, please read  Chapter 3  of my book and/or visit the  Book Resources  page. 
 TES currently has four jobs listed:

 10.21.17 – Now is the time to begin to apply for international school librarian positions. The recruiting season has been moving earlier and earlier each year and, with the first of the international recruiting fairs just around the corner, positions are beginning to be posted. 
 School Librarianship is the area where the most international positions are listed and thus is the easiest way to break into international work. While it is still a good idea to join an agency and be vetted, the majority of schools are now advertising on TIE and accepting direct applications. 
 Currently,  The International Educator  (TIE) currently has 12 positions listed. Many, but not all, require media certification as well as a master’s degree. For more information about this market please join TIE and also review  Chapter 3  of my  book .

 10.16.17 -  Teacher Librarian 
United World College of South East Asia, Singapore 
 SarahP 's comments : A school with a great reputation however reviews warn that you will work very hard at this school. This position is offered through  Teacher Horizons , a free recruiting agency I have written about before:  my blog post . 
 UWC SEA is a unique international school for gifted students of over sixty nationalities. The College is an IB World School and is a member of the Round Square Schools. UWC is an education movement comprised of 12 schools, colleges and national committees worldwide that offer scholarships and bursary schemes as well as accepting fee-paying students. Candidates must be able to engage with the Mission and Vision of the College particularly in terms of Service, Activities and Outdoor Education. Additionally, candidates should be able to adopt a pedagogy which aligns with that of the College - constructive and inquiry-based. 
 Singapore is one of Asia's great cities offering an intriguing blend of Asian and Western cultures. With a wide-range of markets, restaurants, shopping, nightlife areas, outdoor sports facilities and family activities on offer, Singapore has appeal both for singles teachers and families. It is also one of Asia's best travel hubs with Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, India and Sri Lanka all a short and low-cost flight away. 
 To apply: 
If you are interested in this opportunity, please refer to the school's website. Please ensure you select 'Teacherhorizons' on the "Where did you hear about this vacancy?" drop-down menu. 
If you wish, you can also include a link to your Teacherhorizons profile in your application so the school can access your references and documentation.
