 GMR Marketing 
 I spent my time with GMR as a Field Manager for the Jim Beam/Puckers brand. As the field manager I had to set up various promotions and event throughout the Milwaukee and Madison area. Targeting key account on-premise and developing creative ways to promote the different drinks with Puckers. I came up with throwing Pucker specific parties with colorful decor and drinks specials , and also tied to themes or events happening to make the promotions have more visibility.
