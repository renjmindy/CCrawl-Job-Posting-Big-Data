  Got Offered A Job As An IC, What Do I Need to Do?  
 Work It Daily 
 May 01, 2009 
 Dear Experts, I'm about to graduate from college and I've just been offered a job as an Independent Contractor. I understand my employment status as an IC is different than an hourly worker in that I will have to do my own taxes. Do you have any information or resources that will advise me on being an IC?  Our Twitter Advice Project (T.A.P.) is no longer an active campaign. To find an answer to the above question, please use the "Search" box in the right-hand column of this website.
