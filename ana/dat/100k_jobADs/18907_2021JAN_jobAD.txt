Here are the Best Cities to Find a Job in 2018 
 These 25 cities not only have a ton of available jobs, but they’re also filled with some of the most satisfied and happily balanced workers in the United States. 
 Location, Location, Location 
 When it comes to finding a great job – just like finding a great home – it’s all about location, location, location. 
 And these 25 locations are full of incredible opportunities. We used to live in a world where you were more or less stuck with whatever you might see available around you. You’d have to simply hope that your own personal skill sets were in demand with your particular community’s needs. There was a sense of hopelessness and helplessness if what you trained for wasn’t in demand where you lived. But now, thanks to the ever-shrinking world and the deluge of information we have about opportunities available all over the country, you have a better chance of finding rewarding work in places where you can also have an excellent lifestyle. 
 This list is obviously helpful for new graduates who may be in the market for finding fruitful long-term careers. But it’s also really useful for anyone who might feel stuck in an overwhelming situation. If it seems like you can’t find work or that the work you do have doesn’t afford you the lifestyle you want, this information could be life-changing. 
 A recent survey from  Glassdoor.com  studied the 50 most populated city areas in the United States. They analyzed many factors including the number of job openings, the median base salary, and the median home value. Using those numbers, they then used a five-point scale (with 1 indicating the worst city for a job and 5 indicating the best) to determine lifestyle balance and overall job satisfaction. They did so by weighing the cost of living against the average income and available job opportunities. By looking at this bigger picture, they were able to find which cities offered the most opportunity and the most seeming balance between the need to work and the ability to have a life outside of it. They then used those numbers to determine these current 25 top cities to find work and live happily. 
 To help paint a better sense of the overall lifestyle picture, we’ve also added two important numbers. We’ve found the estimated monthly mortgage payments and what percentage they are compared to the median base salary. These mortgage payments are calculated based on the assumption of a 20% down payment on a 20-year mortgage with a 4% interest rate. 
 Additionally, we’ve included the estimated population based on the latest projected government census numbers along with what major industries are traditionally available in the area as provided by  City-Data.com  (unless otherwise noted by available information from a city’s Chamber of Commerce). Of course, these industries are only what the city has been known for in the past. And, as indicated by the listed in demand jobs thanks to Glassdoor.com, often don’t reflect the newest growing industries in a location. 
 Educating yourself can improve your life immensely on so many levels. The information on this list can help you find opportunities for a new life. And it can also help you get a better sense of how your own lifestyle compares to that of other cities across the country.
