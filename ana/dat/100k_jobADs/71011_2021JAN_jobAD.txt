 3D Animator 
 Red Thread Games Apply for this Job 
 Posted 
 November 30, 2020 
 Full Time 
 Anywhere 
 Remote 
 We’re Red Thread Games, the studio behind  Dreamfall Chapters  and  Draugen , and we’re looking for a 3D animator to join us and help build our new game: a narrative-driven, third person action-adventure for PC and consoles. 
 We’re open to remote employees, though we will prioritise applicants who can work onsite in Oslo when the current health crisis has passed. We can provide relocation assistance to international candidates. 
 A background in games is not required, although it helps, and prior experience with Unity is a big plus. But the most important thing is a great showreel. 
 We're deeply committed to inclusiveness and diversity in the game industry, and we strongly encourage women, non-binary people, persons of colour and minorities to apply for positions at Red Thread. 
 ‍ 
 Job Description 
 If hired, you’ll join our studio to work on  Dustborn , a 3D adventure that blends narrative with action in an original and exciting setting in development for PC and consoles. 
 You’ll collaborate with a friendly and inclusive team of fellow artists and designers to animate humanoid characters, robots, monsters, environments and effects. Your work will span all game systems and features, including combat, world interaction systems, dialogue sequences and cut-scenes. 
 This is a full-time position, starting early 2021. Given the current global health crisis, the development team is working remotely. Candidates for this position must be prepared to work from home for a period, and until further notice, before potential relocation is possible and advisable. 
 ‍ 
 Responsibilities 
 
 Under direction from the animation director, you’ll work on a wide range of animations for both human and non-human characters, including loops, combat animations, cinematic animations, and facial expressions 
 Ideally, you’ll also help with the rigging/skinning of characters 
 Collaborate with animators, artists and designers to convey character personalities and game mechanics 
 Work independently to ensure your tasks are delivered on time and to a high quality 
 
 ‍ 
 Qualifications 
 
 You’re a proficient and skilled 3D animator with prior experience in character animation, either from games or other media: it doesn’t have to be professional work, but you need a great showreel 
 The job requires working in 3ds Max, but experience from Maya or Blender is sufficient (just be prepared to learn Max!) 
 Rigging/skinning skills = a big bonus 
 Solid grasp of the English language — written and spoken. (Norwegian language skills are  not  required for this position) ** 
** 
 
 ‍ 
 What we 're looking for. 
 We’re looking for curious, creative and friendly folks who share our love for storytelling, role-playing and adventure games. 
 Professional experience helps a lot (and is required for some positions) but we’re willing to take a chance on you if you have an exceptional portfolio, a willingness to learn, and we believe you’ll function well on the team. 
 (Also, if you’ve played and enjoyed our previous games, you should definitely let us know.) 
 We're deeply committed to inclusiveness and diversity in the game industry, and we strongly encourage women, non-binary people, persons of colour and minorities to apply for positions at Red Thread. 
 ‍ 
 **  The Coronavirus ** 
 The virus affects us all, and even though Norway has weathered the crisis well, and Red Thread Games has continued operating through the pandemic (with most of our crew working remotely), it does mean that international recruitment is challenging. We’re therefore open to adding remote employees to our team, who can hopefully transition to on-site employees when the borders open up again.

 About Dustborn 
 Lead a band of misfits and outcasts on a thrilling road-trip across a Divided States of America. A story-driven action-adventure about hope, love, friendship, robots…and the power of words. 
 ‍ 
 ‍ 
 About our studio. 
 Our team has development experience from games like The Longest Journey, Dreamfall, Anarchy Online, Age of Conan, The Secret World, Dreamfall Chapters, Draugen — and many others. We’re passionate about our work: we love games, we love telling stories, and we love working together in a collaborative and creative environment where everyone gets to contribute and learn from each other. 
 Red Thread makes story-driven games for PC and consoles, and we’re currently working on several exciting titles, including  Dustborn  and Svalbard.  ‍ 
 ‍ 
 ‍ 
 Common to all positions. 
 We’re looking for candidates who are curious, motivated, self-driven and who can demonstrate initiative and a positive attitude — preferably with prior game development experience — along with a relevant university/college degree, an exceptional portfolio, and professional references. 
 You’ll be joining a small indie studio working out of a cosy office in downtown  Oslo, Norway . We occupy the third floor of a  beautiful and historic 146 year old building , with  two   restaurants  and a  café/bar  on the first floor, a pizzeria/bar and an  amazing coffee-and-sandwich place  across the street, a  Japanese Izakaya  around the corner, and multiple grocery stores, lunch bars and cafés just minutes away. 
 We’re a ten-minute walk from much of what  central Oslo  has to offer, including all public transportation, malls, museums, parks, restaurants and nightlife — and the forest and fjord are only 15 minutes away by metro or bus. Oslo has been ranked #7 on the  list of the world’s happiest cities , and  Norway ranks fifth on the list of happiest countries . What we’re saying is: this is a  happy  place! 
 We don’t believe in crunch time at Red Thread. We believe that family, friends, and a thriving personal life are more important than work, and that people are more creative and productive when they’re also happy and healthy. We work five days a week, seven-and-a-half hours a day. We have five weeks of annual holiday, along with flexible work hours. And don’t let anyone tell you there’s no such thing as a free lunch: we serve one every day! 
 We’re looking for people of all colours, genders, ethnic backgrounds, religious beliefs and sexual orientations who fit in with our passionate, experienced and inclusive team of artists, designers and developers. We expect everyone to contribute, and in return you get to shape our games, worlds and stories for years to come!
