 Ombudsman and Hospice Worker 
 I have been an Ombudsman in San Mateo County now for 4 years. It has been interesting and a good chance to learn what assisted living is like and what happens in a memory care home. I have met some wonderful people and have experienced the good and bad of these expensive alternatives. Buyer beware! 
 In California Ombudsmen have a formal licensed role: 
 My newest role is as a hospice volunteer at Mission Hospice San Mateo County. I finished the training period and have only just started at the Hospice House in Redwood City, CA. I am sure I will have lots to report in the future.

 hospice ombudsman Volunteer 
 Published by Richard Schwachter 
 I am a senior with five grandchildren (and formerly caregiver to my father who had Alzheimer's disease). I have a profound interest in the problems associated with aging seniors and elder care law. I am presently a field ombudsman in San Mateo County California, a hospice volunteer, a licensed Certified Civil Circuit Mediator in Florida and a listed ADR provider in the Santa Clara Superior Court California. I am a graduate of Case Western Reserve Law School, the University of Wisconsin and a member of the Ohio Bar. I am a world traveler with my wife Barbara.   View all posts by Richard Schwachter
