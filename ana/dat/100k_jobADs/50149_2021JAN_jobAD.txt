  Promotion Killers: Chronic Job Poster  
 Bud Bilanich 
 January 18, 2013 
 Some people think that posting for every job that comes along brands them as someone who is  career oriented  and committed to their company. Not true. When you post for every job that comes open, you come across as desperate for a  promotion . You don’t want to get the” desperate” label attached to you. Decision makers see chronic job posters as unfocused and unclear about their life and career goals. They assume you're more interested in the title and money that comes with a promotion than making a positive impact in the job you’ve posted. Don’t be a chronic job poster. Be selective. Get focused. Post for those jobs in which you have a legitimate interest and, more important, the skills to perform in the job. Being selective will increase your chances of getting that elusive promotion. You’ll brand yourself as a real pro in your field.
