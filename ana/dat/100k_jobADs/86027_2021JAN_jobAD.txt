 Okay 
 Look At This! it's a Freelance job 
 Butter Studio is looking for a Freelance Freelance Designer in Remote. Not an ordinary Freelance Freelance Designer but the kind of Freelance Freelance Designer that makes other Freelance Freelance Designers question their Freelance Freelance Designer-ness. 
 About 
 Butter is seeking highly motivated and talented designers to collaborate with the studio on an as-needed basis. Weâ€™re looking for designers who have excellent brand, web, motion graphics, typography, graphic design, and illustration skills. 
 We're not concerned with level of experience, it's all about the work, intention, and attitude. 
 Upcoming projects include web, app, UX, art direction for photography, motion graphics, and brand design. Designers must have a strong mix of brand, ux/ui, and motion skills to be considered. 
 Please apply to hello@butterstudio.co with your portfolio, quick note of why you're a good fit, rate and current availability and projected availability over the next 4-6 months. 
 We are looking to meet folks to partner with immediately and in future. 
 We're a queer and female led studio creating values-driven work with brands we admire.
