 Wheaton American Job Center Moving to New Location 
 The long-awaited move for our Wheaton American Job Center (AJC) is less than a month away! For years, the AJC has been located at Westfield South Office Building in Wheaton at 11002 Veirs Mill Road. The new location at 11510 Georgia Ave, just one mile away, is easier to find with more street visibility and short walking distance from the Wheaton Metro Station (.04 of a mile). There’s plenty of free on-site parking as well.

 The AJC will be located on the 1st and 3rd floors of the new building, unlike the current four-floor setup at Westfield South, allowing for more efficient customer flow. In addition to the much-improved layout and larger space, there will be updated restrooms and elevators, a brand new reception area, new furniture, computer lab, training and huddle rooms–all custom-built with job seekers in mind. The ADA entrance will be at the ground level in the rear of the building under the parking pavilion, providing cover during the weather. 
 Young Adult Opportunity Program Relocation 
 The WSM Young Adult Opportunity Program (YAOP), currently located in downtown Silver Spring, will also make the move to the new Wheaton AJC later this year. Youth will have a designated entrance and space where they can spend time with our staff and among their peers. They’ll also have access to the rest of our AJC resources. 
 What Happens Next? 
 The Westfield South location will close to the public on October 24th and Wheaton AJC services will be suspended until October 31st when the new Georgia Ave location re-opens to the public. The new location will adhere to the same schedule and hours. An invitational ribbon-cutting ceremony will be held on Wednesday, October 30th.
