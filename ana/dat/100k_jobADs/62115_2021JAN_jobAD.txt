 Veteran Services 
 SC Works representatives are available in the SC Works Center throughout the week to help veterans transition into the workforce. 
 Local Veteran Outreach Specialists and Disabled Veteran Outreach Specialists (DVOP) are trained to provide intensive, priority employment services to all veterans, including group and individual career coaching, job referrals, resume preparation help, career fairs and job search workshops, job training programs, and referrals to training services.

 Veterans Receive Priority of Service 
 As a "Thank you!" for your service, Veterans and eligible spouses receive priority of service when entering the SC Works Centers. 
 Our SC Works Centers give priority of service to veterans and eligible spouses. This service policy aligns with The Jobs for Veterans Act and ensures that those who have served our country move to the front of the line for employment and training services. 
 Who qualifies as a Veteran? 
 A veteran is defined as "a person who served in the active military, naval, or air service, and who was discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable." 
 Active service includes full-time duty in the National Guard or Reserve component, other than full-time duty for training purposes. Spouses may be covered under this policy as well if they meet one of several criteria. 
 Veterans and their spouses must meet program eligibility requirements. For more information, contact or visit your local SC Works Center.
