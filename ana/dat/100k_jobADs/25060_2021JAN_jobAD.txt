 **On the Job Injury Attorney - NY ** 
 A work accident can spell disaster, especially when it results in a severe injury that leaves you out of work. A loss of income and increasing medical bills may cause significant financial setbacks that are difficult to overcome. Thankfully, each state has workers' compensation laws on the books to protect employees in the event of a work-related injury or illness. Not all workers are eligible for this coverage, but most are. And even in the event that you are not eligible for workers’ compensation benefits, you may be able to take advantage of other legal options at this time. An experienced New York on the job injury attorney from  Polsky, Shouldice & Rosen, P.C.  can help to clarify which legal options are relevant to your unique situation. 
 Employer 's Responsibilities 
 Companies are often required to carry specialized insurance coverage that triggers when an employee is hurt or falls ill as a direct result of their job. Some examples of this include: 
 
 Injuries that result from a fall 
 An illness that develops due to poor environmental conditions 
 Repetitive motion injuries resulting from common work tasks 
 Psychological damages caused by workplace violence 
 
 Depending on the type of company you work for, there are a set of safety rules imposed by OSHA that dictate what practices are in place to keep employees safe from harm. If any of these standards gets ignored or broken, the employer may have to file a claim with their insurance company. Regardless, you should be entitled to workers’ compensation benefits no matter whose fault the accident in question was. A NY on the job injury attorney can explain if any exceptions apply in your situation, but usually workers’ compensation benefits are available after an accident regardless of fault. 
 Employee 's Responsibilities 
 While employers need to adhere to a set of safety standards, so, too, must their workers. Getting hurt as the result of ignoring safety protocols may not affect your ability to receive workers' compensation benefits under certain limited circumstances. Things like medical treatment and income may not be paid out by the insurance company if you directly caused your accident. For example, if you were injured due to a fall off a roof while working construction but you were visibly drunk at the time, your legal options may be more limited than they would otherwise be. 
 Workers ' Compensation Benefits 
 If your injury qualifies for workers' compensation insurance coverage, you may get medical care for your injuries. The insurance company may pay for some or all of your treatment and any ongoing care or rehabilitation medical professionals deem appropriate for your injury. The insurance company may also pay for some or all of your lost wages if you cannot go to work while recovering. In extreme cases, you may not be able to return to your prior position due to physical limitations. These instances may necessitate retraining and alternate vocation options for you to continue working at all. A NY on the job injury attorney can speak with you about all of the details regarding how compensation may be paid out in regards to your unique situation. 
 If you suffer an injury at work, you may want to consult with a  NY on the job injury attorney  for help in navigating the workers’ compensation claims process. Sometimes legal action is required to get benefits from the insurance company. In these instances, an attorney can provide the best chance for you to obtain what you deserve under the laws where you live.
