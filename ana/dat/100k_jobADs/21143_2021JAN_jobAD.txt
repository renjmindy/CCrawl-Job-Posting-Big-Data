 The medical field is one of the most sought after career paths in the world. If you think about the job most associated with helping other people, a physician will likely be the first thing that comes to mind. Becoming a doctor is one of the noblest things a person can do with their lives. 
 It is also one of the better-paying jobs you can do regardless of where in the world you happen to live. While it is true that some lineman whose name you don’t know, on a losing NFL team, with a mediocre career likely makes more than the average doctor, that player’s career will be short and brutish. And at the end of it, he will need to spend what money he has saved on seeing a good doctor. 
 Not only is being a doctor a noble job and one of the highest paying jobs, it is also one of the most respected jobs. There is much esteem associated with saving lives. That said, there are many people who would love to contribute to that cause, but who have an aversion to close contact with, well, people. The good news is that there are many ways to contribute to the healing arts without becoming a doctor. Here are 5. 
 1. Pharmacist 
 You probably felt like a pharmacist the first time you used one of those online  pill identifier  tools to help a loved one figure out what those pills were. You know, the ones in the bottle with the worn out label. It is the feeling you get when you help someone sort out a medical issue without the 12 years of school. 
 That feeling might lead you to pursue formal  pharmacy career training . The average annual salary for a pharmacist is over $112,000.  Click Here to Read Article …

 Ben Franklin once  wrote  in his annual Poor Richard’s Almanack that “the same man cannot be both friend and flatterer.” Oftentimes we’re so focused on not hurting our friends’ feelings that we flatter them instead of giving them the cold hard truth. 
 And why wouldn’t you give them the cold hard truth? Because you know that they will most likely hold some sort of a grudge against you after the fact. 
 To anyone who’s ever given their best friend a hard dose of truth: much respect. But for the rest of us who find it hard to give constructive criticism, we’re paralyzed when it comes time to talk.

 If you are one of the many people who feel their career is in a rut and that it might be time for a promotion or raise, then it is time for you to become the “Go to Guy”. But why would you want to do that? 
 
 The Go to Guy is the person that your boss and colleagues know they can turn to whenever they need advice -- or just need to get something accomplished. 
 The Go to Guy is indispensable (therefore, powerful) in the greater scheme of office politics. 
 The Go to Guy can leverage his superior’s opinions towards projects, inter-departmental promotions, and raises. 
 
 The best part is with good, old-fashioned hard work and initiative you can be the Go to Guy.  You can make the leverage work for you.  Here are the top three ways to  shine above the rest . 
 1. Volunteer for Everything 
 There are several ways that volunteering can help elevate you above the rest. Volunteers are already in short supply. Many avoid volunteering because it means doing more work for no pay. This is why every organization needs solid and dependable volunteers for many tasks.  Whatever you do, do not get caught up in that frame of thought.  The benefits of volunteering come back to you in spades. It may not be the same as a paycheck, but in the end volunteering will pay greater…and in dividends. 
 The first way to volunteer is the simplest -- and always seen. Whenever there is an opportunity to take on more work, take it on and do an awesome job. Go "above and beyond" in your volunteer efforts. Your boss will take notice of this and place additional confidence in you. He will see your commitment and zeal in the volunteer efforts and transfer that image to his ideas of your normal work. The bonus here is that any positive feelings and thoughts he has at this point are multiplied due to the fact that you are generously volunteering your time to help the company. While this does mean more work for you, the sacrifice will definitely give boost your career and overall inter-office image.

 Think about a major  goal  you have. 
 It may be a monetary goal like achieving a six-figure income at the end of the next five years. 
 It may be to reach international trading status or become an industry expert. 
 Whatever it is, hold it in your mind, think about it and put all of your  focus  into it. 
 Can you truly see yourself in that position, whatever it may be? If you can’t, you need to analyze why that is. 
 Believe me when I say this: Anything is  possible  in business. When you hold that as a strong belief, then you’ll always have a base point to fall back to. You can always reassure yourself that you are heading in the right direction and that what you want is possible.  Click Here to Read Article …

 If you are like most students, you probably have to earn at least some money to keep up with living expenses. 
 You may even need to earn wages to offset some of the costs of your tuition and other educational expenses. 
 This means getting, at the very least, a  part-time job . 
 Some students are able to balance work and school with no issues. 
 However, these students often do not have challenging class schedules, nor do they have particularly challenging jobs. 
 If you are in rigorous classes, if you work many hours per week, or if you have a job that is mentally or physically taxing, balancing work and studying becomes a big task to overcome. Don't be discouraged. Many people have made it through  college  while also working.  Click Here to Read Article …
