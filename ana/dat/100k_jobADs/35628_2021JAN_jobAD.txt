 Job Market Stakeholders: The People You Will Be Dealing With

 Working With Recruiters » 
 
 When applying for a position, it is important to keep in mind who the stakeholders are. 
 
 Each stakeholder plays a specific role in the hiring process and has different criteria by which to evaluate you. 
 
 Make sure you know who you are interacting with and the role the person plays. Adapt your approach, message or questions accordingly. For instance, when talking to someone in HR,  don’t ask technical questions  about the position. Instead, ask about employment benefits or company-wide policies. When talking to a future co-worker, try to relate to him or her. When talking to your future boss, demonstrate that you are someone reliable who will be a real asset to the team. Tailoring your message will allow you to make a better impression while at the same time gaining more insights into the organization.
