 Sir/ Madam 
 I am a graduating nursing student this coming March 2013. Also, I do have a plan to get care giving training certificate after taking my exam. Most of the agencies are looking for female care givers. I just want to ask if there are times that you had care giving job orders for males. Please inform me if you will have in the future? Do your agency have like email job updates? How can subscribe to it ever you have? 
I hope to hear from you soon! 
 Warm regards.
