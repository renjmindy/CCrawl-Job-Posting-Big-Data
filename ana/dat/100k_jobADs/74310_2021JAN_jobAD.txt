 Generalist Programmer 
 Ant Workshop Apply for this Job 
 Posted 
 December 2, 2020 
 Full Time 
 United Kingdom 
 Remote 
 ~£30,000pa 
 We’re looking for a  Generalist Programmer . We want someone who knows their way around Unity (but that doesn't have to be professional experience - our code team is very supportive and we can help you get up to speed). You'll mostly be working on an original IP, across a wide range of features. 
 We expect to pay the successful hire around  £30,000pa,  depending on experience. 
 ‍ 
 ‍  Requirements 
 We’re looking for someone who: 
 
 Has a good working knowledge of Unity and C# 
 Is self motivated and able to organise their own time. 
 Loves working on a wide range of programming tasks, and a variety of projects. 
 Can communicate well in English, both written and verbally. 
 Works well in a small cross-discipline team with art, design, production, and QA. 
 Will identify development risks, shout about them, and help create plans to avoid or mitigate them. 
 Is keen to work across multiple platforms including PS5, Xbox Series, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, mobile, and whatever else looks cool  (If you have experience of working with Unity on these already then that’s awesome, but if not I’m sure you’ll pick up the quirks quickly enough) 
 
 ‍ 
 ‍  What we offer  ‍ 
 As a small indie company we can’t offer a load of flashy benefits, but we are  extremely flexible with work hours  to fit around your needs, such as for childcare provision and other home life stuff  (need compressed hours? Not a problem),  and have an above-average  35 days of holiday .  ‍ 
 Working from home  is basically a necessity these days isn't it? But we were doing it before  [waves arms]  all of this! The team is based in Scotland however and it might make things like social events easier if you're eventually able to be somewhere close by. For boring reasons you will need to be UK based, at the very least. 
 Ant Workshop & our regular freelancer pool is roughly 1/3rd non-male. This is a friendly, collaborative company. We'll value you and your work as a key part of our small team, and you’ll have the opportunity for a lot of creative input. We will be transparent with you about what the company's doing and why. 
 How to apply  ‍ 
 Please send a c.v, cover letter, and any relevant cool portfolio stuff you want to show us to  jobs@ant-workshop.com   (if you have any questions, use that email address as well.)  ‍ 
 Depending on the volume of applications, we may not be able to respond to all applicants.

 About Us 
 Hello! We’re a small Edinburgh-based company that works on a mix of our own IP and helping other indies bring their cool games to console. We work with a diverse pool of freelancers, and we're looking to expand the team working in-house. In the last year alone we've worked on over 10 SKUs including  John Wick Hex  ,  Yes Your Grace  , and  Lair of the Clockwork God  , as well as creating updates for  Dead End Job  and laying the groundwork for our next IPs. 
 And that was all in 2020, which let's face it was not a great year generally. We're going to have an even more exciting 2021, with some great client projects signed, a new game launch, and next generation consoles!

 About Dead End Job 
 Dead End Job merges the frantic, addictive, highly replayable gameplay of a procedurally generated twin-stick shooter with the iconic look of a 90s cartoon. 
 You take on the role of Hector Plasm, a worker at Ghoul-B-Gone – the #1 experts in paranormal pest control. Blast ghosts and then suck them up using your trusty vacuum pack, as every ghost you catch, citizen rescued, and job completed is added to the client’s bill. 
 Literally haunted by your former partner-cum-mentor who didn’t come back from a job one night, they’re training you up to save their soul before they're forced to spend eternity as a spook (voted “Least Preferred Fate” in Ghost Hunter Monthly).
