 About KMLabs 
 Kapteyn-Murnane Laboratories LLC (KMLabs) was established in 1994 by Henry Kapteyn and Margaret Murnane to provide the first commercial laser capable of generating 10 fs (10-14 sec) pulses of light— the basic design developed then remains the foundation of our Griffin product lines—still state-of-the-art performance two decades later. KMLabs has expanded steadily to become one of the most capable ultrafast laser companies on the planet. In 2002, KMLabs commercialized the first ultrafast ti:sapphire laser-amplifier systems employing cryogenic cooling—a technology again driven by the needs of research for high-power ultrafast lasers to generate coherent x-rays. This technology is now represented in our Dragon and Wyvern product lines. In 2009, KMLabs began supplying the systems and apparatus required for coherent up conversion of laser pulses to very short wavelengths using the high harmonic up conversion process. This has evolved into the XUUS product, which in essence realizes a 50-year goal in laser technology of making a practical, tabletop-scale x-ray laser. This development comes as the increasing demands of nanoelectronics and nanotechnology demand new tools for investigati...on, inspection, and metrology. KMlabs now has the widest range of ultrafast lasers in the industry. KMLabs has made the majority of the very high-power >10W average power ultrafast lasers used in leading edge research labs today, and has a robust program of SBIR/STTR-funded research to develop new generations of ultrashort-pulse laser technology. A major thrust in recent years is to take ultrafast laser technology out of the lab and into the field for uses such as precision micromachining and materials characterization. KMLabs now is moving from research into industrial applications, bringing with it an unmatched depth of experience in the many subtleties of ultrafast laser technology that can make the different between success and mediocrity in outcome.

Qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, creed, religion, color, national or ethnic origin, citizenship, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, genetic information, veteran status, age or disability status.
