 The M&M Report: "Steve Jobs" 
 
 On this episode of The M&M Report, Devin Mitchell and I discuss the notorious box-office bomb  Steve Jobs  , a big-budget prestige drama from a major studio that's  performing almost exactly the same  as the 2013 indie drama  Jobs  (starring Ashton Freaking Kutcher). 
 Peruse the  M&M Report  category page for previous episodes of the podcast. Thanks for listening!

 "Steve Jobs": Shiny Exterior, Some Bugs 
 
 Steve Jobs was innovative, creative, driven, dogged and inestimably intelligent. But was he an interesting person? 
 Judging by  Steve Jobs  , a feature film meticulously scripted by Aaron Sorkin and studiously crafted by Danny Boyle, the answer is…maybe not? Kind of? It's hard to tell what the filmmakers think, let alone what you're supposed to after spending two hours with him. As enlivened with dazzling intensity by Michael Fassbender, the Jobs of this film vociferously berates his coworkers, belittles his female colleague and confidant Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) and rejects all notions of responsible parenting. Yet by the end, he is redeemed, or at least validated. 
 The movie doesn't provide insight into how he gets there, nor does it transcend the limitations of its genre. The first two acts set up a fascinating story of a man overcoming professional setbacks without even the barest hint of interpersonal skills, but the third act doesn't nail the dismount. What's left is a cheap and lazily rendered stab at sentimentality that's supposed to make you feel bad for a guy who spent the previous two-thirds of the movie alienating everyone around him - and you. Instead, you just feel bad for the people who will accept this cop-out as honest.
