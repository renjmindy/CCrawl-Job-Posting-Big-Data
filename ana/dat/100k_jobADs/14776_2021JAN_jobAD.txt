 About ArchForm 
 About the role 
 Skills:  JavaScript, Node.js, React, Amazon Web Services (AWS) 
 ArchForm (YC W18) is a Series A stage startup that is replacing orthodontic braces with a new kind of 3D printed device and CAD software. 
 We are looking for someone to help with the development of the Archform web dashboard, which is built with React and AWS. Dentists use Archform to turn imported 3D scan data into patient treatment plans. You will work with our Lead Developers to improve Archform's UI and cloud capabilities. This is a unique opportunity to participate in the development of a new kind of 3D CAD tool being built on open-source technologies, in the context of a company pushing the boundaries of what is possible with 3D Printing and distributed manufacturing. 
 In this position, you will be involved in all aspects of the development of the Archform web dashboard, with a particular focus on: 
 
 Improving the existing UI styling/layout and simplifying user workflows 
 Extending the current AWS integration and improving patient management 
 E-commerce, 3D viewing, and other future web products 
 
 It would be great if you had some of the following skills. However, we also believe that if you are a motivated learner you will be able to pick up most of what you need to know on the job: 
 
 Amazon AWS (DynamoDB, Cognito, Lambda) 
 React 
 
 Archform's web dashboard is a core component of the go-to-market strategy of Archform the company, and the developer who fills this position will play a central role in the company as we grow.
