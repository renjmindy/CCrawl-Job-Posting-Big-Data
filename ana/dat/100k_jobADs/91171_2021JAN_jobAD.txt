 Jeremiah 9:23-24 
 "Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the Lord."

 Nance Biswas: Leaning on Jesus 
 Hi! Welcome to my small space online! I am Nance, the writer of this blog. It is my desire that the God of the Bible will use my writing to influence readers and visitors of this blog to know Him better as I testify of His work in my personal life. All I desire is to bring glory to His name. I am persuaded that I can't do it without leaning on Jesus, my Lord and my Savior. Enjoy your stay!
