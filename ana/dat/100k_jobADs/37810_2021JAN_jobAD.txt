 Salary vs. Experience: How to Weigh Benefits in Choosing a Job 
 Oriel Partners 
 Having a variety of job offers is a rare opportunity, especially in the present-day world, where the unemployment rate is high. In this case, congratulations if you are among the lucky people to land into multiple job opportunities. These numerous job offers come with a stressful side, where you have to choose which job to take and which one to let go. 
 The two most common variables used for job comparisons are salary and experience. Most candidates are often excited about having several job offers. As a result, they end up making rushed decisions— some of which they regret later in life. This article seeks to shed some light on how you can start weighing benefits in choosing a job that’s right for you. 
 Old Age Question: Salary or Experience 
 The question of what to choose between salary and work experience has been a topic of controversy for years. Take an example of two candidates who are faced with this daunting experience of  having to choose between salary and experience . They each make independent choices according to what seems fit for them. One candidate chooses to go for experience and endures the hassle of low pay but manages to build a long-life career. Years later, this candidate lands into their dream job, which is a fulfilling achievement. On the other hand, the other candidate goes for  high paying online jobs . Through the high pay, they forgo a fulfilling career. He argues that demanding life situations like having bills to foot triggered their decision to settle for the high paying job offer. 
 Another important argument is that, in the early years of your career,  experience comes first . After school, you are likely to land into several internship positions, which come with different pays. Confusion and stress arise when one job opportunity comes with low pay and an excellent environment to nurture your skills and experience. At the same time, the other job offers lucrative pay without a good environment to grow your skills. It is advisable to go for the one with a good environment to nurture your skills. Later in your career, your experience and expertise play a significant role in determining your pay. 
 Making a sound decision at the early stages of your career goes a long way toward achieving or forfeiting your career goals and dreams. Therefore, it is vital to do extensive soul searching and consultations from friends and colleagues before making such a critical decision. 
 How To Identify the Kind of Job Offer To Accept? 
 Landing into a promising job offer begins by standing out as a candidate. Interviews often have tens or hundreds of interviewees all with the right qualifications; you therefore, have to look for ways to stand out among the rest. In addition to having a well-crafted Curriculum vitae, there are other ways on  how to stand out as a candidate . 
 Being a proactive job applicant and standing out among the other candidates, you now have several job offers at hand. It is now the time to start choosing a job that's right for you. Below are a few tips on how to know which job to get. 
 Have Complete Details About Each Offer 
 There is more in a job offer than the salary vs. experience comparison variables. Before getting down to compare both offers, you should ask for all the details of each. For example, you can ask for the job benefits or work compensation that come along with the offers. Inquiries give you a comprehensive understanding of what you are getting yourself into before making a decision. 
 Make a Comparison 
 Having gathered everything there is for each job offer, it is now time to make a comparison. It is advisable to make a side-by-side comparison through the old school way of writing on a notebook or through an excel sheet. Compare each item for both offers, for example, salary on say job offer A and B, hours of work, organisation’s reputation, and growth opportunities, among other factors. You may also consider creating a score sheet for the offers. The score sheet allows you to know what you are trading off by choosing one offer over another. 
 Listen To Your Conscience 
 Despite having a winning job offer from the comparison part, you should think of any red flags you encountered during the interview. Most candidates often overlook this tip, but it is of equal importance. For example, did the interview start and end at the scheduled time? How comfortable were you before the interviewing panel? Were the interviewers friendly? Such factors help you to establish whether the workplace is toxic or not. Do not push aside these critical factors for the sake of a lucrative pay or promising expected work experience. 
 Politely Turn Down the Losing Job Offer 
 Congrats on making up your mind on which job offer to take, whether in terms of salary or experience. Gracefully turn down the losing job offer and remember to thank the employer for allowing you to work for them—you never know when you will be on the job search again in the future. 
 Conclusion 
 In Conclusion, salary and experience are equally important for a candidate. It is, therefore, upon you to make a decision based on what seems fit for you. However, you should note that some little sacrifices during the early days of your career may earn you some lifetime benefits—all the best as you implement the above tips on how to choose a job in making a sound career choice.
