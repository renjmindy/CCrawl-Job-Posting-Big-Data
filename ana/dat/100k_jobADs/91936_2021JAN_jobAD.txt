 Steve Jobs finally walks into the sunset after changing the world. A school district uses sheep as lawnmowers. And a fun day at U.S. Open qualifying 
 Posted on  August 25, 2011  |  1 Comment 
 Usually, when a CEO leaves a company, the tributes to him or her are overblown. 
No one person is that much bigger than the product or business, 99 times out of 100. Most anyone else below the big chief can do that job. 
And yet, with the news that Steve Jobs is stepping down, it definitely seems like the hype is about accurate. 
This guy changed the world. His brilliant innovations with Apple are too numerous to be named here; there's probably no area of technology that Jobs and Apple haven't had a hand in. (if you're reading this on an iPhone, I rest my case). 
Jobs has been sick for a while, so Wednesday's news isn't a huge surprise, I guess. 
But it still feels like the end of an era. What a remarkable career he's had; people forget that he was thought to be all washed up when he left Apple. Check out  this interview from 1994 , and see how prescient this man was. 
 
 **You think your school district has funding problems? Please. You haven't seen the trouble facing Carlisle, Pa. How desperate are these folks? They're not using lawnmowers anymore to cut the grass at two local schools. T hey're using  _ sheep. 
_That's right, sheep. Seven of 'em, on loan from the principal of the middle school. (Why does the principal own seven sheep? I'm guessing that's a whole 'nother story). 
Embarrassing that a school district would have to do this. But hey, also educational for the kids? Who needs a field trip to the animal farm when you've got Dolly and Co. right outside the classroom window? 
 
**How often in life do you get to stand five feet away from professional athletes, as they play some of the biggest matches of their career? 
Not often. Which is why I did something I've always wanted to do this week: Go to the qualifying tournament at the U.S. Open. 
For those not familiar with the "qualies" it works like this: If you're a pro tennis player ranked in the top 100 or so, you automatically get into the U.S. Open. If you're not, you have to play your way in through what's called a qualifying tournament. For several days you try to beat other men and women desperate to make it into the main draw. 
Every year before the Open they open the National Tennis Center in Queens, N.Y. and let fans watch the qualies for free. I went this year and it was fantastic. You can literally get five feet from these men and women while they're playing; you can't do that with any other sport. 
Sure, there were no huge famous names like Roger Federer or Serena Williams playing, but these were true pros fighting their guts out, and in many cases the money they were trying to win would determine whether they could keep playing as a pro next year. 
It was great fun. And yeah, there may be some more U.S. Open posts from me next week; I'm going at least twice, and hoping for more.  In the immortal words of Bart Scott , I can't wait.

 Can camels instead of school buses be far behind?

   Wide World of Stuff 
 
 It’s finally Inauguration Day, and the reign of terror and lies has finally ended. A parrot sings Led Zeppelin and it’s fabulous. And a 74-year-old Texas man wanted to play catch with someone, and something magical happened. 
 The NFL championship games are set: It’s Rodgers vs. Brady, and Bills vs. Chiefs. It’s Inauguration week, so I’m thinking of Maya Angelou. And the new Pixar movie “Soul” is very very good. 
 Good News Friday: A father sees his formerly-ill son play pro soccer, fulfilling a dream. A college basketball player hits a game-winning shot, three years after a leukemia diagnosis. And a groom gives his teacher bride an awesome surprise at the altar 
 The man who got drunk and woke up as Celine Dion (seriously). A periodic reminder of how amazing LeBron is, after this incredible 60-foot pass. And Ken Jennings with a lovely tribute to Alex Trebek. 
 Some thoughts on the riot at the U.S. Capitol: Trump must be impeached, and his “brand” may be permanently damaged. A club-level soccer team in England scores a big upset, then belts out an Adele love song. And in the NFL playoffs, the Bills win a thriller, the Ravens get some redemption, and the Browns finally win a playoff game 
 Good News Friday: A police officer pays for a family’s Christmas gifts, instead of arresting them for shoplifting. A high-school student and other kids put together an inspirational song. And a fist-bumping Canadian gets an awesome gift from strangers 
 Georgia on my mind! Both Dems prevail in the Senate runoffs, and we’ve got a Dem-controlled Senate. Yet more proof Bryan Cranston is awesome. And a disgusting display of favoritism, as it relates to vaccine distribution in Tennessee. 
 “The Queen’s Gambit” is as good as everyone has told you it is. Video. Trump, with another impeachable offense phone call over the weekend.And the NFL playoffs are set, and they could be wild. 
 Happy New Year! As 2021 starts, a final look back at the best of Good News Friday: A lawyer in L.A. starts a remarkable running club of homeless men. Two little best friends hug after not seeing each other for three months. And an African-American man, stung by police harassment, saves an officer’s life 
 The best of Good News Friday: The cast of “Hamilton” team up to make a little girl’s dreams come true in an amazing musical number. A wrongly-imprisoned man for 36 years wows on “America’s Got Talent.” And an 11-year-old girl in South Dakota touches hearts of postal workers with her letters.
