 Springpod was born from our desire to transform the way young people engage with employers and universities. We empower students to take control of their career path by connecting them with leading employers and education providers. From work experience placements to apprenticeships and beyond, we are determined to help students discover their future career through innovative and modern engagement platforms - even before they leave education. 
 We currently work with some of the most exciting organisations in the world including brands such as Airbus, the NHS, Jaguar Land Rover, AstraZeneca, EY, Deloitte, HSBC, and Vodafone. We're also partnered with leading schools, colleges and universities and are rapidly scaling with a view to expand internationally soon. 
 We're currently on the lookout for some enthusiastic and talented content executives to join us on a long-term contractual basis. In this role, you'll be responsible for creating and delivering content for our growing number of virtual work experience programmes. 
 Our team operates a hybrid working model, which means you will work from home at least 50% of the time. We have offices in London and Liverpool, so you must be able to commute to one of the offices when necessary. 
 What you'll be doing 
 
 Developing written content for our virtual programmes on a variety of topics including healthcare, technology, business, sports, law and much more 
 Creating programme briefs, outlines and storyboards 
 Compiling FAQs for the programmes 
 Building engaging and interactive activities such as quizzes and videos to complement the programme content 
 
 You'll also have the opportunity to work with clients across different industries and will be responsible for the delivery of content while adhering to strict deadlines. 
 Who are we looking for? 
 You'll be a creative and self-motivated writer who enjoys working in a fast-paced environment.  You'll have some previous experience of managing multiple writing tasks and deadlines. 
 The ideal candidate will have the superpower to transform complex articles and information into engaging content that resonates with the different audiences that we cater to - from young people aged 13-24 to careers teachers and business leaders. 
 You'll also be an excellent researcher with great attention to detail, who constantly seeks out innovative content ideas that can add value to our mission to empower every young person to make more informed decisions about their future. 
 
 Benefits 
 
 Fast-paced start-up environment with a lot of responsibility and autonomy 
 Competitive salary 
 Very sociable team with monthly team incentives
