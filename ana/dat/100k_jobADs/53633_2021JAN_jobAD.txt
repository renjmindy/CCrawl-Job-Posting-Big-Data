 The Work Design Worksheet for Dual Career Couples 
 This tool helps you envision paired proposals for flextime, remote work, and meeting-free zones that make your life together work. Design it to stagger your schedules to provide caregiving coverage, reduce commutes, protect time for critical meetings and even carve out a small block of personal time that will keep you feeling balanced and productive. Then look to see what parts you can just DO, and which you need to propose to your bosses for approval.
