 TATTOOED! 
 It's official. I now have my three tiny blue dots in place and next Monday I start my radiation treatments. ***** I'd like to say I was totally bad ass when they inked me, but I suspect yelling 'Ow' each time they poked me diminishes my street cred.

 Boob Job 
 July 26, 2019 Click Bait ,  Crisis DuJour ,  Family ,  Universal Coverage - In a Bad Way Boob Job kirizar 
 I'm finally getting around to taking care of a small matter of imbalance. It seems I've been a bit lopsided lately. Leaning a bit to the left, if you will. Turns out there's a reason for that! With the news the doctor gave me, I've decided to go ahead and have some work done. 
 I don't have all the details yet, but I wanted to keep you abreast of the situation; I'm having a little corrective surgery. Before you panic and start picturing me as a centerfold model in the next AARP circular. It's nothing  that  drastic. I've just reached  an age  where the fun-fun mammograms I've been having routinely for decades have finally paid off. They found something worth looking for. 
 To be honest, I've been waiting for something to happen for a while. Bad news comes in threes, and after the  tree killed our roof  two summers ago, and last year we experienced the dubious pleasures of salmonella and the  criminal justice system for minor children , I had the feeling the  Bad Sh*t Happens   Universe  wasn't finished with me. The trilogy was yet to be completed. ***** 
 I go through a few more medicinal hoops, ring a few more lab test bells, and the doctors schedule me for surgery in a few weeks. Now all I have to do is tell everyone I know the  good  news. 
 In a manner that suits my personality… 
 I want to have a last hurrah before picking my son back up from camp. I send out a hurried request for a Girls' Night Out. Friends join me at Noto's Restaurant on the beach. It's insanely busy and loud, but has a gorgeous view of Lake Michigan. We chat about everything-which includes someone introducing me to a term I've never heard of before. The friend mimes pulling an imaginary peanut M&M from her generous cleavage, saying, " _  Hashtag: Boob Snack _ ," and pretends to nosh on it. This seems like a great segue for my announcement. 
 I order a desert appropriate to the occasion. While handing out our choices, the helpful waiter, Chris, makes the mistake of asking,  " So, what's the big reveal?" 
 Bodacious Babe Drops the Bombe on the Beach! 
 In the spotlight, holding up my mounds of ice cream with cherries, I blurt.  " I have breast cancer!" 
 In the appalled silence that follows, the waiter escapes, and I hurry to explain. "It's really, really small! It's so small that finding it was very lucky." 
 It's like a micro-tumor. Only about 5-6 millimeters. And today I learned that it is moderately slow growing and is responsive to hormone therapy. I got a grade of Stage 1-A. Or as that doctor put it,"If you  have  to get breast cancer, this was the best kind to get." ****** 
 Hugs are given and I feel warm and fuzzy, especially after the waiter comes back to tell us he comped me my ice cream! A friend says we should go out more often…and I agree, adding, "We can take turns being the person with cancer to snag a free desserts!  Hashtag: Boob Snack !" 
 We leave the place cackling like mad women and tromp to the nearby beach to take selfies in the sunset. It was the best end to a day a girl can have, surrounded by loving, laughing ladies. 
 That's the news, everybody. I go under the knife on August 20th. And while I appreciate thoughts and prayers, I'm even  more  appreciative of thoughtfulness and practical help. Which leads me to my second bit of news. 
 Before any of this happened, I signed up to take part in something called  GISH  , an acronym for the  Greatest International Scavenger Hunt  (the World has Ever Known) which starts  JULY 27th . I've never done it before and, from what I understand, I will be performing acts of charity while dressed entirely in cheese, or some other wild suggestion, created by a team of very  disturbed  /imaginative people. 
 This brings me to you…my adoring friends, my extended family, and wacky Chicago fan club! ( **  Please note the use of the Oxford Comma per your request, K, J, and MJ! ** ) I hope I may call on you all in my hour of need. If I require someone to go out, dressed like sasquatch in a tutu, to serenade strangers on a street corner while playing a stringed bass (the fish, not the instrument) I am totally playing the  ' C'  card and asking for help. It's either that, or you get to mow my lawn for me. You decide. But, I'm totally milking this cancer thing for all it's worth. Consider yourself warned. 
 Tomorrow I get the kid back from camp. So, if I miss your kind words, know that I will look forward to reading them once life gets back to normal. For a given value of normal equal to infinity plus or minus the deviation of the norm over pie.*** 
 Asterisk Bedazzled Footnotes: 
 *The third movie is always the one where the hero wins in the end, right? So, it's all good. 
 ** Unless one could be diagnosed with unnaturally young and perky boobs after 50? It could happen. Right? 
 ***This is  not  a typo. MMmmmm…PIE!
