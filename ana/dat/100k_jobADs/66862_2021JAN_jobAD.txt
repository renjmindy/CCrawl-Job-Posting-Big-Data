 Automate the most painful part of our client on boarding process, the conversion of their existing data 
 Role overview 
 We have a bucket load of customers who all want our product yesterday. Good challenge to have right, only we canâ€™t convert all that data at a pace that our sales and implementation teams need it.â€‹ 
 Our Solution, build the tools for non technical people to drive it and focus efforts on the cool stuff..data lakes, analytics, bench marking etc. All based on AWS, step functions, EC2, RDS all controlled with Terraform. 
 Here's the pitch: 
 We're looking for a Senior Data Automation Engineer to spearhead the London team and partner with the the Auckland leadership group. Its a pivotal role that will help drive our future data strategies and grow our capacity to offer more value added services to our customers. 
 A month ago our global data team was 8 strong. During July we landed another 4 and now we're on the hunt for 5 more - by the end of August too! 
 We want to automate the most painful part of our client on boarding process, the conversion of their existing data. We have a lot of tooling here already but we are looking to really dial this in and take it to the next level (i.e. have it so rock solid non technical people can drive it). We are also going to have the data team working on lots of other cool stuff, data lakes, analytics, bench marking etc. All based on AWS, step functions, EC2, RDS all controlled with Terraform. Check out what  Matt our Senior Platform Architect  has to say about this space. 
 Our current process: 
 We regularly build for new source practice management software (PMS) and DB architectures â€“ working across  69+ custom scripts and operating on 40+ different db architectures. 
 Extract â€“ we have an app built in C# used to extract from the large number of scripts (> 45) the tools are designed to convert the source system into MySQL in raw format (i.e. what the data looked like in their MSSQL system) 
 Transform - PHP Data Conversion Script â€“ core framework built to â€˜standardiseâ€™ the conversion process, and components added custom to the script weâ€™re converting from 
 Load â€“ data piped up to production databases via an automated linux script 
 What you'll bring: 
 
 A hunger and excitement to lead, build, teach, learn and adapt 
 A development background with senior level database skills - potentially you're SRE and/or Devops focused. 
 Experienced with setting up a range tooling for automation 
 Expert knowledge of data modelling with large and varied data sets 
 Meticulous desire for performant code & tooling 
 Data testing, automated testing tools is a must 
 You read data models and comprehend database structures and relationships like Reddit threads. 
 Super strong computer skills and technical nous 
 Driven by initiative - performance orientated, multi-tasker and assertive when driven to action 
 
 Ideally you have experience in: 
 
 Leading, building and coaching data teams 
 AWS, C#, PHP, MySQL, Python, Jira, Grafana, Confluence, Slack 
 Data science & automation, machine learning & AI 
 
 Our London team is pretty small right now but we have big company growth goals and thereâ€™s lots of room for learning as we move from data engineering to automation engineering. We want more talented engineers/developers who code but love to play with data and wrangle technology to build efficient, and wherever possible, automated tools & processes. We're looking for energy and enthusiasm, people who can hit the ground running and love the thrill of a gnarly challenge.
