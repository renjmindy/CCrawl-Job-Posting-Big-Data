 Monday morning you sure look fine

 "Monday morning you sure look fine, but Friday I got travelin' on my mind," sang Lindsey Buckingham of Fleetwood Mac. Happy Monday everyone. 
 Of course, if I wanted to be downcast with the morning drizzle, I could have focused on Karen Carpenter's "Rainy days and Mondays always get me down." So, let's conclude a double negative is s positive and make it a great day. 
 Here are a few random thoughts for the week: 
 
 
 Whether you love or hate Speaker Nancy Pelosi, she is a worthy nemesis of the US president. She issued an open invitation to the president saying if you think you are being unfairly treated in the impeachment hearings, come testify. Inviting someone who has a hard time with the truth, would be sight to behold under oath. 
 
 
 Speaking of the untruthful one, after intimidating in real time one witness while sending a message to others on Friday, the president called one of Mike Pence staff members a "never Trumper" for testifying behind closed doors that the phone call with Ukraine president (which she listened on) was very concerning. So, as is his want, Trump labeled her as enemy of him, even though she works for his VP. 
 
 
 Please check out the yesterday's interview between Chris Wallace, the best journalist at Fox, and GOP Congressman Steve Scalise. Wallace grills Scalise for the purposeful white washing of the impeachment hearings being done by Republicans. Wallace has noted like other viewers that these witnesses are honorable and credible public servants. 
 
 
 This week will be even more telling as others testify. Whitewashing will continue, but we need to get back to that "oath" thing. Both Michael Cohen (Trump's attorney fixer) and Roger Stone (self-professed dirty trickster) have been convicted of lying under oath to Congress. 
 
 
 Let me close with this question. If someone is a self-professed dirty trickster, is that a public confession of "trust me at your own peril?"

 I guess I am just dumb as well

 Per The National Review, "Senator John Kennedy (R., La.) slammed House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi at a rally for Republican gubernatorial candidate Eddie Rispone in Louisiana on Wednesday. 'In three short years, President Trump has doubled the growth in the greatest economy in all of human history. And do you know what our Democratic friends have done for him?' Kennedy asked an arena full of supporters in the city of Monroe, Louisiana. 'Speaker Nancy Pelosi is trying to impeach him.' 'I donâ€™t mean any disrespect, but it must suck to be that dumb,' Kennedy said." 
 For now, let me mention and set aside the incorrect statement made by the Senator about doubling the growth of the greatest economy (which softened to 1.9% annualized growth last quarter) in all of human history and I won't even address that we are over ten plus years of consecutive month economic growth when the president has only been president for just shy of three years or that China and India have higher growth rates. Let me focus on the last statement. 
 Name calling serves no purpose and shows the author has a poor argument. From where I sit, let me mention a few things I posted on the Senator's website: 
 
 the US president has been credibly accused of abuse of power, obstruction of justice, extortion of a country for personal gain, and violation of campaign finance laws 
 these allegations come under oath by many well-respected diplomats and staff who have served multiple presidents of both parties 
 these testimonies have come at great personal risk by these public servants given the vindictive president and his syvophants 
 this is on top of the Mueller Report which did many things, but did not exonerate the president of obstruction of justice and confirmed he is untruthful. 
 
 I guess under the Senator's scorecard, that means I am dumb as well. Call me stupid, but I think we owe these public servants the same duty that they adhere to. Call me dumb, but I think Senator Kennedy's colleague Lindsey Graham is also forsaking his duty by saying he won't read the transcripts. 
 Well, I guess this independent and former Republican voter is just plain stupid. For some reason, I thought Senators swore an oath like these public servants did to serve the US constitution. 
 Love or hate Nancy Pelosi, she is at least doing her job. Senator, why don't you do yours. Stop worrying about keeping your job and do your job.
