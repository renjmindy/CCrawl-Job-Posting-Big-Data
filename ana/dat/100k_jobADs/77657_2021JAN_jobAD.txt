 Live and work in the heart of the beautiful Adirondack region for the summer. This posting is for the 2018 Late Spring/Summer Season -  IMMEDIATE OPENINGS!!  Family owned small boutique lakefront motels in the center of the Adirondack Park. We are seeking a work-camper couple for the 2018 Late Spring/Summer season. We are flexible on hours worked and days off but are looking for a conscientious, hard working, and motivated couple willing to spend 30+ days working with our team this summer. Our compensation package will include a FHU 30 AMP SITE, including water and sewer hookup, + free laundry room use, free WiFi, as well as limited usage of our canoes, kayaks, & small motorized fishing boat. We ask for a combined 15hrs work for FHU+, plus will compensate $$$ at competitive wage for additional hours worked. 
 We are seeking 1 couple to round out and compliment our DYNAMIC team!!! Ideally the couple should have a <30′ foot travel trailer as our site is best accessed and most flexible for smaller rigs. Summer in the Adirondacks is known for it's warm summer days, cooler nights, low humidity, and abundance of natural wonders. We are located in the very center of the Adirondack park directly on a 14-mile lake, with tons of lakes, rivers, streams and mountains to explore in the local area. Located near the high-peaks wilderness area and <1hr from Lake Placid and Old Forge gives you a wealth of activities to explore in your free time. Or just borrow one of our boats and paddle, motor, fish and explore our lake which is a gem for the water enthusiast. We ask applicants like us to be flexible in a dynamic environment & not be afraid of hard work. Housekeeping will be a requirement for 1 or both of the couple, and typically the man will perform duties associated with handyman, grounds-keeping, beach, boat activities. Some cleaning responsibilities may be required for both individuals. 
 Compensation for hours worked is FHU 30 amp site plus $$$hourly wage$$$, for additional hours worked. This posting is ideally for part-time/15-20 hours per week/per person. And, this is a work-camping position - not hosting job. Couples will share the same hrs/days off. If this fits your needs, please contact us directly. Please respond via email to:  sandypt@frontiernet.net 
 
 Jack's Note: Niki and I are very familiar with the Adirondacks and the Long Lake area is one of the most picturesque. A great opportunity that we would definitely look into if we were still work camping!

 Calling all Florida Work Campers 
 December 1, 2017  |  Snowbird RV Trails 
 Are you a Florida "Work Camper"? 
 We have just received a request from a German journalist who is coming to Florida and is planning to research a piece about "Workampers" - how they live, how they survive, how they celebrate life for the news magazine DER SPIEGEL. 
 He is looking for the best camping or RV sites in Florida to meet work campers who would "be so kind to tell me about their lifestyle." 
 If you are such a person or know such a person and would like to be interviewed, send me a note with where you are working and a brief note about your work and I will forward it to him. If you own or manage a campground or RV park in Florida that employs work campers send me a note.
