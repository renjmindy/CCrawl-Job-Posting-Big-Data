 The Company 
 We are a growing company based primarily on the south coast of England, with several members of the team around the world. 
 As a company, our purpose is to support people who find it difficult to control their online gambling activity by blocking devices from accessing gambling sites and applications. Our mission is to provide the most effective cross-platform gambling-blocking software possible to individuals and organisations globally, helping people take back control of their relationship with gambling. 
 As a team we are honest, transparent, responsible and supportive deliverers of positive change. 
 We have won several awards over the years, including Software Rising Star 2018 and RegTech Provider of the Year 2019.

 Collaborating with the support team to quickly and efficiently diagnose and resolve issues. 
 Writing maintainable code, with unit and integration tests where appropriate. 
 
 You will be working remotely and working closely with an exceptionally talented and geographically dispersed team.
