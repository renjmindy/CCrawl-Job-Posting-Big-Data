 Are you an experienced Quality Manager who can lead both Production and Systems Quality through significant improvement, for a complex, medium-volume manufacturer based in Halesowen? 
 This business is a UK leader in their field of expertise and has a strong order book despite current economic and operational challenges; typically led by their product groups first and foremost, the business is on a journey to World Class manufacturing, and investing significantly in people, plant and equipment to get there. 
 You will be key in ensuring that the current processes and systems are adhered to, with demonstrable experience working with ISO9001 and the agility to work with a number of specialist quality requirements on site. You will lead a small team of 5 and will develop & mentor your team to get the best out of them. 
 I'm looking for a leader who can help drive fundamental change in the way a business operates - you'll guide thought leadership, cultural change and process improvement/adherence in a business not used to working to World Class quality methods & metrics. You get real buy in from your peers and colleagues, in order to facilitate improvement across the business. 
 A background in a complex electro-mechanical assembly environment is a must; automotive and aerospace industry experience will both work, but you must be ready to join a business with lots to improve, willing to roll your sleeves up and get stuck in. You will have a track record instilling positive change in quality functions and the mindset across a factory, ensuring quality becomes a proactive function within the business rather than reactive. 
 This role will come with challenge but also autonomy and development potential, so this is an opportunity for anyone seeking to move their career forward and develop within an international organisation. If this sounds like you, please apply or get in touch with Paul Strachan on 07725-844784. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
