 Solo date ideas to look forward to 
 Posted on  17 March,2020  |  Leave a comment 
 I  read this post  and remembered how pre-baby I used to take myself out on may solo dates and how I need to start doing the same so I came up with a few ideas. (Obviously once things return to normal) 
 Key Art Mile . I have never been, it would be lovely to do a  #FirstThursday or just a regular evening. I have been to  Momo Kuro and LOVE the food. 
 Watch a movie.  I regularly get invites on  First Wednesday  movies and next time, I should totally go. 
 Reading Dates . This is a book meet up that happens monthly. I should go for the next one. Just sit in silence and read my book and then after get to interact with other bookies. 
 Baking a Decadent Dessert / Cooking an involved Recipe. 
 Ballet . I always see posters advertising different shows(?) at the Johannesburg Civic Theatre. It would be nice to try it out.

 How I want to make Adult Friends 
 Posted on  21 May,2018  |  4 comments

 I have a friend who is a maverick at making friends. One on one, she seems incredibly shy but I love her attitude to making friends and how deliberate she is about it all. So when I think to myself that I would like to make friends, I always think of some kind of organised activity that brings people together on the regular. 
 When I think of this though I always wonder how I would go about starting one because it involves putting myself out there in some way or another which is not exactly my thing. But, if / when I get over this hurdle, these are some things I would like to do: 
 
 Listen to a key podcast each month and then meet and discuss 
 Start an article club - pick  a Longread article  and then chat about it 
 Pick a cuisine and then assign various parts of the meal (starter, protein, desserts, salad) to different people and thus have a supper club or a  cookbook club  if you are fancier. 
 Good old Book club 
 Board games with a group of friends, I really have mine eye on  this one. 
 A cheese/ wine tasting club. 
 
 Do you live in Joburg, would you be keen to do any of this with me and meet some new people?

 The group, consisting of former workmates wishing to socialise on a regular basis, refers to itself by the acronym “ _  RASTA _ ” – this is derived from the first letter of each of our names. A distinguishing factors of the common employer lies in the fact that one of the perks is a hot lunch prepared for all employees and eaten at the main office, so it goes without saying that any other social engagement we undertook  HAD TO  revolve around food and consuming loads of it  ….. continue reading
