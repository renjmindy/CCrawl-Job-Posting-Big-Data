 If you're in college and find yourself looking for ways to earn an additional income, there are many online jobs for students available that will allow you to make the most of your skills, knowledge, and ability to earn some extra money. 
 However, while the Internet offers an abundance of opportunities for people wanting to  earn money online from home , finding genuine online jobs for students requires more than a casual glance over the many opportunities on Google. 
 Here at Work From Home Watchdog we have some advice that will help you to choose the best opportunity for you personally. 
 You are skilled…be selective 
 The fact that you are currently studying for a more advanced career gives you a current skill set that will allow you to pick and choose online jobs that others might not be qualified to take. 
 Use this situation to your advantage, and seek out online jobs that suit your particular skills. Jobs of this type generally require a higher level of ability, and they also tend to pay more per job than many other opportunities. 
 Examples of popular online jobs for students would be…translation jobs, computer programming jobs, writing jobs, proofreading jobs, graphic design, web design, and market research jobs. 
 Know your strengths and make the most of them! 
 Turn your spare time into earning time 
 It's tough for students to get into the mindset of working in their spare time, but if you're looking to earn some extra money in between lessons and study, then time management will be vital. 
 Look for jobs that allow you to be flexible with your working hours, and make sure that you allocate your spare time accordingly. 
 Also make sure that you do not take on any jobs that will potentially disrupt your study time. 
 This becomes something of a balancing act between completing your studies and earning more money, but at the end of the day your studies should come first.

 Avoid The Appeal Of 'Get Rich Quick' Opportunities 
 If you've had the time to read through the content on our website you will know that the Work From Home Watchdog team have so far failed to find a 'get rich quick' program that actually works, so take our advice and don't be tempted! 
 (You can read our tips section on spotting and avoiding online scams  here ) 
 Earning $1000's per day online (very quickly) appeals to us all, but the truth is you will often lose more money than you make from opportunities that make such bold promises. 
 From experience we all know that while it is very possible to earn a good income online, it simply doesn't happen without considerable effort over a period of time. Your time as a student is valuable so use it wisely! 
 Don't Just Look For Jobs…Advertise Your Services! 
 Many students believe that they can only find online jobs by searching the Internet, but did you know that there are many websites out there that will allow you to advertise your skills to people who require a specific type of worker? 
 Once again this benefits you as the student because there's every chance that your skills are required around the world by potential employers. 
 These websites will allow you to promote your skills to people/businesses around the world that require specific skills/abilities. 
 They are typically called 'outsourcing websites', and they remain one of the best sources for those searching for online jobs for students. 
 Remember that you have a distinct advantage as a student with an above average set of skills, so don't undersell yourself when looking for a job while you study. You will be pleasantly surprised by what you can potentially earn!
