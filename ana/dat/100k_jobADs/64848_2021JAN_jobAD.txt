 Best Employee Perks & Factors That Influence Job Satisfaction

 How People Actually Feel at Work These Days 
 Companies as a whole are making the move toward a more modern culture as Millennials and Gen Z begin to enter the workplace. This fresh wave of employees is changing the status quo and opening up a door to non-traditional workplace structures, interesting perks, and a willingness to work for a smaller company or a slightly lower salary in favor of a creative company culture. 
 Given this new trend, we wanted to know – how much do these new perks and innovative company cultures actually affect people’s morale? Does it really make a difference? Is this a trend to embrace or merely an option to be considered? We surveyed hundreds of people to find out. Here’s what we know. 
 
 As part of the campaign to offer perks to employees rather than just a paycheck to keep them around, we asked people what their companies offered them as an added bonus. The most common perk was flexible hours, followed by free snacks and tuition reimbursement. This shows us that companies are invested in trusting their employees to get their work done, rather than forcing them to work a set 9-5 day. The tuition reimbursement also tells us that companies are willing to make an investment in their employee’s education. 
 
 When asked to rank their job satisfaction, Government workers were the most likely to rank their job high. Real Estate and Marketing both followed suit with the highest rankings. On the other end of the spectrum, retail workers were the most likely to rank their job satisfaction low. 
 
 The job satisfaction by pay bracket tells us even more about people’s attitudes toward their jobs. Surprisingly, the highest pay bracket did not rank their job satisfaction as the highest. The pay brackets with the highest job satisfaction actually fell in the middle of the pack. The lowest job satisfaction was the lowest pay bracket, but the highest pay bracket was only ranked 2 spots higher. 
 
 The overall consensus was that if people are going to stay at a job they dislike, they want to be paid for it. This didn’t surprise us very much, simply because a job that people dislike naturally leads to working exclusively for a paycheck. It only makes sense that people would want their paycheck to be as big as possible. 
 
 Work/life balance is an important part of people’s satisfaction with life today. Just about 70% of people were satisfied with their work-life balance, and only 13% of people were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied. 
 
 Of course, no matter where you work, there will be days when the stress gets to you. Overall, women were twice as likely to be stressed out more frequently than men. 
 
 Communication is a key part of any successful workplace. Somewhat ironically, marketing professionals, whose job it is to communicate effectively to audiences, were by far the most likely to say that their team has communication issues. Financial professionals were the least likely to report communication issues. This might indicate that the more a team has to communicate to be successful, the more likely they are to experience issues. Naturally, a team that collaborates as marketing professionals do vs. a more clinical and individual style of work is going to have more opportunities for missed communication. 
 
 A major point of job satisfaction is the possibility of progressing within the company. The possibility of a promotion is often assumed but not completely made clear to employees by their managers. Overall, the technology employees and government workers were the most likely to say that their path to promotion was made clear to them and something they had clear steps to achieve. 
 Overall, the idea of working exclusively for a paycheck doesn’t really complete people’s craving for career fulfillment. Taking this into account, companies are offering more to their employees to help enrich their lives away from work vs. offering them more money to spend more time at work. Employees are embracing these perks and in response, committing themselves more fully to their careers. The system seems to be working well, and the trend continues to give companies the benefit of more fulfilled employees.
