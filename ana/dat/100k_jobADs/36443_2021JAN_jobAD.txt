 We believe that making the best possible use of the web is the way to turn useful data into valuable insights ðŸš€. Swirrl's PublishMyData software platform helps government organisations to make their data more accessible and re-usable, enabling better informed decisions. ðŸ”Ž Transforming how government finds data PublishMyData wraps your data in world-class search, browse and discovery technology. Users can explore by topic, map and natural language search. Specialists can also use details of vocabularies and classification schemes to filter data or use the full featured query language for the most precise or complex search requirements. ðŸ§  Transforming how government understands data PublishMyData helps you annotate, cross-reference and document your data, making it self-describing. All your users can rely on common clear, precise and consistent definitions of every term in your domain, allowing them to apply data with confidence. Datasets can be illuminated and enriched with explanatory notes and details of methodology. ðŸ”Œ Transforming how government connects data PublishMyData weaves your data into a graph, breaking it out of silos and joining it to other data from inside and outside your organisation to enable new connections and new comparisons. ðŸ“ˆ Transforming how government uses data PublishMyData makes your data ready to use anywhere: combine data sources to create custom spreadsheets on the desktop; syndicate the data into offline systems; power online apps and visualisations. ðŸŽ› Transforming how government manages data PublishMyData puts you in control of your data. Edit, transform, load, validate and publish your data in teams, or automate and integrate the process into code workflows. Be confident that your publishing is timely, trustworthy and reliable.
