In my latest article published by  U.S. News & World Report , I discuss the specific things that you can do to proactively prepare for a job interview and get yourself into the right frame of mind to succeed. Learn the importance of doing effective research and how to do it. Other keys to success are taking the time to prepare responses to foreseeable questions, practicing speaking about your strengths and weaknesses, and figuring out how to deal with the pesky compensation question when it comes up early in the interview process.
