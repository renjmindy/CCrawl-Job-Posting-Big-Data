 Just the beginning… 
 March 20, 2020 Eileen Kohan   2 Comments 
 So, the virus went viral, and nothing may ever be the same – job offers on hold, online classes the new norm, home the new workplace. 
 You may hear comparisons to 2008 or the dot com bubble of 2001 – 2002. There’s no comparison. We’re all pioneers in this new reality of social/physical distancing. 
 What to do? 
 First, reach out to the resources available to you through your network. There are a lot of unknowns. But you can only plan around the things you can control. 
 Second, go for a walk. We can still do that – at a six-foot distance. 
 Third, add something new to your day that connects you to others (with six-foot spacing). For me, that means joining a virtual book discussion of War and Peace:  #TolstoyTogether . Writer  Yiyun Li  in partnership with @APublicSpace is reading 12 pages a day. (Just started – anyone can join).  Robert Macfarlane  (Fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge) is also leading a global Twitter Reading Group, #CoReadingVirus, discussing  ‘The Living Mountain’ . 
 Fourth, contingency plan. #1 plan – the ideal job, #2 plan – other ways to gain experience in the same field, from a different angle, #3 plan – ways to have income, while seeking a permanent position. 
 It’s ok to be a bit scared. But to quote Swedish director Ingmar Bergman,  “The demons hate it when you get out of bed. Demons hate fresh air.”

 'Mind the Gap'- Managing Your Career in 2019 
 January 3, 2019 Eileen Kohan   Leave a comment 
 It's the first week of the new year and you're back @work, about to be consumed with the demands and challenges of your career. In a matter of months another year will have passed. What will a successful 2019 look like? 
 We each have a different concept of what that New Year's Eve IG might portray. How you get there depends on how well you maintain ownership of your career and stay on track to meet your individual goals. Follow these three steps and repeat every three months. 
 Identify your skills - Take a look at your resume and your job description. What skills did you bring to your current position? What new competencies have you acquired in the past year? (If you find you're no longer learning, it's time to change.) 
 Identify gaps - Take your list and compare it to someone you see as successful within your organization or field. If you're considering changing careers, what's the skill profile of a professional in the new area? 
 This assessment will give you a sense of the gap between your proficiency and aspiration. Check-in with a mentor for feedback on your self-evaluation. What are the best ways to fill the gaps: education, experience, professional development? 
 Monitor the market - Understanding your strengths as well as potential growth opportunities occurs in the broader context of the market. 
 Maintain currency with your field utilizing social media, professional associations and networking. If a career transition is on the horizon, begin to create connections through the same channels: social media, professional associations and networking. 
 Happy New Year! (And mind the gap.)

 Can we apply the architecture of March Madness to job search? 
 March 13, 2018 Eileen Kohan   Leave a comment 
 Let’s say you’re totally undecided (confused, terrified, ambivalent) about your next career move. All you know is you’re not happy with your current options. Where do you begin? 
 Try categorizing your interests using the bracket system. Instead of four regions, fill in four career fields that might interest you. Next, identify sixteen possible employers in each field. Once you have your potential employer roster identified, begin your research. 
 This may be a good time to develop a parallel list of contacts: a bracket representing your network. Use the same four career categories and identify folks who have broad expertise in the profession. In this ‘exploration’ phase you are aggregating data about industry trends, market leaders, and potential for growth. 
 As you progress with your data gathering, you will begin to eliminate some organizations in favor of others. Once you get to your ‘elite eight’ employers, schedule your in-depth information interviews. 
 As you talk to people you will begin to establish a realistic assessment of ‘organization fit’, and evaluate your chances for success. 
 The ‘elite eight’ forms your target list. By the time you have narrowed your selection to eight, you should feel comfortable that each employer presents a realistic starting point in the next phase your career. 
 As with any selection process, you don’t have total control. The employer extends the offer and you have the choice to accept or continue to pursue other options. 
 Add a little ‘March Madness’ to your job search, and some fun to a typically stressful routine.

 Martha Stewart's Thanksgiving/Job Search Advice 
 November 20, 2017 Eileen Kohan   1 Comment 
 With Thanksgiving only a few days away, it’s the season to consult  Martha Stewart  for job search advice. 
 In a book published in 2005 entitled  ‘The Martha Rules’ , Ms. Stewart defined ten essentials for achieving business success. Let’s focus on #8 –  “The pie isn’t perfect? Cut it into wedges – When faced with a business challenge, evaluate or assess the situation, gather the good things in sight, abandon the bad, clear your mind and move on.” 
 How do you apply this to your job search? Maybe the thought of competing in this economy is just overwhelming. Or, you’ve been going through a series of first round interviews and none have materialized into a full time offer. You have a business challenge. Time to assess you progress. What have you learned from the process so far? Are you focused on the rejections or the possibilities? 
 The job search is difficult. It requires a lot of hard work. You may be discouraged by rejection. Rather than focusing on the negative, use this holiday break as a point to leave the bad behind and as Martha says, clear your mind and move on. 
 To be successful in a job search today you need to honestly evaluate your strengths. What's your area of expertise? Which employers can best use your skill set? Don’t waste time on job listings that don't match your talents. If you find a perfect match, but the employer decides you're not qualified, move on to the next one on your list. 
 Which brings me to Martha rule #6:  ”Quality every day – Strive for quality in every decision, every day.”  There are no short cuts. Approach each new opportunity with the energy of your first choice.

 The week@work: the crisis of civic education, karoshi, unemployment & the future of office attire 
 October 9, 2017 Eileen Kohan   Leave a comment 
 This week@work stories examine the role of education in creating civil discourse, the consequences of karoshi, the impact of weather on unemployment and the future of office attire. 
 While walking through the  U.S.Capitol Visitor Center  last week I encountered a group of junior high school students who were shrieking at each other as they reported a sighting of House Speaker Paul Ryan as if he were a chart topping rock star. What if the majority of junior high and high school students had the opportunity to walk the halls of Congress and observe the process of governing? 
 Harvard president emeritus,  Derek Bok  examines  'The Crisis of Civic Education' . 
 " Schools have long been the primary source of civic education in America. As an early champion of public education, Horace Mann, pointed out more than 150 years ago: "One of the highest and most valuable objects to which the influences of a school can be made conducive consists in training our children to self-government. Yet schools cannot accomplish this task by themselves. Many studies have pointed to the difficulties that hamper their efforts, including inadequate funding and pressures on teachers from school boards, parents, politicians, and textbook publishers. In view of those problems, it is not surprising that the National Assessment of Educational Progress, which periodically evaluates the knowledge of America’s schoolchildren, concluded in 2010 that more than two-thirds of high-school seniors scored below "proficient" in their knowledge of civics and government." 
 Once the American high school senior transitions to college, there is no imperative to incorporate _" essential courses to equip them to perform their civic functions more effectively" _into their curriculum. 
 " While many colleges claim to be preparing citizens…and although they offer many classes and activities that can contribute to this end, few provide any required courses aimed at achieving that result. Instead, learning to become an active and informed citizen is simply treated as an option — much like preparing to be a doctor or a lawyer or a business executive — even though becoming a citizen is not a choice but a status acquired automatically by the vast majority of undergraduates." 
 Bok suggests a number of approaches: linking community involvement experience with academic coursework; connecting the dots between the activity and public policy, engagement with student government and establishing multi-cultural residence halls. 
 Colleges have a responsibility to lead on this issue. Colleges own this one. If not here, where? 
 " In today’s diverse and highly partisan society, it is particularly important to teach undergraduates to take account of contrary opinions and arguments and to discuss such differences respectfully. Most campuses are well positioned to encourage these habits…The recent election underscores the importance of extending such efforts to encourage interaction among classmates with different political ideologies and socioeconomic backgrounds." 
 Walter Sim  reported on  'Death by overwork: Will Japan finally face up to 'karoshi'? 
 " With her mobile phone in hand as if waiting for her next assignment, a 31-year-old political reporter with broadcaster NHK died of heart failure in her sleep in July 2013 after clocking nearly 160 hours of overtime the month before. 
 Two years later, on Christmas Day, a rookie at advertising giant Dentsu leapt to her death after being subjected to a gruelling schedule and harassment at her workplace. 
 The statistics nationwide are quite startling. Japan 's second annual karoshi White Paper, released last Friday, said there were 191 work-related deaths and attempted suicides in the fiscal year ending March 2017. This was two more than the previous year. In the same fiscal year, 498 cases of mental illness, such as depression, were deemed work-related. 
 And from January 2010 to March 2015, 368 suicides - 352 men and 16 women - were deemed as karoshi." 
 Patricia Cohen  reported  'U.S. Lost 33,000 Jobs in September; Unemployment Rate Dips to 4.2%' . 
 " Staggering from the impact of hurricanes that walloped Texas, Florida and neighboring states, the economy  lost 33,000 jobs  in September, the first monthly decline in employment in seven years, the government reported on Friday. 
 But economists discounted the discouraging report, describing it as a blip in a job market that was fundamentally strong. " 
 Wondering what to wear this week@work?  Jessica Holland  asks  'Are tracksuits and trainers the future of office attire?' 
 “They were all wearing trainers and layers of black,” says Evelyn Cotter, a career coach based in London. She’s describing a recent public speaking conference she attended, where the crowd of ambitious young professionals were dressed in a uniform way. 
 “Everyone had come straight from work, they were wearing black jeans and smart sneakers, but it definitely felt professional,” adds Cotter. “It’s a conscious style choice. It’s not just what you throw on to play with your dog in the garden.” 
 " The industry of ‘athleisure’ – sporty clothes and shoes that people don’t necessarily wear to play sport –  grew by a staggering 42%  between 2008 and 2015, according to Morgan Stanley research. More recently, its influence has begun to creep into offices, where workers’ clothing is becoming increasingly relaxed and designed for comfort. The Society for Human Resource Management, an international organisation, tracks how many employers allow workers to dress casually every day, and that figure rose from 32% in 2014 to 44% in 2016." 
 Before you head out to your favorite 'athleisure' retailer, check the culture and style of your employer. On days when you are meeting with clients, it's always a good idea to mirror the style of your customer. (or their expectations) 
 The last story this week@work, was the first story breaking on Monday morning. Folks taking a break from work at a music festival on a Sunday evening in Las Vegas became targets of a mass shooting. In twelve minutes  58 people  between the ages of 20 and 67 were murdered; 489 were injured. On Wednesday, the  citizens of Manhattan Beach , California gathered on a pier overlooking the Pacific to mourn two of the victims: Sandy Casey, 35, a special education teacher at Manhattan Beach Middle School and Rachael Parker, 33, a records technician with the Manhattan Beach Police Department. 
 This week@work consider how you might do more than send thoughts and prayers.

 The mysteries of networking #6 
 September 28, 2017 Eileen Kohan   Leave a comment 
 Does  networking  really take place in a galaxy far, far away? I think that's the way some of us approach it - a great excuse for not engaging in the process. And then, there's the whole ' mentoring  thing' - Do I need one? How do I find one? Then what do I do? 
 It's pretty simple. It's hard work. Actually, once you start the work doesn't end. You just need to recalculate the equation. It's not a chore, it's an amazing, fun exploration. And you can start today, with the folks in a college classroom, colleagues at work, members of your book club or athletic training group. 
 _" There's a Chinese saying: "Explore what's best in the others and follow." Among my friends, I always learn the best from them." _ Lee Shau Kee  _ 
_ 
 Think about that. _" Explore the best in others and follow." _Who are the 'best' in your world or the one you want to join? What are the qualities/values that align to win your vote as best@what they do? If you could have a few minutes with them, what would you ask? 
 The 'networking' thing is the exploration. Think about how you might go about planning for a hike, or travel. Why are you going? What do you hope to find? What research have you conducted to prepare? And, you're planning to have fun, right? 
 Apply the same process to networking.  " Explore the best in others…" 
 _" …and follow." _Once you have started a conversation, it's time to examine the next layer of career success. What has been the path to success? What were the failures, trade-offs, and recovery? How many detours came along the way? What do they look for in folks they hire? 
 Ask questions unique to your career aspirations. Your goal is to spark a longer conversation, one that may lead to a continuing professional relationship - a mentor. 
 " Among my friends, I always learn the best from them."

 The Saturday Read - 'The Undoing Project: A Friendship that Changed Our Minds 
 March 31, 2017April 1, 2017 Eileen Kohan   Leave a comment 
 The Saturday Read this week is the latest book from  Michael Lewis ,  'The Undoing Project: A Friendship that Changed Our Minds' . It's the story of Israeli psychologists  Daniel Kahneman  and  Amos Tversky ; two men who baffled colleagues at their pairing from the early days of their academic careers until the point when the public perception  " was now a Venn diagram, two circles, with Danny wholly contained by Amos" . 
 Reading 'The Undoing Project' I found myself underling and annotating as I went along, re-reading passages, flipping between chapters; engaged in an academic exercise vs. an enjoyable character-driven narrative. 
 It's the first time I've read a Michael Lewis book where I heard the voice of a Princeton alum more clearly than those of the two main characters. 
 Here's the strange thing, as painful as the first read was; I keep thinking about the practical applications of the pair's research long after the final page. 
 " The way the creative process works is that you first say something, and later, sometimes years later, you understand what you said." 
 Read something and sometime later you understand how it applies. 
 Both of these men had exceptional origin stories. Each was a genius in his own right. Each started out where we all do, with a certain degree of uncertainty about what to do with our lives. 
 For Danny,  " From the moment he thought what he might be when he grew up, he simply assumed he would be an intellectual. That was his image of himself: a brain without a body… He'd always sensed that he would be some sort of professor, and the questions he had about human beings were more interesting to him than any others. "My interest in psychology was a way to do philosophy…to understand the world by understanding why people, especially me see it as they do." 
 " Aptitude tests revealed Danny to be equally suited for the humanities and science, but he only wanted to do science. He also wanted to study people. Beyond that, it soon became clear, he didn't know what he wanted to do." 
 In an  interview  with  Stephanie Demming , published in December, he further clarified his path. 
 " My own love affair with psychology began after I graduated from university in 2009, as soon as I started working in the real world. It took all of two minutes to figure out the working world didn’t function like the school system. If you worked hard, you weren’t always rewarded. The new currency was whether or not people liked you. It was a system governed not by grades, but by people’s minds." 
 For Amos,  " Entering high school, Amos like all Israeli kids, needed to decide if he would specialize in math and science or in the humanities. The new society exerted great pressure on boys to study math and science. That's where the status was, and the future careers. Amos had a gift for math and science, perhaps more than any other boy. And yet alone among the bright boys in his class - and to the bemusement of all - he pursued the humanities." 
 " Hebrew University in the late 1950s required students to pick two fields of concentration. Amos had chosen philosophy and psychology.  But Amos approached intellectual life strategically, as if it were an oil field to be drilled, and after two years of sitting through philosophy classes he announced that philosophy was a dry well…There are too many smart guys and too few problems left, and the problems have no solutions." 
 Later, in his mid-forties he was asked by Harvard professor Miles Shore how he became a psychologist. 
 " It's hard to know how people select a course in life…The big choices we make are practically random. The small choices probably tell us more about who we are. Which field we go into may depend on which high school teacher we happen to meet…On the other hand, the small decisions are very systematic. That I became a psychologist is probably not very revealing. What kind of psychologist I am may reflect deep traits." 
 The career choices of these two individuals resulted in a collaboration that challenged conventional thinking on human judgement and decision making. 
 " A part of good science is to see what everyone else can see but think what no one else has ever said." 
 " Given the work on human judgment that he and Amos had just finished, he found it further troubling to think that "crucial decisions are made, today as thousands of years ago, in terms of the intuitive guesses and preferences of a few men in positions of authority." The failure of decision makers to grapple with the inner workings of their own minds, and their desire to indulge their gut feelings, made it "quite likely that the fate of entire societies may be sealed by a series of avoidable mistakes committed by their leaders."" 
 This was the book that Michael Lewis had to write. It was the origin story of his best seller 'Moneyball'. A writer is often compelled to follow his curiosity and tell the stories he finds as he explores the tangents. 'The Undoing Project' may not be his best narrative, but it's his best connection to the reality of the decisions ordinary folk face @work every day. 
 " I've always felt  ideas were a dime a dozen…If you had one that didn't work out, you should not fight too hard to save it, just go find another."

 The week@work - the war for talent, following vs. leading, exhaustion, and maybe we should ask a sociologist 
 March 27, 2017 Eileen Kohan   Leave a comment 
 The last state to approve the  Equal Rights Amendment  to the Constitution was Indiana in 1977 - until Thursday when  Nevada ratified  the ERA, thirty-five years after the deadline imposed by Congress. It was a welcome antidote to the White House photo of the freedom caucus taken the same day (above). Any odds on an extension to revisit and ratify? 
 " Nevada has given NOW President Terry O'Neill new cause for hope. "Now it's a two-state strategy," she tells the Times. "It's very exciting. Over the past five years, Illinois and Virginia have come close. I think there is clear interest in this. " 
 In other stories this week@work, journalists and experts provided an update on the  'war for talent' , offered an argument for  balancing  followers with leaders in the workplace, and expressed concern with a 'gig economy'  advertising campaign  that seemed to glorify exhaustion@work. The last story this week@work  re-examined  an idea from the 60's to establish a Council of Social Advisers to complement the Council of Economic Advisers in D.C.  " It's not just work; it's how work offers a sense of purpose and identity." 
 Dr. Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic  and  Adam Yearsley  believe  'The War for Talent Is Over, And Everyone Lost' . They cite workplace trends indicating more passive job seekers, the appeal of self-employment and the lure of entrepreneurship as competitive factors for employers to attract the best and the brightest, and offer a few best practices to turn things around. 
 " In 1998, after a year-long study on the subject, McKinsey researchers declared that a “war for talent” was underway. In the years ahead, they said, organizations’ future success would depend on how well they could attract, develop, and retain talented employees–an ever more valuable asset in ever higher demand. 
 Instead of winning a war for talent, organizations appear to be waging a war on talent, repelling and alienating employees more successfully than harnessing their skills. 
 Today, in a world full of many more Chief People and Chief Happiness Officers, that war nevertheless appears to have been lost on all sides. Of course, many workers excel in their jobs and make pivotal contributions to their organizations. But for every one employee who does, there are many more who are underemployed, underperforming, and just plain miserable at work. " 
 One of the employer prescriptions for success is to  " stop developing people's leadership skills" . 
 " …research suggests there’s a strong negative correlation between the amount of money spent on leadership development (which in the U.S. totals over $14 billion a year), and people’s confidence in their leaders. One of the reasons is that leaders are often deprived of negative feedback, even in training programs. We’ve gotten so used to coaching to people’s strengths that weaknesses get left unaddressed. The basics of human psychology magnify that issue; people are already prone to judging their own talents way too favorably, especially after experiencing a measure of success." 
 Which links neatly into the next story of the week@work,  Susan Cain 's  'Not Leadership Material? Good.The World Needs Followers.' 
 " Perhaps the biggest disservice done by the outsize glorification of “leadership skills” is to the practice of leadership itself — it hollows it out, it empties it of meaning. It attracts those who are motivated by the spotlight rather than by the ideas and people they serve. It teaches students to be a leader for the sake of being in charge, rather than in the name of a cause or idea they care about deeply. The difference between the two states of mind is profound. The latter belongs to transformative leaders like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Gandhi; the former to — well, we’ve all seen examples of this kind of leadership lately." 
 Jia Tolentino  used Fiverr's new ad campaign to illustrate  'The Gig Economy Celebrates Working Yourself To Death' . 
 " It does require a fairly dystopian strain of doublethink for a company to celebrate how hard and how constantly its employees must work to make a living, given that these companies are themselves setting the terms. And yet this type of faux-inspirational tale has been appearing more lately, both in corporate advertising and in the news. Fiverr, an online freelance marketplace that promotes itself as being for “the lean entrepreneur”—as its name suggests, services advertised on Fiverr can be purchased for as low as five dollars—recently attracted ire for an ad campaign called “In Doers We Trust.” One ad, prominently displayed on some New York City subway cars, features a woman staring at the camera with a look of blank determination. “You eat a coffee for lunch,” the ad proclaims. “You follow through on your follow through. Sleep deprivation is your drug of choice. You might be a doer.” 
 A Fiverr press release about “In Doers We Trust” states, “The campaign positions Fiverr to seize today’s emerging zeitgeist of entrepreneurial flexibility, rapid experimentation, and doing more with less. It pushes against bureaucratic overthinking, analysis-paralysis, and excessive whiteboarding.” This is the jargon through which the essentially cannibalistic nature of the gig economy is dressed up as an aesthetic. " 
 Maybe we need a few less economists and a few more humanists to address our life@work 
 There was a lot of discussion in the media this weekend in the wake of the health care bill defeat. What are the lessons learned? We might ask the same question about the November election result, only this time maybe we should be consulting with sociologists vs. economists.  Neil Irwin  asked  "What if Sociologists Had as Much Influence as Economists?" . 
 " For starters, while economists tend to view a job as a straightforward exchange of labor for money, a wide body of sociological research shows how tied up work is with a sense of purpose and identity. 
 “Wages are very important because of course they help people live and provide for their families,” said Herbert Gans, an emeritus professor of sociology at Columbia. “But what social values can do is say that unemployment isn’t just losing wages, it’s losing dignity and self-respect and a feeling of usefulness and all the things that make human beings happy and able to function. 
 … the  economic nostalgia  that fueled Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign was not so much about the loss of income from vanishing manufacturing jobs. Rather, it may be that the industrial economy offered blue-collar men a sense of identity and purpose that the modern service economy doesn’t." 
 At the beginning of this new week@work consider where work fits in your sense of identity and purpose. It's not just work.

 What should I do with my life? (in brackets) 
 March 14, 2017 Eileen Kohan   Leave a comment 
 The new president has declined to participate in March Madness this year. No filling in blank spaces to arrive at a prediction of the men's NCAA basketball champion. Maybe he's just looking at it the wrong way. 'Bracketology' is simply a means to eliminate options to arrive at the best decision. 
 Completing a NCAA bracket is the perfect 'trial run' for the other major decision we face - what should I do with my life? 
 With a little imagination, you can use the bracket concept as a decision matrix to manage career choice, job search or your network. 
 In 2007, sportswriters  Richard Sandomir  and  Mark Reiter  published  ‘The Enlightened Bracketologist: The Final Four of Everything’ , applying the methodology of March Madness to everyday decisions. 
 “Bracketology—the practice of parsing people, places, and things into discrete one-on-one matchups to determine which of the two is superior or preferable—works because it is simple. It is a system that helps us make clearer and cleaner decisions about what is good, better, best in our world. What could be simpler than breaking down a choice into either/or, black or white, this one or that one?” 
 How can we apply the scaffolding of March Madness to job search? Let’s say you are totally undecided (confused, terrified, ambivalent) about your next career move. All you know is you’re not happy with your current work situation. Where do you begin? 
 Try categorizing your interests using the bracket system. Instead of four regions, fill in four career fields that might interest you. Next, identify sixteen possible employers in each field. Once you have your potential employer roster identified, begin your research. 
 This may be a good time to develop a parallel list of contacts: a bracket representing your network. Use the same four career categories and identify folks who have broad expertise in the profession. In this ‘exploration’ phase you are aggregating data about industry trends, market leaders, and potential for growth. 
 As you progress with your data gathering, you will begin to eliminate some organizations in favor of others. Once you get to your ‘elite eight’ employers, schedule your in-depth information interviews. 
 As you talk to people you will begin to establish a realistic assessment of ‘organization fit’, and evaluate your chances for success. 
 The ‘elite eight’ forms your target list. By the time you have narrowed your selection to eight, you should feel comfortable that each employer presents a realistic starting point in the next phase your career. 
 As with any selection process, you don’t have total control. The employer extends the offer and you have the choice to accept or continue to pursue other options. 
 The NCAA tournament lasts three weeks. If you start filling in your career brackets now, you will advance through the exploration process at a pace to be ready for interviews by ‘tip-off’ in the championship game. 
 Its time to add a little ‘March Madness’ to your job search, and some fun to a typically stressful routine.

 The week@work - 'I'MPossible, steady job gains, robots, the multi-lingual advantage, and digital addiction 
 March 13, 2017March 13, 2017 Eileen Kohan   Leave a comment 
 This week@work a South African big wave surfer completed his  Atlantic crossing  via paddleboard, the U.S. unemployment rate dropped to 4.7%, research revealed speaking multiple languages restructures our brain, and the time you are spending reading this on your smartphone just may be a symptom of addiction. 
 What have you been doing @work since December 6, 2016?  Chris Bertish , an accomplished surfer, left Morocco on that Tuesday headed for Florida. John Clarke reported  'Chris Bertish Becomes First to Cross Atlantic by Paddleboard' . 
 " Bertish left the Agadir Marina in Morocco on Dec. 6. and planned to make the 4,600-mile, open-ocean passage unsupported and unassisted on a 20-foot stand-up paddleboard to Florida in four months. 
 He changed course south to Antigua because of low pressure systems and volatile weather, completing the 4,050-mile crossing in 93 days, arriving at 8:32 a.m. local time. Bertish averaged 44 miles a day — mostly at night to avoid exposure to the sun — and alternated between resting and paddling every two or three hours. 
 He made an estimated two million paddle strokes during the journey. " 
 In other good news,  Ana Swanson  examined the detail behind the unemployment figures,  'U.S. added 235,000 jobs in February; unemployment rate dropped to 4.7 percent'. 
 " The U.S. economy added a healthy 235,000 jobs in February, according to government data released Friday morning, surpassing economists' expectations and likely clearing the way for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this month. 
 The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.7 percent, compared with 4.8 percent in January, and wages rose by 6 cents to $26.09 in February, after a 5-cent increase the month before. " 
 In a related story,  Claire Cain Miller  offered strategies on  'How to Beat the Robots' . 
 " The problem, at least for now, is not that there isn’t enough work — there is, but it is very different from the kind of work technology is displacing. Manufacturing and warehousing jobs are shrinking, while jobs that provide services (health care, child care, elder care, education, food) are growing." 
 A number of elements in combination could establish viable competition with the robots: education that encourages flexibility and life-long learning, guaranteed basic income, profit sharing, and experimenting with non-traditional approaches to work. 
 Author  Gabrielle Hogan-Brun 's research has found  'People who speak multiple languages make the best employees for one big reason' . 
 " Speaking a different language—whether it’s your grandparents’ tongue or high-school Spanish—fundamentally changes the structure of your brain. Put a bunch of these malleable minds together in a company, and you create the potential for some truly original thinking. 
 Observations of multi-language work teams show that mixed-language groups have a propensity to find innovative solutions for practical problems. This is because they use a range of communication strategies in flexible and dynamic ways. When speakers from different language backgrounds work together using a common language, they draw on subconscious concepts that lie below the surface of the language they happen to be conversing in. 
 These findings show that bilingual people may have highly valued employment attributes: analytical thinking, conceptualizing ability, working memory, and dexterity. Clearly, these skills are assets when it comes to rational planning, managing complexity, and problem solving, which are central for executive function. " 
 Claudia Dreifus  interviewed social psychologist,  Adam Alter  to discover  'Why We Can't Look Away From Our Screens' . 
 " Why do you claim that many of the new electronic gadgets have fueled behavioral addictions?" 
 " Well, look at what people are doing. In one survey, 60 percent of the adults said they keep their cellphones next to them when they sleep. In another survey, half the respondents claimed they check their emails during the night. 
 Moreover, these new gadgets turn out to be the perfect delivery devices for addictive media. If games and social media were once confined to our home computers, portable devices permit us to engage with them everywhere. 
 Today, we’re checking our social media constantly, which disrupts work and everyday life. We’ve become obsessed with how many “likes” our Instagram photos are getting instead of where we are walking and whom we are talking to. " 
 In closing this week@work, this morning's  tweet  from Chris Bertish: 
 " As you head into the new week, remember the mantra that got me through 93 days on the Atlantic…Nothing is impossible, unless you believe it to be"
