 FAQ 
 Frequently asked questions. 
 When does the course start and finish? 
 The course starts as soon as you purchase it! You can do it on your own schedule, so there's no pressure to keep up with it. I know that many students will do this as part of their job. The reality is, that things pop up at work all the time. So, by keeping the course self-paced, it's easier to work it into your own schedule and life. 
 Will be enough time to practise? what to do if I have a full time job? 
 I know that you're likely trying to fit this into your work schedule, that's why we kept the learning videos bit-sized. We want you to be able to fit this into your existing schedule. 
 Do you have pricing for groups who want to take the course together? 
 Yes. If more than 10 people from want to take the CABIN CREW CAREER 1:1 COACHING, then please contact us at contact@worldclasscrew.com and tell us how many people want to take the course so that we can get back to you with pricing. 
 Do you offer any discounts? 
 We don't. But we recommend that you ask your employer to sponsor the course. We've seen many employers pay the full price or pay part of it for the students because they realize how valuable the skills are that students will learn and be able to apply to their jobs, immediately. Please   contact us   if you want a copy of this letter. 
 Will I receive a certificate? 
 Yes. If you attend and do all the modules, you'll receive a certificate of completion. The certificate is not meant to indicate proficiency or expertise as a certified cabin crew member. It is simply meant to communicate to your hiring manager that you went through all the modules. 
 Is there a money back guarantee? 
 Yup! I'm happy to offer a refund within the first 30 days after your date of purchasing the training if you are not able to attend the live session. I haven't had a single person ask for a refund yet. The course consistently receives reviews of 4/5 or 5/5 stars. So I hope you'll stick with the course and see the value that many other students have got from it. 
 Our trainees were recruited or are already flying 
 as Pursers, Cabin Crew, VVIP Flight Attendants, Business-Executive or Senior Cabin Crew for 37 commercial, private or executive airlines in Europe and Middle East
