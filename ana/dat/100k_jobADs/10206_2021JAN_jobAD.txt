Now, Bill is concerned that all the gaps in employment, as well as the frequency of job changes is making him look unreliable. Bill wants to “fudge” the dates on his  resume  so at least it looks like he had no breaks in employment. [poll id="74"] (  NEW!   Click here for the right answer .)  Image Credit: Shutterstock
