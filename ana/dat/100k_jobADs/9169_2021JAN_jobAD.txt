 The worlds best digital mortgage broker 
 Role overview 
 **  Help us set people free from the hell of mortgages ** 🏠🔑 
 You will become a domain expert by immersing yourself in the wider business to understand the mortgage market and the technology that underpins how we set people free from the hell of mortgages. In collaboration with the crew’s stakeholders, including product management, you’ll play a leading role in shaping the product and the work you and your teammates will deliver. 
 Our engineers work in cross-functional teams typically comprising of 7 to 8 people including product owners, designers and contributors which are empowered to meet their goals. We seek to give all our crews the resources and support they need with a minimum of constraints. 
 You have a delivery focussed mindset and make use of agile software development practices to ensure your crew’s success. We value collaboration, repeatability and continuous improvement. 
 We look for people who love to learn new things whilst using their existing skills and experience to enrich the engineering team. 
 As a senior engineer, your responsibilities will encompass (but not be limited to): 
 
 Driving the continued development of our codebase using a broad range of technologies cross our entire stack by writing well formed and properly documented code. 💻 
 Playing a leading role in the evolution of our system architecture, driving best practices and development processes throughout your crew and the wider engineering community. 🧬 
 Defining and delivering improvements to our culture of automated testing and specification. 🧪 
 Introducing and role modelling new tools and techniques that increase the speed of delivery, stability of our systems and drive an improved customer experience. 🔨 
 Collaborating with your crew’s stakeholders and product managers to shape the work that the crew undertakes being proactive in identifying issues with scoping and requirements. 🔎 
 Working closely with non-technical crew members to focus on building systems that directly serve our customers as much as possible and deliver simple solutions to complex problems. 🤔 
 Mentoring and growing our awesome engineering community by supporting the professional development of your crew and playing an active role in recruitment. 👨‍🏫👩‍🏫 
 
 We use lots of exciting technology 
 We value well architected solutions with reliable and maintainable code using the right software engineering principles above all else. Our engineers want to deliver the best possible solution they can and you will play a key role in ensuring our continued success in doing so. 
 We're big believers in using the right tools 🛠️ for the job to build the best software. Right now we mainly make use of functional programming, but are always evaluating our tools. Experience with functional programming or understanding of the functional programming principles is required for this role. 
 Our existing systems make heavy use of Haskell, PureScript and Typescript, Bazel and Nix as well as PostgreSQL. We deploy and operate our software using Docker and Kubernetes in AWS. 
 We believe in learning and development 
 Our engineers come from a number of backgrounds. We have self-taught team members working with graduates from universities and bootcamps alike. Some of us have worked in large corporations while some of us have only ever known startups. A portion of the team consistently enjoy full-stack work, others prefer to specialise in certain areas. While your role and crew might see you targeting certain areas of work, we see this only as a specialism. You can expect to be exposed to many other parts of our codebase and to learn about and participate in its development while growing your own skills and supporting the growth of other engineers in your crew. From regular talks and reading groups to sponsored meet-ups and conference attendance, we want to help take our engineers to the next level.

 -Enhanced maternity & paternity leave 👶 
 -Free healthcare and life assurance 💉

 For many, the process of getting a mortgage is hellish; hellishly complicated, hellishly costly and hellishly outdated. At Habito, we’re changing that. We believe people shouldn’t have to go through hell to get a mortgage. Since our launch in 2016, we have made it our mission to fundamentally change the way people finance their homes. Whether buying for the first time, remortgaging, moving house or buying as an investment, we have developed an award-winning service that puts our customers back in the driving seat, giving them greater control over their finances. We deliver industry-leading expert advice in real time, cutting edge AI-driven technology that gives them access to the best possible deals, plain English conversations and absolutely no fees whatsoever. We’re enormously proud of what we’ve achieved. Together, our 100-strong team has built great things to bring this mission to life. We’ve won numerous industry awards for our innovation, our talent and our service. And our enviable roster of backers is testament to that hard work and vision: to date, we have raised £27.5million in funding from some of the biggest names in venture capital and FinTech – Atomico, Ribbit Capital and Mosaic Ventures as well as the founders of Funding Circle and TransferWise. Most importantly, we’ve helped more than 160,000 people get the mortgage they deserve. Our proudest achievement yet is the love we get from our customers, borne out by consistently excellent TrustPilot reviews from more than 1,500 happy homeowners. But our work never stops. The landscape continues to evolve and, because we believe in financial products that put the customer’s interests first by design, we have ambitious plans to continue innovating, improving and disrupting in this space. As our business scales up, to extend beyond brokerage and insurance into becoming a mortgage marketplace, our focus on pioneering product and best-in-class delivery is greater than ever.
