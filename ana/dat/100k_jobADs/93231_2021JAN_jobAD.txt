 Finding Career Direction Can Be Emotional

 Today is the 7th and final day of a career exploration class I've been facilitating. During this time, the participants have been learning about themselves; examining their skills, values, beliefs and then looking at possible jobs and careers that fit best. 
 For some, it's been a confirmation that the direction they're heading in is the right one for them at this time. For others, something new has emerged. There's a several that have actually had multiple occupations come up and that's left them with some decisions to make. Finally, there are 3 for whom the course has left their future unclear; they've yet to get the clarity and direction they'd hoped for on the first day. Failure? Absolutely not! 
 Now you might wonder about those last 3. After all, if they came with the expectation of gaining insight into a career they could pursue and that's yet to emerge, why not consider their time a bust? Fair enough. Well, you see it's not a question of these 3 finding no job that interests them, it's more a question of still deciding upon an occupation that will best bring them overall happiness; a combination of what they do well, peaks their passion and returns financial reward for their labour. 
 Everyone in the class has in my estimation, entirely invested themselves in the process; giving thought to the questions asked of them and completing a number of assessments with a sincere trust in the process. Having conducted this class many times over the course of my career, I can spot a special kind of person; the one that takes this career exploration seriously and pins their hopes on an outcome that they'll then find meaningful; and this class was full of this kind of person. 
 And so yesterday, as we came to one of the exercises that starts the process of narrowing down which direction to move in for each person, it hit one person particularly hard when they realized the clarity and direction they'd hoped for hasn't yet materialized. Tears came, and they removed themselves for a few minutes twice in order to collect themselves. If you think people on social assistance are lazy, unmotivated and are happy to sit back and not work, you'd have a very different view had you sat in on the group yesterday at this moment. 
 When tears come out, it's embarrassing for the person much of the time, but it's actually a clear sign of how much things matter. If the person didn't care; they'd just taken the class because they were made to or saw it as something to do for awhile, there'd be no tears because their was no emotional investment. Because the tears came out, that's a clear indication to me that this career / self exploration stuff matters; that the person still believes THEY matter. 
 We all have barriers to success. That's not a question but rather a statement. Whether we share them or keep them private, there are things that stand in our way; education we lack, skills that are rusty or not improved upon, experience that we lack, a criminal record we don't have the funds to erase, an inability to decide between very different jobs and careers. We might lack transportation, have child care issues, anxiety, low self-esteem, fear of making another poor choice and ending up in an unsatisfying job, perhaps a disability; physical or mental. 
 And as long as were talking barriers, most of us have more than one. In fact, some of us have multiple barriers and they are the invisible kind. While others look at us and can't see them immediately, they are so very real and huge to us that we feel everybody knows ours. Truth is, most other people are concerned with their own issues they don't really see the ones we feel are on display for all to see. 
 For those still struggling to gain some direction, the feelings can be so intense, they see themselves as a failure - again. With the pressure they may be under in the other parts of their lives, this they'd believed, would turn out better. Well, it will. Really, I believe this. There is no prescribed 7 day fix that a course magically promises everyone. On day 1, I actually warned people I wouldn't stand before them and tell them what they'd be. That is for everyone to find for themselves and while it may take 7 days for many, more time is needed for others. 
 What of you? Do you know where you're headed job-wise, career-wise? Are you satisfied with that direction? Are you confused, anxious, afraid of moving in the wrong direction so you put off making a decision altogether? 
 There's a cost to being indecisive and time passing will rob you of your current references, the benefits of your experience as your skills sit idle. Your confidence will ebb with a lengthening unemployed gap on your resume. And which is better for you, a job or a career? Both have value and both are the right choice depending on where you're at. 
 Knowing yourself better is a great start. Look at your assets; skills, experience, education, contacts, likes, dislikes, problem-solving and learning style, just to name a few things. Knowing who you are is a key. 
 Looking at jobs and careers that match and working through your barriers will get you where you want to be. 
 YOU matter.

 A very well written article. The issue of “barriers” is very real. One may even knock down barriers of their own only to find other obstacles in the way.Always push forward, and never give up. You never know what is around the next corner!
