 A Crockwork Orange 
 From  THINK PROGRESS : 
 
 A few months ago, House Republicans launched an effort called  Americans Speaking Out , which purports to give average Americans the ability to offer their input on what Congress should do. It became quickly apparent that the enterprise was little more than a  taxpayer-funded PR gimmick  to help Republicans market their agenda for this fall’s elections, even as they  ignored any ideas  they didn’t already support. Now, under the banner of Americans Speaking Out, House Minority Leader John Boehner (R-OH) has summoned advice from those who he truly seems interested in listening to: lobbyists. Roll Call reports that Boehner has invited “senior Republican lobbyists and top officials from several large trade groups” to a meeting at Boehner’s office to discuss “ their suggestions for a new GOP agenda ” […]

 They've Already Infiltrated the Infantry! 
 From  POLITICAL CORRECTION  (June 25, 2010): 
 
 Speaking on the House floor last night,  Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX)  continued his assault on common sense by making the generally nonsensical claim that terrorists were recruiting pregnant women in order for them to have U.S.-born children who would, several decades from now, attack the United States and "destroy our way of life." Gohmert made the comments while discussing border security and Arizona's controversial new immigration law. 
 
 
 Gohmert:  I talked to a retired FBI agent who said that one of the things they were looking at were terrorist cells overseas who had figured out how to game our system. And it appeared they would have young women, who became pregnant, would get them into the United States to have a baby. They wouldn't even have to pay anything for the baby. And then they would turn back where they could be raised and coddled as future terrorists. And then one day, twenty…thirty years down the road, they can be sent in to help destroy our way of life. 'Cause they figured out how  stupid  we are being in this country to allow our enemies to game our system, hurt our economy, get setup in a position to destroy our way of life.

 Kentucky BluegrASS 
 From  POLITICO : 
 
 Senate Democrats spent Thursday night hammering away at Sen. Jim Bunning (R-Ky.) for single-handedly holding up action in the upper chamber – but he blurted out a message to one of them on the Senate floor: “Tough s—t.” 
 In an unusual display in the normally sleepy chamber, Bunning – without the support of GOP leadership – has blocked efforts to quickly approve a series of extensions to measures that would otherwise expire Sunday, including unemployment insurance and the Cobra program that allows people who lose their health benefits to continue getting coverage.

 One hand taketh, the other stab-eth in the back 
 From  The New York Times  : 
 
 WASHINGTON — With the Senate poised to take a first test vote on a jobs bill, governors said Sunday that they still needed assistance from the federal government but urged Congress to focus more on creating jobs in the private sector. 
 Governors were sharply divided on the merits of the $787 billion economic stimulus bill adopted by Congress last year with strong support from  President Obama . And their differences colored their views on proposals for another round of job-creating legislation. 
 A handful of Republicans, including Gov.  Tim Pawlenty  of Minnesota, denounced the 2009 law. 
 It was largely a “waste of money that is now sustaining government at a time when we need to be shrinking government,” Mr. Pawlenty said on the  NBC  program “Meet the Press.”

 Buh-Bye Bayh! 
 From  abc NEWS : 
 
 Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh announced today that will not seek a third term -- a huge blow to Democrats and an opportunity for Republicans to pick up another Senate seat in 2010. 
 "There are better ways to serve my fellow citizens," Bayh said at a news conference this afternoon. "I love working for the people of Indiana. I love helping our citizens make the most of their lives, but I do not love Congress."
