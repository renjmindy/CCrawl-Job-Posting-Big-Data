 Nene Leakes Talks LEAVING RHOA & Her Rising Acting Career With The New York Post 
 
 RHOA  mega superstar, actress and business mogul Nene Leakes turned her 15 minutes of fame into a multi-million-dollar empire that includes real estate, a restaurant and a shoe line. She does a great job at branding herself. Love her or hate her, she is "very rich"!  RHOA  is only the beginning for Leakes. She is now a rising actress that had starring/leading roles in  The New Normal  ,  The Apprentice  and  Glee . A few months ago, Leakes signed with Global Brand Licensing Agency Beanstalk with plans to launch a line of clothes, beauty, hardware and jewelry in department stores nationwide. In an interview with the  NY Post , Leakes talks about her TV obsession, acting career, leaving  RHOA  in the near future and doing a __ Housewives  all-star edition. Below are some excerpts: 
 What’s your TV obsession right now? 
 I am obsessed with trash TV. I watch all reality shows. I watch all the “Housewives.” I am a huge fan of “New Jersey.” I like that Teresa [Giudice] and her sister fight. I hope they continue to fight. I hope they never like each other. 
 As your acting career  gains traction, do you slowly want to get away from reality? 
 At some point I do. I love the acting world. So at some point. . . I can’t continue to be a Housewife. At some point, I have to back out. 
 How much does “The New Normal” challenge your acting range. Do you get to mostly be funny? 
 There is a lot of drama with me. Like you didn’t know that! 
 Have there been opportunities you have missed because of your reputation from “Real Housewives”? 
 Probably. I don’t know that for sure. Just the thought of me being a “Housewife,” they would probably say “Hmmm. We may not want to use her.” Just the whole persona of being a Housewife. The cattiness and the bitchiness and the fighting. People see you as that is who you are. 
 If they did an all-star “Housewives” edition, who would you like to see on it? 
 I would probably do me, Bethenny, I like Jill Zarin even though she’s not there. I think she is everything of New York City. Her accent and everything is just great. I would probably grab Gretchen [Rossi] from “Orange County,” Teresa from “New Jersey,” and we could work it out.
