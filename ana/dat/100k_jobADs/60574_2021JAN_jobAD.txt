 How to get an entry level role in mining 
 BY: Tracey Mesken28/10/2019 
 ​Entry-level mining roles do come by rarely and usually receive 1000’s of applications, so it can be very difficult to secure a role. Find out how to get started with WorkPac and apply for entry-level roles.​Getting StartedBefore applying for any positions, register with WorkPac, then complete the following steps:Fill out your personal details (this includes Name, DOB, contact details and your address)Provide an up to date resumeLet us know your work preferences so we can best match you with roles – this involves letting us know your current/last role and industry, your preferred industry, and your preferred Business Centre so we can assign you your recruitment coordinatorFill out the Lastly, enter in your relevant work history and provide us with at least two refereesOnce you’ve registered call your nearest business centre on 1300 967 572 so you can discuss what you’re seeking with one of our recruitment coordinators. You can also find your nearest business centre on Skills, experience, ticketsIf you’re looking for entry-level/trainee mining roles, we do not recommend completing training courses as most clients will want to train you themselves.To work on a mine site, you will need:Standard 11Be able to pass a drug and alcohol testDrivers Licence: Requirements for this can differ from site to site (manual/automatic/provisional). They must always be valid and current, always check.National Police Clearance (for some sites)Proof of Right to Work: This can be a driver’s licence, birth certificate and/or passport etc.Coal Board Medical (cost is covered by WorkPac, this is for coal mine sites only)Beneficial Tickets/LicencesThere are other tickets and licences that may give you an edge when applying for entry-level roles:Blue/White Construction CardOH&S Tickets for Civil equipment i.e. Bobcat, Excavator, Roller etc.Trades Papers/LicencesSkills List/CompetenciesWorking at HeightsConfined SpacesLow Voltage/CPRRII Dump Truck TicketWhat you need to bring to an interviewIf you do get an interview for an entry-level role, you must have:Completed the online registration processUploaded your resume with two referencesUploaded your Right to Work documentsDrivers LicenceStandard 11 (if relevant and if you have it)Current Coal Board Medical (if you have it)Black Coal Competency or Site Authority paperwork (if you have it)Where are the jobs? The following WorkPac Business Centres recruit for roles in mining. For info on upcoming mining projects across Australia, head here.Coal mining:BiloelaBlackwaterBowenEmeraldGunnedahHunter ValleyMackayMoranbahMuswellbrookIron ore mining:KarrathaNewmanPerthPort HedlandTom PriceOther mining:CairnsKalgoorlie Mt IsaDarwinRoxby Downs Q&AHow long will it take to get a job in the mines?Entry-level mining roles do come by rarely and usually receive 1000’s of applications, so it can be very difficult to secure a role. Therefore, persistence is the key to getting in, and it’s very important to build and maintain a relationship with your Recruitment Coordinator so that you stand out when roles do become available.It’s also important to note that FIFO roles are generally only offered to experienced operators. So, those able to live locally to a mine site or close enough to commit to DIDO (drive in drive out) / BIBO (bus in bus out) roles will have more opportunities.Is there anything else that will give me an advantage?Those who live in towns near mines and those willing to relocate for mining work will have a greater opportunity of getting into the industry.We also recommend networking as best you can with those within the industry. Sometimes having a valuable contact on-site can secure you your first mining opportunity.What is it like to work on a mine site?This will vary a lot depending on the role and the location. Some roles will require you to live in a regional or mining community near a site. While DIDO roles will require you to live within a reasonable driving distance of the site, often buses are provided from camp to get you to the mine site.Shift rosters will vary between sites but will generally operate on an “even-time” cycle (i.e. 4 days on/4 days off or 7 days on/7 days off), though some sites do have roster cycles that will require you to be away for extended periods of 2-3 weeks before returning home on a break. Again, this will all depend on the role and the site.What’s the difference between a green/entry-level operator and a traineeship?Both are terms used for new to industry roles, in which no prior mining experience is required, and since there isn’t assumed knowledge or experience you will be receiving training and mentorship on site. However, the biggest difference between the two is that a traineeship is a formal training program, running over a set period with a clear end goal of earning a nationally accredited qualification.Where can I get more information?If you were seeking more information, we’d recommend checking out the following webpages:WorkPac Mining JobsWorkPac's Guide to Coal Mining for Operators​

 How the right mindset and attitude can lead to a permanent role at Rio Tinto 
 BY: Tracey Mesken26/11/2018 
 ​WorkPac would like to congratulate Marley, one of several WorkPac employees at the Mesa A site who have gone permanent with Rio!​In late 2017 WorkPac and JobTrail underwent a recruitment drive in the Pilbara region focused on offering young Indigenous job seekers who were interested in mining a pathway into the industry. Marley was part of a Robe Valley assessment centre run by the JobTrail team where he was a standout candidate and landed a role as a trainee operator on site at Mesa A.Throughout his entire traineeship Marley’s work performance has been of the highest level and he has been a great team player. Our Site Manager for Mesa A, Kath Collins, caught up with Marley’s Supervisor Dean to learn more about what earned him a permanent position.“Marley is a positive young guy. He is a very productive worker and is always the first to put his hand up for other jobs when the trucks are down. He is a real go getter of a young bloke, and that is why we progressed him. Everyone in the team speaks highly of him. I am confident that Marley will be a great asset to our team and will go a long way with Rio Tinto” he said.When asked what advice he would give to other young people looking for a career in mining, Marley emphasised the importance of keeping a good attitude on site.“Definitely, the number one thing is to have a good attitude. Don’t let the information overload get to you or overwhelm you at first- because there is so much to learn! … There is a lot of adjusting to do at first, but ease into it and be willing to keep an open mind about it all. Be willing and eager to learn, be flexible, and give everything a go!”Kath also spoke with Marley about the best parts of the job, who spoke highly about the Mesa A site and crew.“I would have to say the People, I work with a great bunch of people who make it enjoyable to come to work and catch up. Mesa A is a great Site. The crews are pretty small, so you get to know everyone really well, and feel part of a close team. I felt part of the team from the moment I got out here. Finally, it is a great learning environment, there is always something new learn, and Mesa A and the managers are really encouraging of that”Marley is a fantastic example of how the right attitude and mindset can lead to great things, and a great role model for all those looking to crack into the industry. We would like to wish him the best of luck as he continues his mining career with Rio Tinto- we’re sure he’s going to go far!

 WorkPac opens a new recruitment office in Perth as their work with Rio Tinto continues to grow 
 BY: Tracey Mesken24/10/2018 
 ​Previously working from the Perth office, WorkPac’s Rio Tinto Project Services team have moved to their own space.​Australia’s largest privately-owned recruitment company WorkPac have opened their second office in Perth, the city where they opened their first business centre in 1997.The second office is dedicated to WorkPac’s Rio Tinto Project Services team, who manage recruitment for Rio Tinto Iron Ore.The Project Services team was created in 2017 as a dedicated team servicing Rio Tinto and have since shared an office space with the Perth Business Centre, but as both those teams have continued to expand the need for a new location became apparent.Business Centre Manager for Project Services, Mr. Dennis Blewitt, said the move is telling of how far WorkPac has come since it was first founded.“Perth is the city where WorkPac was founded, and now 21 years and over 40 business centres later, it’s a proud moment for everyone that we’re opening our second office here.”“It’s also an especially proud moment for myself and my team, as a reflection of all the hard work we’ve put in over the past year.”“This move is not only going to give us the space we need now, but room to continue to grow in the future.”“Having our own space separate from the Perth office is also going to make it easier for candidates to find us for interviews and training”.Mr Blewitt is looking forward to continuing working with both Rio Tinto and job seekers in WA.“We’re very fortunate to have Rio as one of our major clients, and our partnership will continue to focus on finding great roles for great people with an Australian icon”.“I look forward to continuing to provide them with the best service possible”.The new office is in the same building as the Perth Office at 31 Ventnor Avenue in West Perth, with the Perth team being located on level 3 and the Project Services team on the ground floor.Those looking for work with Rio Tinto in the region can get in touch with the team at riojobs@workpac.com or by calling 1300 498 559.Anyone seeking staff in the Perth Region is encouraged to check out our page on Recruitment in Perth

 Women In Mining Infographic 
 BY: Tracey Mesken08/05/2017 
 ​Women in mining only make up 15% of the sector. We know as an industry we have to do better and if we want things to change it's up to us to lead the way.WorkPac surveyed 675 women in Western Australia to understand what attracts them to the mining industry and what their work preferences are.These results will shape recruitment strategies to increase participation of women in mining the workforce.Our Women in Mining infographic shows what they said ... WorkPac together with Fortescue Metals Group, a global leader in the mining market, are reaching out to women who have ever thought about a career in mining or who are considering a return to the industry. Click here to register your interest in working for WorkPac at one of Fortescue Metals' mines. Why is this important? Why is it critical to have women in mining? Gender parity in the workplace is not only an issue of fairness but is about attracting the best talent. Women account for half the world's population and if they don't achieve their full economic potential, our economy suffers, says the McKinsey Global Institute. If you're excluding half the population from your recruitment process, you're simply not hiring from the best talent pool available. A study by the McKinsey Global Institute finds that the world economy could add $12 trillion in growth over the next decade if countries meet the best-in-region scores for improving women’s participation in the labor force. The Credit Suisse Research Institute found that companies with female directors on the board outperformed all-male boards across growth, productivity and return on equity. This doesn't just apply to our boardrooms. Teams with lower percentages of women have lower sales and lower profits than teams with a balanced gender mix. Performance and productivity is higher across gender neutral crews, teams and departments.The correlation between gender balanced teams and financial performance is addressed in many studies, examples can be found at the Australian Government's Workplace Gender Equality Agency and Harvard University's Kennedy School to name a few.Last year, Fortescue Mining Group appointed two new female directors, former Leighton executive Penny Bingham-Hall and Deloitte partner Jennifer Morris, to replace two men retiring from the board.Six of the 10 board of directors are women and Fortescue’s chairman and founder, Andrew Forrest, told Women's Agenda that the diversity of the board has been critical and "a natural evolution" for the company.Fortescue’s share price grew by 400 per cent in 2016 and Mr Forrest says while merit-based hiring is a given, "diversity is an extremely strong factor in merit. If you have no women on your board and you are looking at a new director with approximately equal skills, for the sake of your shareholders choose diversity."Interested in mining jobs in WA?

 NRL legend Scott Prince joins the WorkPac Group to deliver Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employment program in Queensland 
 BY: Tracey Mesken03/03/2017 
 ​Scott Prince, new ambassador for Indigenous employment program, Murri’s in the Mines, is encouraging Indigenous WorkPac employees to complete their traineeship and build a career in mining.15 Indigenous participants have started their Certificate III in Surface Extraction at Rio Tinto’s Hail Creek Mine in Central Queensland.WorkPac and its Indigenous division JobTrail is delivering the program with mentoring provided by Traditional Owners and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Community Health Service.Murri’s in the Mines ensures Indigenous trainee operators have the right support at home and in the workplace to finish their traineeships and grow their careers.Scott will go onsite as the program’s ambassador, meeting with participants and their supervisors to provide support and motivation to the 15 trainees currently completing the program.Scott says he got involved in the program to support and encourage Indigenous trainees to be successful in their pursuits in the mining sector.“I think that like footy, the workplace offers individuals the opportunities to perform and succeed, but it’s not without challenges,” Scott said.“My father Les was a miner in Mount Isa, without his hard work, I wouldn’t have been able to pursue my football career.”“I’m proud to offer support to these guys and girls who are starting out in mining. I’ve seen first-hand with my dad; a mining career really helps provide for your family and gives back to your community and hopefully we’ll see another Maroons halfback come out of a mining town.”Scott’s work as an ambassador for Indigenous community programs demonstrates his strong commitment to increasing Indigenous participation in the education, training and employment space, says JobTrail National Manager, Julian Genn.“Being a proud Aboriginal from the Kalkadoon tribe in the Mount Isa region makes Scott someone our participants can relate to and look up to,” said Julian.“Scott is a well-known ex-NRL player and his profile will bring exposure to the program and help increase employment in the local Indigenous community”.​To learn more about WorkPac’s Indigenous division JobTrail, click hereTo download a copy of our Reconciliation Action Plan, click here

 WorkPac Miner on My Kitchen Rules Tonight 
 BY: Tracey Mesken01/02/2016 
 ​Image courtesy of Seven Network. My Kitchen Rules brings us a smorgasbord of characters tonight as the seventh season launches after the 2016 Australia Open tennis.WorkPac's very own FIFO miner Alex and his best mate Gareth are representing Queensland, affectionately dubbed the Miner Diners.​The Miner Diners hope to transition from the mining sector to the restaurant business and say despite their blue collar day jobs, they won't be serving up "pub grub"."We have been saving money from our jobs in the mines so that we can open something of our own and we’re kinda hoping MKR will help fast track it. Like a bar and grill type of atmosphere, where you meet your mates and serve food that we like cooking," said Alex.Alex and Gareth love Asian cuisine, roasting meats and and describe food as "a bit of an artwork".The competition in the kitchen is fierce and the boys come up against the show's villain but with the MKR theme, "real people real food" our Aussie miners are as genuine as you get.In support of Alex and Gareth's culinary adventure, WorkPac is bringing you a month of food content as we follow the boys on MKR.We'll be serving up WorkSnacks, lunchbox ideas for tradies, summer BBQ recipes, healthy food solutions for FIFO workers, bite-sized nosh for the footy season and beer-based dishes.To follow Alex and Gareth's My Kitchen Rules story, tune in to Channel 7 at 7:30pm tonight and subscribe to the WorkPac blog and Facebook page.
