  Career Prep: New Job Can’t Be Done in Time Allotted  
 Work It Daily 
 November 04, 2012 
 Job search takes practice – just like studying for the SAT. That’s why we came up with daily  Career Prep  questions to help you “study” for your job search! Here’s today’s question: Christa is a recent grad who just got a  new job  at a start-up. Within two weeks, she is miserable and wants to quit. The problem is the workload. She was hired to work 40 hours per week and has been explicitly told she cannot work overtime. Yet, the amount of work that needs to be done is taking far longer than the 40 hours. Christa can tell her boss feels she is not working fast enough, but Christa can’t see how to work any faster. Her boss used to do her job and says it's possible. [poll id="81"] (  NEW!
