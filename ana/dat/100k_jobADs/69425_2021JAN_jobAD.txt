 Find Government Jobs in Pakistan on Jobs Dunya 
 On  June 1, 2019July 17, 2019  By  onepakistanworld 
 One of the main purposes of launching  Jobs Dunya  last year was to facilitate thousands of graduating students in landing a Government job. In Pakistan both Federal & Provincial governments announce hundreds of thousands jobs each year, Jobs Dunya is one of the very few portals which organizes these vacancies by location, qualification and organization. 
 The main organizations covered in depth are all the Public Service Commissions in Pakistan including FPSC, PPSC, SPSC, KPPSC and BPSC along with testing services agencies such as NTS, PTS and OTS. Armed forces jobs are also updated in addition to federal and provincial government jobs. Candidates can not only find jobs but those candidates awaiting results for tests and exams conducted by these organizations can get updates for results on Jobs Dunya. 
 Join us by subscribing to latest jobs alerts from Jobs Dunya at jobsdunya.com/free-jobs-alert  and never miss an update for Government jobs in Pakistan.
