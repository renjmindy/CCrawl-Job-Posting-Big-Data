 The following positions are marked as remote, though we are looking for people primarily in Akron, Cleveland, and Columbus, Ohio. Our clients are across the continental United States, but we mainly provide services for areas east of the Mississippi. 
Our overall compensation is competitive with the industry, with a performance-based bonus structure. We offer benefits such as medical, dental, and vision insurance. We will soon be offering 401k packages, with a company match. Training is also included, providing the opportunity to keep your skills current.
