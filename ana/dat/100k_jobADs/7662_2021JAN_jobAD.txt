 David H. Gorski, M.D., Ph.D., F.A.C.S.  is an  academic (   i.e.: egg-head  ,  paper-pusher  ,  apparatchik  )**  surgical oncologist   specializing  in  breast surgery  and oncologic surgery 
 Gorski  is no  H.G. Wells 
 Wells   could  , at least,  tell a convincing lie  ; as he did in  War of the Worlds 
 Gorski 'd  likely  #fail  as his evil half-brother,  " H.G. **#Fails " **, in  World War Peed  , and probably didn't think his readers would get the  double-entendre ' 
 Gorski  is  more  famouser  for  pie in the sky 
 He'll never be likened to  Samuel Langhorne Clemens  , or receive a  " Mark Twain Award" 
 He's an  unlicensed **Hackademic Quackademic ** who believes that bad press is good press, any press is good press 
 Gorski  is the  " Guy"  who felt he was  Scroogled  by  Google  , when he and his public relations (P.R.) team; which reside in the ‎  hyperthalamus  section of his brain, decided on  12/5/2012  to go  pure  pseudononsense pseudononscience  : 
 Critiquing: Stanislaw Burzynski: On the arrogance of ignorance about cancer and targeted therapies [1] 
 wherein he quoted 
 Dr Burzynski  : 
 " I published the review article in a peer-reviewed journal almost 20 years ago on the principles of personalized gene-targeted therapy" 
 
 ====================================== 
 Gorski  : 
 "Curious as to just what the heck  Burzynski  was talking about here, I searched PubMed for this alleged review article" 
 "I couldn’t find it on PubMed" 
 "His only publications from the 1990s had nothing to do with cancer as a  “genetic disease”  or  “personalized gene-targeted cancer therapy”  and everything to do with  antineoplastons  " 
 "Perhaps  Burzynski  proposed this  “revolutionary” 
new idea in a peer-reviewed article that’s not indexed in PubMed, but if he did  I couldn’t find it using  Google  and Google Scholar" 
 "I was in graduate school 20 years ago, and was taught back then that cancer was primarily a genetic disease.. " 
 “There’s a term called  “oncogene,”  ** which describes genes that, when either mutated or too much is made, can result in cancer"_ 
 ====================================== 
 
 
 
 
 ====================================== 
 Gorski  would have the reader suspend belief, and believe that he's  not   smarter than a fifth-grader  ; which is entirely plausible 
 That he could not do a  search  on the  words  : 
 antineoplastons 
oncogenes 
Burzynski 
 and find anything whatsoever 
 ====================================== 
 
 ====================================== 
and that he did not have the cranial capacity to access the  Burzynski Clinic  web-site's  Scientific Publications  page: 
 ====================================== 
 
 ====================================== 
The  United States Food and Drug Administration   (FDA)  did  NOT  have any problem finding it

This, from a  doctor  , eager to prove to the world, just how smart he is, because of:

 ====================================== 
 
 ====================================== 
The same  " Guy"  who  claimed  : 
 Burzynski   never explains which genes are targeted by  antineoplastons 
 ====================================== 
 
 ====================================== 
A statement which I showed to be incorrect, by pointing out at least  18  different  Burzynski   scientific publications  which did what  Gorski  claimed they did  NOT [11-12] 
 ====================================== 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ====================================== 
When  Dr. David H. Gorski  said: 
 “Personally having  pored over  Burzynski’s publications” -  11/2/2012 
 “I’ve  read  many of Burzynski’s papers” -  2/18/2013 
 “I’ve  searched  Burzynski’s publications” -  5/8/2013 
 exactly what did he mean by  " pored over," "read,"  and  " searched"   ? 
 Some  Bill Clintonesque  definition designed to try and stump anyone who's not  smarter than a fifth-grader ? 
 (   " It depends upon what the meaning of the word 'is,' is"   ) 
 You don't have to be  smarter than a fifth-grader  to understand that  if   Dr. Gorski  actually  did what he said he did  , that  he should have been able to conclude  without any hint of doubt,  that   Burzynski   explains which genes are targeted by antineoplastons 
 Where was your head  ? 
 Was your head in  Mississippi   ? 
 Was your head like a hole  ? 
 Or was your head so far up your  " Show Me State"  pal  Robert J.   (  don't call me  " Bobby"   )   Bob  (  I 'm not a doctor ,  I just pretend like I 'm one  on the otherburzynskipatientgroup  (  TOBPG  )  and houstoncancerquack  )  blatherskite  Blatherskitewicz   (known liar) Blaskiewicz 's_ AstroTurf campaign , that you couldn't see what you were not doing  ? 
 This is a  guy   who has been funded by  : 
 a) the  Department of Defense   (DOD) 
 b) the  NIH (   National Institutes of Health   ) 
 c) the  Conquer Cancer Foundation  of  ASCO 
 and 
 d) the  Robert Wood Johnson Foundation 
 and  this  is the kind of supposed  " Science-Based Medicine"   (SBM)   " results"  he produces  ? 
 This  guy  is proclaimed as: 
 " a prolific essayist and managing editor of Science-Based Medicine, a  highly-respected blog  that exposes non-scientific research and practices" 
 A  " highly-respected blog"   ? 
 really  ? 
 Really  ?? 
 REALLY  ??? 
 You've gotta be kiddin' me  !!! 
 " For the last ten years, he has been a major voice — as himself and  pseudonymously  — for science-based medicine" 
 You mean that  " Orac"   Hack ? 
 " Dr Gorski also runs an active research laboratory at the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute" 
 Research ? 
 Is it similar to his  " research"  which I exposed here  ? 
 And yet, after showcasing such  " brillia  not  " research skilz ,  Tuesday  ,  7/30/2013  ,  Dr. Gorski  was appointed / named program co-director of  Michigan Breast Oncology Quality Initiative   (   MiBOQI   )  ; a state-wide initiative to improve the quality of  breast cancer care  using  evidence-based guidelines   [13] 
 He  " will be involved in many aspects of the quality initiative" 
 Let's hope that one of those aspects is  NOT  the  " research"  one 
 "  Dr. Gorski has the breadth and depth of knowledge  to effectively lead our very strong Breast Multidisciplinary Team,"  said Dr. Bepler 
 " I have every confidence that Dr. Gorski will continue this very high standard of care." 
 Perhaps  Dr. Bepler  is  out-of-touch with reality  when it comes to  Gorski 's **" research" ** and  " standard of care"  abilities 
 I wonder how long it is before his effort at infiltrating  evidence-based guidelines  with his  Science-Based Medicine  , raises its ugly hypocritical head  ? 
 During the  Holidays  , maybe  Dr. Gorski  will have time to celebrate his promotion with his wife with an evening out, and before he pops the surprise to her about his retirement plans for  Castro 's Cuba , he can take her by the hands, stare into her eyes with his big brown eyes; they have to be brown, right (  ?  ), because he's so full of "it," (  ?  ) and tell her these heart-warming words: 
 Darling, I know, that you know, that what I do brings home the bacon, and so it makes a difference in Michigan 
 In fact, I wanted to let you know how much of a difference I'm helping to make 
 1997 thru 2001, African American women breast cancer death rates per 100,000 in Michigan; as reported in the American Cancer Society Cancer Facts & Figures for African Americans, 2005-2006, listed Michigan as the state tied with the 20 most breast cancer cases per 100,000, with 36.2 
 I'm proud to announce that for the last 2 reporting periods (2011-2014), covering 2003 thru 2009, Michigan is no longer tied with the state with the 20 most cases of breast cancer per 100,000 
 Michigan   is now the state with the 11th most cases of breast cancer in African American women  , which rose .5 from 33.8 to 34.3 over the last 2 reporting periods 
 And that's not all 
 African American women   breast cancer incidences in   Michigan  , per 100,000,  rose  from 119.0, 2000 thru 2004 as reported in the 2007-2008 report, up .4 to 119.4, 2006 thru 2010, as reported 2013-2014 
 Additionally,  African American women   breast cancer death rates in   Michigan  , per 100,000,  rose  from 33.8 for 2003 thru 2007, as reported for 2011-2012, up .5 to 34.3 for 2006 thru 2010, reported 2013-2014 
 And furthermore, breast cancer incidences in Michigan, per 100,000, were 119.4 for African American women for 2006 thru 2010, reported 2013-2014, and 118.7 for 2006 thru 2010 for white women, reported 2013-2014 
 So  African American women   had .7 more breast cancer incidences than   white women 
 And also, the  breast cancer death rates in   Michigan  , per 100,000,  was 34.3 for   African American women  2006 thru 2010, reported 2013-2014,  11.5 more than the 22.8  for  white women  for 2006 thru 2010, as reported 2013-2014 
 And I thought you'd be very pleased to know that  the estimated new breast cancer cases in women in   Michigan  ,  rose from 6,120  in 2008,  to 8,140 in 2013 
 An increase of 2,010 
 And,  Michigan   went from being the state with the 9th most cases of estimated new breast cancer cases  ,  to the 8th 
 And as if that were not enough great news for you,  the estimated breast cancer deaths in women in   Michigan  ,  rose from 1,350  in 2004,  to an additional 10 more women  ,  1,360 in 2013 
 And just like with the estimated new women breast cancer cases, again,  Michigan   went from being the state with the 9th most cases of estimated breast cancer deaths  ,  to the 8th 
 And last, but certainly not least, Michigan cancer death rates dropped from 25.8 in 2008, 1.8 to 24.0 in 2013 
 However,  Michigan   went from being the state tied with the 18th most cancer cases  per 100,000,  to the state tied with the 11th most 
 But don't worry honey 
 If you're white like me, because you're in Michigan, the breast cancer incidence for you per 100,000, went from 133.9 for 1998 thru 2002, as reported 2005-2006, down 15.2 to 118.7 for 2006 thru 2010, as reported 2013-2014 
 And, even better, white death rates in Michigan per 100,000, dropped from 27.3 for 1996 thru 2000, as reported 2003-2004, 4.5 to 22.8 for 2006 thru 2010, as reported 2013-2014 
 And best of all, sweetie,  if you do get breast cancer and you 're white ,  you have a 9% better 5-year overall survival rate  (69% – whites /  60%  –  African Americans  , and for each stage of diagnosis for most cancer sites) 
 And I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that  life expectancy is lower for   African Americans  than whites  among women  (  77.2  vs. 80.9 years) (2013-2014) 
 If that's not job security for me, I don't know what is 
 The mistake that  Gorski  made is that he did not take into account that this is not the age of  Hitler  ,  Stalin  ,  Lenin  ,  Mussolini  , etc 
 In this day and age, people can  NOT  get away with adopting lying as a part of a strategy, because the  NSA  is watching, and so are  We  ,  the People 
 Remain calm 
 Germans subjugated themselves to Hitler, the Soviets, Stalin, Italians, Mussolini, Cubans to Castro, and  none  of them were worth subjugating oneself to 
 None of them  were worth being put on a pedestal 
 None of them  were greater than you or I 
 Gorski  is  NOT  the greater good 
 Gorski  has a degree in  " B.S."  from the  University of Michigan 
 I do  not  have a  " B.S."  degree 
 I'm the one  NOT full of   " B.S." 
 Now that sounds like a story ripe for a journalistic investigation 
 So, I guess that means  Bob Blaskiewicz 's  fave  " journalist,"  Liz Szabo, and  USA TODAY  , are out of the running for this type of  " reporting" 
 But look on the bright side: 
 " In his new role, he will work with  the Samuel Silver, M.D., Ph.D.  , who is the MiBOQI program director, as well as assistant dean for Research and professor of Internal Medicine/Hematology-Oncology at the University of Michigan Medical School" 
 Maybe  " the Samuel Silver, M.D., Ph.D."  will be  GorskGeeks   " checks and balances" 
 ====================================== 
 “Our only goal is to promote high standards of science in medicine” 
 ====================================== 
 http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/editorial-staff/ 
 
 ====================================== 
 Such risible hyperbole would induce fits of laughter in me if it weren 't such a complete lie 
 ====================================== 
I'm just glad dad got outta  Kellogg  country while he could 
 P.S.  : Per  Dr. David H. Gorski  , anything which might erroneously be perceived as a  lie  about  Burzynski  , is  NOT  anything wrong, per  Wayne State University   [14]

 Burzynski: "The Skeptics™" - Harming without Care

 or 
 " reckless disregard for the truth" 
—————————————————————— 
While some of  " The Skeptics™"  might be able to  run around  and  jump up and down  ,  proclaiming  that what they  smear  all over  social media  about  Burzynski  , they  had no knowledge of falsity  about, it is probably  harder  for someone who  claims  : 
 ====================================== 
 12/.5/2011  -  " positions I hold at an  NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center  " 
 ====================================== 
 
 ====================================== 
 3/7/2013  -  " my last two jobs have been at  NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers  " 
 ====================================== 
 
 ====================================== 
 11/2/2012 -  " Personally having pored over Burzynski's publications" 
 ====================================== 
 
 ====================================== 
 5/8/2013 -  " I've searched Burzynski's publications" 
 ====================================== 
 
 ====================================== 
 6/5/2013 -  “I do know cancer science” 
 ====================================== 
 
 ====================================== 
 6/7/2013 -  “Unlike Mr. Merola, I am indeed very concerned with getting my facts correct” 
 ====================================== 
 
I can just picture  Gorski  , in a  courtroom  , trying to  explain  to the  prosecuting attorney  ,  judge  , and  jury  , how it is that a  medical doctor  , with a  Ph.D.  , who has had  positions  at  2  National Cancer Institute (NCI) designated comprehensive cancer centers  , is the  co-author  on a  number of scientific publications  ,  blogs  on  2  blogs  , including one which  proclaims  : 
—————————————————————— 
 [7] –  “Our only goal is to promote high standards of science in medicine” 
—————————————————————— 
how it is that  his LIES  about  Burzynski  are  NOT  : 
 " reckless disregard for the truth"  ? [8] 
 Gorski  ,  you  of all  people  should be  extremely great-full  that  Burzynski  concentrates on  cancer science  instead of  libel lawsuits 
 I 'd pay to see that 🙂 
—————————————————————— 
 [9] - 3/6/2013  -  " Particularly seemingly damning are a series of Tweets flashed on the screen saying things like the Hope for Laura fund (the fund set up by Laura Hymas to pay for her treatment at the Burzynski Clinic)" 
 “appears to be just a money laundry for a lying quack fraud” and “when Laura dies #Burzynski will just move on to his next mark if she doesn’t run out of money first.” " 
 
 " I think I know whose Tweets these were. In fact, I’m sure I know whose Tweets these were, and all I can say to that person is this:" 
 " Zip it" 
 " Stop it" 
 " Put a sock in it" 
 " Still, as utterly insensitive and “dickish” as those Tweets were, they do not represent the majority of skeptics, but rather a  few jerks  " 
 " However, we as skeptics need to remember that a  few jerks  perceived (or painted) as attacking cancer patients can do immeasurable damage to the cause of science-based medicine" 
 " So if you’re one of those skeptics making comments like that,  knock it off  " 
 " If I see you doing it again, next time I will call you out publicly" 
 
 
 MURDER ? . 
 
 Gorski  , were you referring to the  above 2 JERKS?

 " But he is a, the thing is, the thing is, you thing you have to understand is Gorski,  Gorski is a genuine expert  , in matters re re regarding on oncology studies" 
 " I mean, he has a" 
 " He, He’s able to convince people, he’s able to convince people, on the strength of his record, to give him money to carry out research" 
 " People who know what they’re talking about" 
 " To give him money to carry out his research" 
 " Right ?"

 Are we talking about the same  " expert"  ? 
 Because I 'm talking about the LIAR

All  comments  by  Professor Robert J. (Bob) Blaskiewicz  of  University of Wisconsin, Eau Claire  "fame"  should be considered as likely  LIES  until such time as he keeps his word to respond on  this blog  , to  criticism  of him on  this blog 
—————————————————————— 
 " I hope somebody is writing all this down out there, so that we can go back and look at these claims later, right ?" 
—————————————————————— 
1:19:00 
—————————————————————— 
**Seriously, Bob ? 
 Do you really think one of  " The Skeptics™"  was going to write all this down, when none of them showed that they had written down much of anything of much note about  Burzynski 2  when they attended the screenings ? 🙂** 
—————————————————————— 
* Some words may or may not be missing, but it doesn 't take away from the final result 
I will be adding separate critiques that break this down into manageable parts, but wanted to have entire video comments altogether here 
—————————————————————— 
(0:04:38) 
—————————————————————— 
 Are you there ? 
—————————————————————— 
Yes 
—————————————————————— 
 Okay, we might as well get started if were going to do this 
—————————————————————— 
Okay 
—————————————————————— 
(0:05:00) 
—————————————————————— 
_Alright, so ummm I guess we can start with uhhh bit of a conversation  [0] 
 Uhhh 
 You've been on the Burzynski Hashtag for a long time - what's you're motivation ?_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well as I put in my about page, I agreed with the juror that he was neither guilty or innocent  [8] 
 So, so since I see all this opposition by these Skeptics, and I see that the they're getting all of their facts straight 
 (Freudian sarcasm slip) 
 I decided to take the position of being a Skeptic Skeptic 
 In other words I am skeptical of Skeptics who do not fact-check their information before they post it on social media 
—————————————————————— 
 Okay 
—————————————————————— 
And since I see ahhh y'all pretty much trying to take over the net with y'all's information I decided to come back and correct all the false information that was being put out by other Skeptics 
—————————————————————— 
 So what information have Skeptics posted that they uhhh that they missed that demonstrates that Burzynski 's uhhh treatments are effective ? 
—————————————————————— 
(0:06:00) 
—————————————————————— 
 What, what have we missed ? 
—————————————————————— 
Well the major issue is that the FDA's own information says if phase 3 trials are approved - phase 2 trials is to see if there's evidence of effectiveness 
 And so if phase 3 trials are approved, that means you've provided evidence of effectiveness 
 That's the FDA's own information - I have that clearly on my blog  [9] 
 Also the FDA has given Burzynski uhhh Orphan Drug Designation in 2004 for uhhh brainstem glioma and then in 2009 for all gliomas  [10] 
 So that must mean that there is evidence of effectiveness, otherwise I don't think they would be doing that 
 
 
0:07:00 
—————————————————————— 
_Well okay, uh one of the issues that Skeptics have with Burzynski is that in order to, let 's say, elevate uh the profile of his drug, in order to make sure that everybody who needs it can get, is to complete a phase 3 uh trial uh he started uh I believe was it just the one, right ? 
 Uhmmm, and that's gone nowhere 
 In fact, it was withdrawn this I think within the last week 
 It doesn't look like its going to happen, and this is, you know, for all the the phase 1 and phase 2 trials, those are very preliminary trials_ 
—————————————————————— 
(0:08:00) 
—————————————————————— 
 Uhmmm, the phase 3 is is will be the gold standard, and also the bare minimum that that the larger medical community will accept uhhh as evidence, so it 's like you've lowered the bar for for evidence in a way that that you know oncologists don't 
—————————————————————— 
Well the issue is he was given 2 phase 3 trials that we know of 
 One was on uh Clinical Trials . gov - the one about eye cancer 
—————————————————————— 
 The the 
—————————————————————— 
The vision cancer 
—————————————————————— 
 Right 
—————————————————————— 
And then the other one was not posted on there, but then again the FDA has said, and I posted this on my blog because I specifically contacted and asked them and they said we don't post all clinical trials on our web-site  [11] 
—————————————————————— 
 (Correction: NCI) 
—————————————————————— 
And so he obviously had that other one about brainstem glioma, that he was trying to get started  [12] 
 But the other issue is that Skeptics have posted on there that he could not get that accelerated approval until he had published a phase 2 trial and that is exactly not the case because other drugs have been given accelerated approval before their results were published in phase 2 clinical trial publications, cuz, so that question remains as well  [13] 
 
 
(0:09:00) 
—————————————————————— 
9:13 
—————————————————————— 
 So, do you think that there is a uh uh conspiracy to keep Burzynski from publishing ? 
—————————————————————— 
Well, what we do know is that in the movie, Merola showed that one page rejection from  The Lancet 
—————————————————————— 
 Right 
—————————————————————— 
where Burzynski was trying to show his results from like 8 to 16 years, and they said we think your uh publication would be seen best elsewhere, or some ridiculous statement like that 
 And so, I thought that funny of  The Lancet   [14] 
 
Of course, I understand their 2nd response, which came out, which Eric posted on his Facebook page, y'all, that y'all have talked about - that, you know, they're busy, they get a lot of 
submissions 
—————————————————————— 
(0:10:00) 
—————————————————————— 
I understand that, so obviously he would have to look for a different publication for both of those, things he's trying to get published 
—————————————————————— 
 Clarification: Burzynski and Tsuda 
—————————————————————— 
_Right 
 So, uhmmm, as far as I understand it  The Lancet  , uhhh the the question of  The Lancet  publication ehhh is par for the course, that most people are, when they get a speedy rejection from a uh uh, uh journal, are actually uh grateful, because that means there allowed to go ahead and submit their material to another journal more quickly and get it out there 
 Uhm, but the reaction that we saw on the side of the Burzynski camp was that, see, they'll never publish us_ 
—————————————————————— 
(0:11:00) 
—————————————————————— 
_Uhm, which is, eg, taken as far as I can tell as evidence of a conspiracy or that his name is is poison uh I mean, I think it is, but uhmmm, that wasn 't indicated in the in the rejection letter in order to uh claim that it is is to go beyond the evidence which again we're not really willing to do 
 So, uhmmm what is the the ration the the something that I think a lot of of a lot of  The Skeptics  have been curious about when it comes to your your your blog and your behavior on-line uhhh is that that that, that the format of your blog does not make sense to us, we don't understand exactly what you're trying to do with it 
 Could you kind of clarify that for us because it's uhhh long and it's it's intense and there's a lot of emotion behind it but we don't understand exactly, what it's supposed to mean_ 
—————————————————————— 
(0:12:00) 
—————————————————————— 
Well a lot of the time I'm making fun of y'all's favorite oncologist, the way he words his blogs, and uhmmm I cite specifically from the FDA, from from the National Cancer Institute, from these other scientific sources, from scientific publications 
 I give people specific information so they can fact-check me, unlike a lot of The Skeptics who just go out there and say things and publish things on social media, they provide no back-up for their uhhh sayings 
 And so when I critique an oncologist or any other Skeptic I always provide source material so people can always fact-check me and I specifically said that people should fact-check everything ummm that the oncologist should say because he has, I've proven him to be frequently incorrect about his information and misleading 
—————————————————————— 
(0:13:00) 
—————————————————————— 
And so I've tried to add those things and allow people to search, on specific things like publications, or what I posted about  The Lancet  , or specifically about  The Skeptics  , or specifically about the oncologist 
 So whenever I see something posted new on Twitter, by y'all, sometimes I'll check it out and sometimes I won't, and sometimes I'll comment on it 
—————————————————————— 
 Alright, ah have you read The Other Burzynski Patient Group ? 
—————————————————————— 
I was, on there just yesterday to see some more of your post on there  [15] 
—————————————————————— 
 So, ahmmm what is your response say to the story of Amelia Saunders ? 
—————————————————————— 
Well the thing is, when you accepted this hangout, I published my newest blog article and I specifically listed all the information I had critiqued from you previously including Amelia, and I posted the specific Twitter responses by BurzynskiMovie; which is probably Eric, to your issues with Amelia, and he disagrees with what the oncologist posted, and so I pretty much let his Twitter responses stand to what the oncologist said  [2] 
—————————————————————— 
0:14:24 
—————————————————————— 
 Okay, what part of, what did I get wrong ? 
—————————————————————— 
Well I also did a critique of the newspaper story that was put out about Amelia in the U.K.  [16] 
 And they had 2, 2 patients that were dealt with 
 And 
—————————————————————— 
 Uh was that Amelia and Luna ? 
—————————————————————— 
I believe, yes 
—————————————————————— 
 Luna was the other one, correct   [17] 
—————————————————————— 
And one of the patients, Burzynski has specifically published in one of his scientific publications that maximum dosage is not reached for a month 
—————————————————————— 
0:15:00 
—————————————————————— 
So if someone, so if someone only goes in there and has treatment for a month, they're not even, you know, they're finally going to reach the uh maximum dosage  [18] 
 
_And I think that was maybe the case with Luna, I think she was only there for a month 
 Oh, I, you're talking, oh this is one of the very 1st ones that we did on the, on the site 
 Uhmmm, oh, her name is, her name escapes me at the moment 
 Um, but she wasn't there for for very long but uh her condition deteriorated very rapidly 
 Uhmmm, and one of the questions that we had, we raised, is is, you know, you you don't need to reach full dosage 'cause the the full dosage for these ANP seem to be pretty high, at least the sodium load that that that patients are asked to to carry, or required to carry if they they go on it 
 And we wondered if the sodium load was ah to great for someone who has a brain tumor, I mean uh, you know uh sodium load will increase your blood pressure, and these people have extra things in their brains that probably won't react well to swelling, right, and and wont react well to pressure, so we were wondering, if in fact you don't have to reach the full dosage in order to have uh severe side effects_ 
—————————————————————— 
(0:16:00) 
—————————————————————— 
_Ummm, you know maybe you haven 't reached a therapeutic dose level, but that doesn't mean that it didn't have an effect on her 
 And you can clearly tell, that, you know in the videos, well at least the videos before the family took it down, that she was lethargic and a little bit out of it, she uh the the difference in her conscious state was no noticeable for anyone to see 
 Ummm, to, you know where she had been up and about to in her bed kind of slurring and and, and and and, in fact just disoriented, just looked like someone had taken the piss out of her_ 
—————————————————————— 
0:17:00 
—————————————————————— 
_I mean, ummm, so that 's, that one, ummm, you know the critique that, reaching therapeutic levels and having a biological effect on someone are are clearly different things in her case 
 Uhmmm, now I never went on you know on to say ummm that uh she had uh reached therapeutic levels 
 Uhmmm, I I think as far as I went was that she went, she paid her $30,000 dollars and then she died 
 Uhmmm, and and and what part of that's not true_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well my only thing is, uh, we know that sometimes he will go to a maximum dosage, or you know, the suggested dosage, but he will back down off it, in fact in the uh adverse effects you mentioned those are specifically adverse effects mentioned in his publications, and when that happens normally they will subside within 24 to 48 hours is what it says once you take them off the treatment and let, you know, those conditions take care of themselves, and then you will slowly raise the medication again  [19] 
 
0:18:33 
—————————————————————— 
So, you know, it just didn't tell, if only one month of treatment was enough to even start to do anything for her  [20] 
—————————————————————— 
 Okay, so, um, going back to Amelia, um, some of the the most um I think the most serious charges is that we see a uh repeatedly in his uh uh stories of his patients, um those are all cited, those are all backed uh by, you know, um at least as good as anything the Burzynski Patient Group has ever done 
—————————————————————— 
0:19:11 
—————————————————————— 
_Uhmmm, something that we see over and over are patients reporting over and over that signs of getting worse are signs if getting better 
 Um, in particular a, uh report that's very common from from patients is that the center of their solid tumors are breaking up 
 One of the problems that we we we see is that that is more frequently a sign of ischemic necrosis that the tumor has outgrown its blood supply and that it's dying on the inside 
 And when you see something like a 5th of the patients who we've been able to to document, reporting this excitedly, we get extremely concerned about what's happening_ 
—————————————————————— 
0:20:02 
—————————————————————— 
 Uhmmm, what part of that is not absolutely terrifying to you 
—————————————————————— 
Well the thing is, the FDA has approved phase 3 <strong[12]**and also given them the Orphan Drug Designation, which means they should have some knowledge about what's going on, I would think  [10] 
 Plus we don't know for sure, we've heard about, ummm, some of the things supposedly the oncologist has talked about, which is cutting off the blood flow, to the tumor, which is something that some uhhh drugs can do, and I think that's one of the things Burzynski has tried to do, ah he's specifically mentioned it in his personalized treatment 
 But I don’t know for sure if it’s also something that’s done with the ANP’s in just the clinical trials environment 
—————————————————————— 
0:20:02 
—————————————————————— 
So, that could be a possibility 
—————————————————————— 
_Well, the the yeah I 've never seen anyone say that the purpose of the antineoplastons is to cause uhhh, you know, to restrict the blood flow to the tumor and and and uh cause it to die that way, which is certainly one therapeutic approach that's been, that's been floated and research has been done on uh and might even be promising and uh what he's saying is that cancer is caused by a lack of antineoplastons in the system and that basically what he is doing is antineoplaston uh uh supplement therapy uh rath, what's the word I'm looking for, uhm uh, replacement therapy 
 Uh and there isn't a doctor on the planet, uh not a medical specialist on the planet, who, I, who has identified at at as a contributing factor as a contributor to cancer or antineo or lack of antineoplastons 
 So_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well 
—————————————————————— 
 Why isn 't he, you know, you understand that these doctors, ummm like nothing is true or false because a doctor says it is true or false 
—————————————————————— 
0:22:26 
—————————————————————— 
_Uhmmm it 's it's it but when the entire medical community uhhh who are des are desperately are are every bit as tired of seeing patients die uhmmm and seeing patients suffer or as anyone else's families are you you imagine what an oncologist sees in that office over the course of of a year and there's going to be unimaginable suffering 
 I'm sure that they're tired of that 
 And that they would, you know, that if there was the slightest hint that antineoplaston deficiency was a cause of cancer that it would make it into the literature, with or without Burzynski_ 
—————————————————————— 
0:23:10 
—————————————————————— 
 Uhhh ummm, why should we trust him when he has uh the sole uh the only person who had identified antineoplastons as a contributor to cancer when he is the sole manufacturer of the of the therapy uh when he is the uh sole prescriber of the therapy and when he is, where the sole distributor of the therapy from his pharmacy 
—————————————————————— 
Well what I find interesting about these other doctors is like like the doctors mentioned in the movie and BBC Panorama's report and in some of these newspaper articles where they are mentioned again is that these doctors never do a review of Burzynski's scientific publications and including our favorite oncologist who refuses to do so  [20] 
 Uhhh  [21] 
—————————————————————— 
0:24:10 
—————————————————————— 
_He 's read everything 
 I think_ 
—————————————————————— 
 
 
Oh yeah he says he's read everything but uh you know he claims that he's uhmmm reviewed, reviewed uh Burzynski's personalized gene targeted therapy but he, but then just a few months ago he admitted, you know, I don't know where Burzynski says which genes are targeted by antineoplastons  [22] 
 
And I pointed out which specific publications that Burzynski published, publications which specifically mention which genes are targeted by antineoplastons, and I said how can you claim that you've read and reviewed every Burzynski publication and you didn't know which genes are targeted by antineoplastons when that's specifically in the publications ?  [10] 
 To me that tells me that you do not know how antineoplastons work be because you just admitted you don't know which genes Burzynski talks about 
 I mean that's just funny as heck to me that he would say that 
—————————————————————— 
0:25:07 
—————————————————————— 
_Can you go ahead and send me that link that that I saw in the chat that you had uh posted a couple of times in the chat 
 Could you send me that link, to that publication 
 I can give you a minute to to go find it if that's_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well I've, I've got it on my blog 
 Uhm 
 I mean I can forward it to you at some point 
—————————————————————— 
_That would be good 
 Uhmmm_ 
—————————————————————— 
But I agree with you about I don't remember seeing anything about antineoplastons cutting off the blood flow to the, you know the blood brain barrier for sure either 
—————————————————————— 
_Well, yeah that 's a, that's you know one of the major problems that this this cancer has is the location is such a pain to get to 
 Uhm, and often when we are talking about these cancers, the thing that gets me over and over and over, and this is something that I've learned from from working uh with others on the Burzynski Patient Group is what's it like to be a cancer patient, only by proxy, man I couldn't imagine really going through this myself, and, you know I'd hate to see my family go through this_ 
—————————————————————— 
0:26:22 
—————————————————————— 
_That these people are at what could be described as a low point, they 're um uhhh, you get a diagnosis of uh brainstem glioma the prognosis is very bad 
 Uhmmm, there are only a few cases of people recovering from that, I mean they're there uhm uhhh but, you know that it's an, it's an extremely grim prognosis 
 Uhhh and I worry that when they're in that desperate state and especially let's talk about the children, you have these kids who are uh you know 2 and 3 and have had this, you know uh awful diagnosis and the parents are willing to do literally anything to keep their kids alive_ 
—————————————————————— 
27:16 
—————————————————————— 
 What protections are in place for patients as far as that these kids are and and their parents are protected 
—————————————————————— 
0:27:30 
—————————————————————— 
Well I think i know the point that you're getting at uhhh about the IRB's and all that good stuff 
 All I can say is that, you know the FDA can come in with any amount of investigators and say that you did this or that but you have the opportunity to respond, and so they can pretty much say anything, it's only when the final report comes out that you can take that to the bank 
 And so all this speculation about what a investigative team may say about the clinic is, to me just like someone going into a lawsuit and saying so-and-so did this, you know, can you prove that, you know, did so-and-so do that  [23] 
—————————————————————— 
0:28:09 
—————————————————————— 
So it's the same thing with the FDA, these um little reports, the final report is what counts, and so, also what I find interesting is some of Burzynski's publications specifically said, you know this particular uh clinical trial, the IRB was agreed upon by the FDA  [24] 
 Well if if the FDA agreed upon it, you know, then some questions should arise about exactly what did the FDA agree upon 
 What would we find out from a Freedom of Information Act request on that ? 
 And, and what I also found interesting is when I did research on other clinical trials for brainstem glioma I found, you know, all these other science based medicine studies where 374 children had died in their studies  [25] 
—————————————————————— 
0:29:00 
—————————————————————— 
And what I found interesting is back in 1999, they reported on a clinical trial, they had better results then all these clinical trials afterwards  [18] 
—————————————————————— 
 Who had the better results ? 
—————————————————————— 
Well, I would have to find you one, there were like 3 
—————————————————————— 
 Okay 
—————————————————————— 
There were like 3 major ones that Burzynski has mentioned in his publications to cross-reference his trials versus their trials as far as the results 
 And so, I, there was one back in 1999 that had better results than a lot of these clinical trials that come afterwards 
 So when we talk about, you know, what's really right for the patients well we can see that the drug companies want to test their drugs through clinical trials and, you know, and if your kid dies, well, unfortunately the kid dies 
 Even though we showed better results in 1999 with a different type of treatment, you would have thought that maybe they would have poured more investment into that particular treatment but that's not necessarily how the clinical trial system works 
—————————————————————— 
0:30:00 
—————————————————————— 
_Hmmm, yeah, the, Guy Chapman has just um uh tossed in a a, a comment 
 I guess uh that there are a lot of people who wanna talk to you (laughter) 
 Uh, Guy Chapman has just jumped in and said it looks like you forgot the phase 3 trial is withdrawn and none of the phase 2 trials were published 
 Uhmmm, this, this is not a minor thing for for for Skeptics 
 This, this is exactly what will convince us to get on board the Burzynski train is the publication of these trials 
 But even the preliminary trials, one has been finished, and none has been published in its entirety for over 15 years 
 When you consider that this is a, as you just pointed out, this is a a cancer, the, especially the brainstem gliomas 
 That these cancers uh the cases resolved fairly quickly, we know what the outcome are fairly quickly_ 
—————————————————————— 
0:31:00 
—————————————————————— 
 Ummm, do you have any sense of when these trials are going to be published ? 
—————————————————————— 
Well here's my point, I mean, y'all probably get a better sense from, ummm, Hymas, about what's going on with that 
—————————————————————— 
 From Laura ? 
—————————————————————— 
From her uh fiancé, or husband, whatever his status happens to be right now (laugh) 
—————————————————————— 
 Right 
—————————————————————— 
And uh also from Ric, uh they're more closer to Burzynski than I am, because I have never met Burzynski, I have never e-mailed Burzynski, uhmmm never talked to Burzynski, never met him, blah blah blah 
 Uh, my sense is that since 1996 when the FDA talked about antineoplastons, that specific FDA Commissioner that was in charge at the time, he set out 7 major points about how there was going to be less people required and there was going to be less paperwork, there was going to be less stringent things about Partial Response  [26] 
—————————————————————— 
0:32:07 
—————————————————————— 
And so, to me, the FDA is the final source to go to when people want to complain about how long their trials have lasted uh because the FDA is bottom line, you know, in charge of that 
 And 
—————————————————————— 
 When you, when you think about a major, sorry, go ahead 
—————————————————————— 
And my other point is that, uhmmm, when these trials finish, as I've pointed out on my blog, M.D. Anderson finished a trial in 2006 and didn't publish the results electronically until January of this year  [27] 
 So, just think 
 Burzynski's 1st trial we know that finished in 2009 
 So we would still have more years to go before he caught up to M.D. Anderson as far as publishing 
 So for him to actually be trying to publish stuff now and The Lancet not publishing because they have other stuff to do, put in there, that's understandable 
—————————————————————— 
0:33:03 
—————————————————————— 
So, we know that he's trying to publish, uh but they're going to keep it close to the vest obviously, from, from how they do their things, and where they're trying to publish 
 And plus, like I've said before 
—————————————————————— 
 Yeah, right, uh 
—————————————————————— 
We've still got the accelerated approval thing that's out there, you know, like the FDA's given Temodar and, and Avastin, and another drug, whereas they're not doing the same thing for antineoplastons, eve even though for all intents and purposes from what we know, antineoplastons have had better success rates than Temodar and Avastin when they were approved  [13] 
—————————————————————— 
 Antineoplastons has a better rate ? 
—————————————————————— 
Well from the information that's been published in certain um publications 
—————————————————————— 
 Right 
—————————————————————— 
And in, and in not only Burzynski's but elsewhere in, in newspapers or articles, or such like that 
—————————————————————— 
_Right, one of the things that that there there are 2 points to be made here 
 Uhm, the 1st one is that major pharmaceutical companies that are getting this accelerated approval have a track record of producing results which Burzynski does not have 
 Secondly, when it comes to ummm the rates of antineoplastons, how can we possibly say without a single published trial he, that he has an improved rate over Temodar or anything like that, and that's exactly what would show to us whether or not his rate is better, the the types of publications that he's done, that look really good on paper, ummm, to the to the, the common persons eye are these case series where he goes through and picks out people who have happened to have survived_ 
—————————————————————— 
0:34:47 
—————————————————————— 
_But what that doesn 't tell us is whether or not the antineoplaston had anything to do with it 
 What you need to do is go and separate the background noise, the random weird rare but very real survive, unexpected survivals that occur, and separate those, uhhh, from any effect of antineoplaston, he's never done that_ 
—————————————————————— 
0:35:10 
—————————————————————— 
Well what I found interesting is when the FDA approved these other 1 or 2 drugs, some of them specifically said that, uhhh, some of these drugs had, you know, better survivability or  they showed no better rate than any previous treatment  but we're approving it anyway  [13] 
 Basically that's what the publication said and I published this on my blog in an article specifically about, you know, those 2 or 3 drugs that the FDA approved for brainstem or brain related cancers  [28] 
 And so, you know, I'm not going to buy that argument about that, about that specific thing 
—————————————————————— 
 But if you think about that, I mean that if it does have a a an improvement rate above uh other treatments 
—————————————————————— 
0:36:03 
—————————————————————— 
_That still has an improvement rate, you know, that, that would give another option to people, ummm, even if in the aggregate their rates aren 't better 
 It might work on some individuals tumors rather than on, you know, you you it it is it taken as a, as a lump but extend life by uh quality of life for 3 months or something um in some cases but, you know, it it still has an effect, a real effect, and deserves to be out there _ 
—————————————————————— 
Well one of these newspaper articles specifically said, you know, Avastin would maybe keep you alive for maybe 4 more months 
 So, you know, take that  [2] 
—————————————————————— 
 That 's a long time when someone is dying 
—————————————————————— 
Well, we can wonder if some of Burzynski's results are the same, otherwise why would the FDA say, you know, give the ODD  [10]  , why would the FDA give the phase 3 approval  [12] 
—————————————————————— 
0:37:02 
—————————————————————— 
Plus I don't buy some of these doctors coming out and saying stuff, they have the opportunity just like the other doctors in Egypt  [29]  , in Russia  [30]  , in Germany, in, in Poland  [31]  , in China  [32 - 33] , in Taiwan  [34]  that have done antineoplaston studies, I'm like, these people can do antineoplaston studies so what's the excuse for all these other doctors who say that they supposedly can't do them 
 You know, the information's out there and 
—————————————————————— 
 Well, one of 
—————————————————————— 
and like these other doctors can do it 
—————————————————————— 
 One of the problems that that doctors have in in this country when it comes to doing ummm antineoplastons studies to verify any any effect that uh Burzynski has uhhh I i think back to the one where people say well that the FDA sabotaged his trials, and 
—————————————————————— 
Well, we kind of know that that's a fact  [35] 
—————————————————————— 
 Clarification: NIH  ,  NCI  , and the  Investigators 
—————————————————————— 
_Well, if if you think about it though, um, the, the proposed action as I understand it of the antineoplaston is that it 's a deacetylase inhibitor, which slightly unspools DNA, that allows uh, which would allow uh proteins to get into a pair of damaged DNA 
 And we have drugs that do that which carry a much lower sodium load 
 Uh, um, it, that would have a therapeutic effect on and that the risks outweigh the possible benefits of using this one particular drug 
 Um, I've seen any number of people looking at um, if you look at the Luna ah Pettiguine uh uh story on The Other Burzynski Patient Group um you see that the doctor is absolutely horrified by the insane sodium load that that Burzynski's patients are carrying 
 Um in in some ways that that sodium load is uh leading people to constantly drinking up to I've seen 12 liters of water a day_ 
—————————————————————— 
0:39:11 
—————————————————————— 
_That 's not necessary for other deacetylase inhibitors 
 Um the, why would you prefer that to to another drug if it did essentially the same thing, that didnt have this massive side effect ?_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well what we know from 1996 from Burzynski's own information that he's published, is that not only does he have the original parent antineoplastons, but he's developed 2nd and 3rd generations, but he can't just stop in the middle of his clinical trial and use the 2nd and 3rd generations which may be better  [36] 
 (Clarification: 1997) 
 He can't uh use these other types of um antineoplastons that other researchers, researchers like Egypt  [29]  , or Japan  [37]  have found um that may be better because he can't just switch in the middle of the clinical trial 
—————————————————————— 
0:40:04 
—————————————————————— 
Now if he, if the FDA approves his product, well then, maybe he can roll out the 2nd and 3rd generation and these other types of antineoplastons that may be less harsh, but that's all he's got to work on and that takes us back to the FDA, having control over the entire process, as far as the paperwork, how many people are in the trials, etcetera 
—————————————————————— 
 Well that sss I believe that that 's proposed by the researchers, the design trial, you know they they sign off on it but that is is, is up to uh Burzynski uh my uh David James @StortSkeptic on the   [38] 
—————————————————————— 
Right 
—————————————————————— 
 ah he has asked everything that Burzynski does looks sort of like the behaviors of pseudo-science 
—————————————————————— 
0:40:56 
—————————————————————— 
 So what we 're saying uhhh he does uh uhhh Burzynski like for instance like I said he has vertically integrated, ah, he controls all parts from identification to the creation of the drug uh to the diagnosing uh well he doesn't do the diagnosing but he does um um prescribe and distribute, he does all that vertically, which is actually something that snake oil salesmen do 
—————————————————————— 
0:41:32 
—————————————————————— 
_Another thing that that 's a red flag in Skeptic circles is that his one compound seems to be a sort of panacea for all sorts of different types of, of of cancers, um where we know that cancer has a a varied uh, uh, ideology and and the uh panaceas are are are to be and a variety of different types of causes um, in fact in any one tumor you would, you could say that these, these tumors are are completely uh heterogenous 
 The idea that there's gonna be one knockout, it seems rather unrealistic 
 Um, additionally he charges immense amounts of money for this drug, um, even though the components cost pennies 
 Um, on top of that, um, there's something that he asks for a a huge payment up front_ 
—————————————————————— 
0:42:33 
—————————————————————— 
_That 's something that's been warned against for generations of uh by anti-quack um uh crusaders if if they're asking for everything up front, then be afraid 
 Ummm, another thing is that uh the kind of cult that's sprung up around Burzynski, uh, one that is immune to uh criticism, reason, and pits people who are doing standard cancer research, as enemies, um, creating a black and white version of the world where there are good people and there are bad people_ 
—————————————————————— 
0:43:15 
—————————————————————— 
_There are people who are fighting the disease, and then there are people who are really helping the disease 
 I mean, if you look at the, the new web-site by the Burzynski patients fighting back group, they say support the cure not the cancer 
 That's a manikin world-view of black and white_ 
—————————————————————— 
0:43:30 
—————————————————————— 
_Um, these are all huge red flags, that you 're dealing with a quack 
 Um, why hasn't Burzynski done anything to change that ?_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well I find it interesting that you talk about the cost, because I've done a lot of research about the cost, and I was just looking at the cost again this morning, and put it into that particular blog article I was talking about, that I did for this particular program  [39] 
 And, um 
—————————————————————— 
0:44:00 
—————————————————————— 
The thing that's funny is that people can say, ohhh Burzynski charges a lot, but the fact is, so does chemo, radiation, and some of these newspaper articles that have been published, and specifically in the movie, Burzynski 2, one of the people mentioned how much someone was paying for standard treatment 
 And I noticed our 
—————————————————————— 
 Right 
—————————————————————— 
favorite oncologist didn't comment about that in his movie review  [40] 
—————————————————————— 
_Well, there, this is important 
 This is really important though 
 Wha, when she's talking about, that's Luna Pettiguine's mother, is is talking about the costs there 
 Uhmmm, you, when someone is not insured in in this country, 
 Ahm, the, the the base cost that that's calculated is, is the hospital only expects to get a fraction, a tiny fraction of that back from the insurance companies, and that's why the costs are so inflated 
 Um, usually, when a patient is self-pay there is a self-pay price which is a more reasonable price_ 
—————————————————————— 
0:45:01 
—————————————————————— 
_Additionally, all of those therapies, have demonstrated efficacy, and if Burzynski were to demonstrate his efficacy, $30,000 dollars to start on a life-saving treatment for a child would be a steal, and he would earn every nickel of it 
 Um, so, those arguments hold very little weight with us_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well what I find interesting, you know, I'm not sure how people think he's supposed to pay for the clinical trials, you know, if he's supposed to go into debt, millions of dollars 
—————————————————————— 
_He has a a an enormous house that 's valued in the tens of millions of dollars, he could do that if if the other, the other thing he could do, and this, we would love to see him do this, wousa, would be apply to Federal grant 
 That, that would be amazing, if he could get a grant to study this stuff 
 But, you know, um, I I don't think he'd be able to get one, I don't think he's shown uh that he can carry off a uh a research program responsibly_ 
—————————————————————— 
0:46:08 
—————————————————————— 
 Uhmmm 
—————————————————————— 
I find that funny considering the FDA approved phase 3, has given him ODD for brainstem glioma and also also all gliomas  [12] 
 You know, that's kind of ridiculous  [10] 
 And the people 
—————————————————————— 
 Well 
—————————————————————— 
gettin' off about his house, well who cares ? 
 They don't know where his money came for that particular source 
—————————————————————— 
 (Clarification:  " They don't know the particular source where his money came from for that house" ) 
—————————————————————— 
 Oh he, have you noticed the the, the thing on his web-site where if you make a donation to the clinic it goes directly to him ? 
—————————————————————— 
Well, you know, when you have good tax lawyers your tax lawyers will tell you how to structure things, and everybody in America has the right to structure their taxes in a manner that effectively serves them according to our Supreme Court 
 So, if you have a tax lawyer who tells you, hey this is the best way to do it, to save money, well, you may do that uh based upon your lawyer's advice 
—————————————————————— 
0:47:00 
—————————————————————— 
So, maybe Burzynski has taken his tax lawyers advice, just like I'm sure he's taken Richard Jaffe's ad advice (laugh), which has proved well, for him 
—————————————————————— 
 Right 
—————————————————————— 
You know, you know 
 That's another thing 
—————————————————————— 
_Ummm, o-kay 
 Uh, I want to turn this over to the people who are watching 
 Um, I want to give them a a chance to address you as well 
 Uhmmm, hi everyone 
 Uhmmm, so, um, let's, let's wait for for that to roll in, and I do wait to go back to the, the the, the and let's be very specific about this, the the things that you see on The Other Burzynski Patent Group, a patient reporting that um uh getting worse is getting better 
 How do you explain that ?_ 
—————————————————————— 
0:48:00 
—————————————————————— 
Well I guess we could ask, you know, Ben and Laura Hymas  [41] 
 What was their experience, you know ? 
 Did they have, did she have to drink uh a lot of water because she was thirsty ? 
 You know, did she have to drink a lot of water due to the high sodium ? 
—————————————————————— 
_Well that 's just a known side-effect, your going to know that going in, but we actually have people say _ 
—————————————————————— 
So I would ask her about her personal experience instead of saying, you know, instead of quoting some of these other people 
—————————————————————— 
_Are there, why why why not, these people, see this is the thing though 
 The reason that site was started was because the people that don't make it don't have a voice 
 And when you, when you whittle away, when you only look at the at the, the positive outcomes, which is exactly in Burzynski's favor to only look at the positive outcomes, and to have no sense of how other people's diseases progressed, right, you're gonna get a skewed and inaccurate version of the efficacy of this particular drug 
 Now lets lets  lets go back and not talk about Laura  , lets talk about these patients who report symptoms of getting worse, as if they were signs of getting better 
 Some people say that oh it's a healing crisis or it's progression of the disease 
 Or other people say it's breaking up in the middle, hurrah_ 
—————————————————————— 
0:49:20 
—————————————————————— 
_No, it 's actually a tumor that's growing 
 That record there, that's being left by patients, whose stories are every bit as important as the as the stories of the patients who have lived, are painting a completely different picture 
 How do you explain that ?_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well we all know the FDA is in charge of this, and so hopefully they know what's going on 
—————————————————————— 
_Are they feeding these people their stories ? 
 Are they feeding these people their stories_ 
—————————————————————— 
No, I'm sure the FDA can look at the records because Burzynski sent them 2.5 million pages according to our friend Fabio  [42] 
 
0:50:00 
—————————————————————— 
And uh, you know just something the doctors who came in and did the little ol' one day, 6 patient records, where they reviewed all the records and slides, and MRI's, etcetera, you know they can do the same thing, the FDA can do the same thing with all these patients  [35] 
 (Clarification: 7) 
 And see the same MRI's and scans, etcetera 
 I mean, we, we know that with all these 374 children I mentioned dying in other science-based medicine clinical trials  [25] 
 I mean, they, FDA probably went through all their records 
 And, so, all these people didn't look good either but, you know, the FDA still gave approval to Avastin and Te Temodar even though a lot of people died in their clinical trials  [25] 
—————————————————————— 
_Okay I 'm going to go back, I want to point something else out to you 
 Um, I have to, I don't remember the exact patient so I have to go back to my web-site to take a look at it 
 Um_ 
—————————————————————— 
0:51:00 
—————————————————————— 
_Because we are, because we 're on a Google+ stream that that's a lot of data it takes awhile to bring up my, my site 
 Let me 
 Uhmmm_ 
—————————————————————— 
I mean, we could agree that since Burzynski's publication says that it's going to take a month to get up to required dosage, and so we know, the tumor can still grow, like he said, up to 50%, he specifically acknowledges that in his publication, so, we know that can happen  [43] 
—————————————————————— 
0:51:35 
—————————————————————— 
_Well, that seems to give him an instant out, no matter what happens 
 That turns his claims into something that's unfalsifiable 
 If I could give you an example of what unfalsifiable is 
 Um, and I'll I'll draw an uh, uh, case, uh hypothetical case of um uh proposed by Carl Sagan as the invisible dragon in your garage_ 
—————————————————————— 
0:52:00 
—————————————————————— 
_If you say you have have a dragon in your garage, um, you know, you should be able to go over and verify that there 's a dragon in the garage 
 So let's say we go over to Carl Sagan's garage and, you know 
 Well, I don't see anything 
 Well it's an invisible dragon 
 Well okay, well then, let's uh spray paint it 
 Well, it's incorporeal 
 Well, uh, let's measure for the heat of the breath 
 Well it's heatless flame that it breathes 
 And, you know, okay, well then we'll put flour down on the ground to see that it's it it's standing there 
 And, oh no it's ah it's floating 
 Well, you know, at some point, when you can't falsify something 
 When you cannot, even in principle, prove something false, it's indistinguishable from something that's not there 
 And that kind of out, that oh well the tumor can keep on growing 
 Th (laugh) that that that's an invisible dragon, as far as I can tell_ 
—————————————————————— 
0:53:00 
—————————————————————— 
Well we know from his own publications, he says he can't just go in and start giving the maximum dose, or recommended dose right off the bat because a particular condition will occur, and he specifically mentions, in the publications what that condition is, I don't remember it right off the top of my head  [20] 
 But then again, his 2nd generation, his 3rd generation, his other form of antineoplastons that may work in the future, if approved, well those could possibly  (not)  have the same uh adverse effects that the current parent generation have  [36] 
 But we don't know, and like I said the FDA I'm sure knows because they have all the records, we don't have them, and so unlike our favorite oncologist I'm not going to speculate, about what the FDA knows and I do not know 
—————————————————————— 
 A every time that I and and and and , and David points this out, that um, you you know your not going to speculate about the the FDA but then at every turn your invoking the FDA as being obstructionist 
—————————————————————— 
0:54:02 
—————————————————————— 
_I, I just find that to be contradictory and and self-defeating 
 Um, let me see_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well we know they stopped this particular trial, supposedly because a patient died 
 So what's the hold-up ? 
 I mean, hopefully they've done an autopsy 
 What was found 
—————————————————————— 
 Well, that 's not necessarily true 
—————————————————————— 
No 
—————————————————————— 
_I mean uh when it when it comes to the case um I 've i've talked to oncologists about this 
 And when it comes to uh for instance in in this case it sounds like it was a pediatric patient who was dying, ummm, who had died, ummm, the, 
the 1st inclination is to ascribe the death to, um, to the tumor, which actually, would be to Burzynski's benefit if there were other cases, I'm not saying there were, but if there were other cases where this type of complication arose, and it was ascribed to the tumor they might well not do it, uh, do an autopsy_ 
—————————————————————— 
0:55:08 
—————————————————————— 
_Um, it 's ah as you could imagine it could be very difficult for the families to do that especially when they have ooh ah, a possibility of what, you know, led to the ultimate demise, that didn't involve them ultimately somehow being responsible for it, right? 
 So, it it it doesn't seem to me that necessarily an autopsy would be um a a done deal 
 Um, let me see_ 
—————————————————————— 
And we don't have a final report from the FDA on what the findings were 
—————————————————————— 
 No we don 't and it would be irresponsible to completely speculate on on, on, the outcome of that uh, uh, uh, individual patient, I am still scrolling through looking for this story that I wanted to talk about 
—————————————————————— 
0:56:00 
—————————————————————— 
_Uh, and, I guess I 'll 
 It should be in Amelia's I I, I packed Amelia's story with all the stories, um, that I could find um in what we'd written up already 
 Um 
 Hold on a sec 
 She is a cute kid though 
 Um, alright 
 Now, our favorite oncologist (laugh), as you keep putting it, um, uh, with with the Amelia story, um, uh, was able to correctly determine that the Saunders family, had a, did not understand the significance of this cyst that had opened up in, uh, that had opened up in the center of the tumor, in fact they were ecstatic 
 They were delighted 
 Um, the family, of Haley, um, S, also_ 
—————————————————————— 
0:57:10 
—————————————————————— 
_Uh, the the family of Haley S., also, had the same reading given to them 
 Um, the same diagnosis uh same prognosis was to, was given to Justin B in 2006 
 A similar cyst in Lesley S's story uh ah, was in 2006 
 Um, and that kept her on uh treatment for a a another month so that could be another $7,000 some odd dollars 
 We same thing in the, in the case of, uh, Samantha T in 2005 
 We see it again as far back as 1994, in Cody G's story 
 And then lastly and and the worst uh thing that we've seen, the patients report that Burzynski himself told Chase uh Sammut_ 
—————————————————————— 
0:58:00 
—————————————————————— 
_The exact same thing 
 Um, and that was a 
 Have you read Chase's story_ 
—————————————————————— 
I don't remember specifically 
 Possibly not 
—————————————————————— 
_It would stick with you, because that case is grotesque 
 The parents, uh, there was even a uh, uh, a fight over whether or not the parents should be allowed to continue treating this kid 
 He was basically lying, uh, in a uh uh brain dead uh for all intents and purposes, uh, in a in a coma uh without possibility of reversal, in his parents living room for months 
 Um, eh, all the while, he's still on the, uh, we'll I don't actually, I can't say that, I don't exactly know if he was on the treatment the whole time 
 Um, but, we do have this pattern, that is there, of people believing, that this particular pattern is, uh, progress, a a is not progression of disease but is is inducement to to stay on, um, eh, and this has been going on for decades 
 Eh, eh just based on what we've been able to find that patients have been reporting this for decades_ 
—————————————————————— 
0:59:20 
—————————————————————— 
_At some point, you would think that a doctor would realize that perhaps what these patients are walking away with is inaccurate 
 Why hasn't that changed ?_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well he's using the same 1st generation drug 
—————————————————————— 
_E wel that that that that 's not it 
 This is this is like the 2nd day of oncology class, that that's what the tumor looks like 
 People are reporting that the tumor is no longer growing, um, or that the growing has slowed after they've started 
 Well, okay 
 There, there is an explanation for that, and why you can't take that as necessarily being evidence of efficacy_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:00:00 
—————————————————————— 
_Ah, the tumor grows exponentially while the resources are available to it, but then it reaches a point where it 's a self-limited growth, so it, the time between uh doublings in size decreases logarithmically 
 Um, so this is, this is like basic tumor physiology that we're talking about, and his patients don't leave his office, knowing these facts, for decades 
 This doesn't have anything to do with the, do with the drug 
 This this_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well I'm sure a lot of people leave the doctors office not knowing things (laugh), for decades 
—————————————————————— 
_But, but when it 's, this treatment is working or this is not evidence that the treatment is working 
 That's pretty basic 
 I mean we're not, we're not talking about deacetylase inhibitors or anything like that were you'd really need to know something about 
 This is, whether or not, you're getting the outcome that you want_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:01:00 
—————————————————————— 
_This is the whole reason for going 
 And it has nothing to do with the with the with the drugs_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well we know the contin, the tumors can uh continue to grow for awhile, at least, and certain effects that they probably would 
—————————————————————— 
 Which is, which is like which we just pointed out was a was an invisible dragon 
—————————————————————— 
Well I'm sure, I mean, it's going to continue to grow, in any other clinical trial too, for a certain awhile 
 I mean like 
—————————————————————— 
_you 're you're you're assuming 
 You're you're you're assuming that 
 You're assuming that 
 Um, I'm not assuming that_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well we know that all these other kids died in these science-based medicine trials, and, you know, we can assume that that was the case there too  [25] 
—————————————————————— 
1:02:00 
—————————————————————— 
_Ultimately it would, but whether or not it it it had a genuine therapeutic effect is a different matter all together 
 Um, this, what would, what would convince you that you're wrong_ 
—————————————————————— 
The FDA not giving him phase 3 approval  [12]  , the FDA not giving him ODD designation  [10] 
—————————————————————— 
 So you 're saying because the Orphan Drug Designation and the face that there's a phase 3, therefor it works ? 
—————————————————————— 
And showing that, and showing the FDA that there's evidence of effectiveness  [11] 
—————————————————————— 
 So what you 're saying is there's nothing that would convince you now, that it doesn't work 
—————————————————————— 
Not until the FDA says it doesn't work 
—————————————————————— 
_O-kay 
 Um, it's it's it's not the FDA's, but you understand it's not the FDA's job to tell someone that their drug doesn't work_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well they seem to be doing a good job of it 
—————————————————————— 
1:03:00 
—————————————————————— 
_it 's it's it's up to Burzynski 
 It's up to Burzynski to show that his drug does work 
 And it's always been his burden of proof 
 He's the one that's been claiming this miracle cancer cure, forever_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well I'm sure, I'm sure they wouldn't have done things if they didn't see some evidence that it was working 
—————————————————————— 
 Um, I don 't know if you've read Jaffe's book 
—————————————————————— 
No I haven't read it  [44] 
—————————————————————— 
_There seems to have been a lot going on there you really should look at it because it 's it's it's kind of revealing 
 Um, that that that it seems that there was a lot of political pressure applied to the FDA which may have been, uh, uh, have influenced the way in which these these trials were approved 
 I I would say that it is a genuine con uh uh bit of confusion on the parts of Skeptics 
 We don't know why the phase 3 trial was approved 
 I don't know that we've seen even the phase 1 trials, we don't know why he's getting a phase 3 
 And there's a real story in that, we think_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:04:02 
—————————————————————— 
_Um, that we 'd love to see, however we can't see, however we can't see it because of proti protri proprietary uh protections that the FDA is giving to Burzynski, right ? 
 They're not sharing his trial designs because they are his trial designs, right? 
 That the makeup of his drug that he's distributing are his, uh design, and his intellectual property 
 So the FDA is protecting him, uh from outside scrutiny 
 While you may imagine that that, that that the FDA is is somehow antagonistic toward him 
 They've given him every opportunity, over 60 opportunities to prove himself worth uh their confidence and hasn't 
 Um, but I definitely recommend that you look at Jaffe's book and you will see, I think, um that um it's called um, uh Galileo's_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:05:00 
—————————————————————— 
I know what it's called  [44] 
—————————————————————— 
_You know what it 's called, okay, yeah 
 Um, definitely look at that 
 Um, you, you will see, the ways in which, the way that we got to this point, isn't necessarily having anything to do with the efficacy of the drug 
 That comes across very clearly 
 Um, you, you mentioned it yourself, he he's done well to listen to Jaffe's advice, right ?_ 
—————————————————————— 
Right 
—————————————————————— 
_So, there there 's a lot to that 
 Um, uh, but yeah, let me go back to the Twitter feed 
 Um_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well I'm just gonna say, you know, the F, the FDA doing what they've done, since they approved those 72 initial trials, pretty much speaks for itself  [45] 
 I mean they've had every opportunity to shut this down, since then 
—————————————————————— 
 Well it sounds to me like they 're they're not um, the the the you know, they've put the clinical hold on now because they now have evidence that somebody may have died because of the treatment 
—————————————————————— 
1:06:06 
—————————————————————— 
_Um, I don 't know what the state of that is right now 
 Um, uh, oh my gosh, um, let me see 
 Someone has just sent me a, a ah a link to, are you following the Hashtag, as this is going on_ 
—————————————————————— 
No, I'm just concentrating on what we're doing 
—————————————————————— 
_Okay 
 I'm doing, I'm doing the 2 things at once and it's um, ok ok well it's well ok I can't I can't go in and read that right now 
 Um, I would, ok let me tell you exactly what it will take, for me to come around and promote Burzynski 
 Um, for me, he needs to get a publication in a uh, yeah, uh uh uh publication in a peer-reviewed journal, a respected peer-reviewed journal, not like the the  Journal of Medical Hypothesis  or things we just made up_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:07:16 
—————————————————————— 
_Um, something, you know, a a good, respectable journal that oncologists would read, that research oncologists would read 
 I would need an completely independent group to replicate his findings, and then I'd be all for it 
 I would say that right now, the business model that the  Burzynski Clinic  seems to depend on, as best as I can tell from an outsider, that, um, uh, that it depends on people paying money up front 
 It doesn't depend on him developing and taking away a viable drug, that he can market to the entire world 
 His business model as best I can tell, is to keep it in house_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:08:03 
—————————————————————— 
_That seems, if it works, if his drug genuinely works, and he hasn 't sent it along to mass approval, where he gets, for a couple of years at least, you know, exclusive rights to produce and sell this stuff, for one of the most intractable diseases, uh that man eh can can can, you know, can get, um, that suggests to me that there's something else going on here 
 Now, someone has just sent a a note, uh that he has failed 3 different Institutional Review Board audits; this is Guy Chapman (@SceptiGuy), uh no other institution has a 3 for 3 fail, according to to Guy iye he knows no other one 
 Um, that 45% of phase 3 clinical trials fail due to deficient phase 2 design 
 Um, he has an approved phase 3, but phase 2 was deficient so phase 3 fails_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:09:07 
—————————————————————— 
 Do you think that that could possibly have anything to do with why we 're not seeing the phase 3 advance 
—————————————————————— 
Well #1 I don't think the one with brainstem glioma where they wanted to use radiation with ANP was really the right way to go, I mean he's already proven that uh he seems to have better results without  [12] 
—————————————————————— 
 He 's claimed 
—————————————————————— 
first starting radiation  [20] 
—————————————————————— 
_He 's claimed 
 That's a different thing altogether 
 And in fact_ 
—————————————————————— 
Yeah but the thing is radi, I, the FDA was not saying, ok, one study, one side of the study we're only going to use ANP, in the other side of the study we're going to use radiation and and ANP like like they would normally do 
 No, they wanted to make him use radiation in both sides of the study  [20] 
—————————————————————— 
 Well, you understand why they do that, because in order to, it 's 
—————————————————————— 
They don't do that with other drugs  [13] 
—————————————————————— 
 No, they do do this with other drugs, well, it depends on the type 
—————————————————————— 
1:10:01 
—————————————————————— 
_Some drugs it 's ethical to give something completely questionable, what they want to make sure that they at least get the standard care, you know which includes radiation 
 Um, and radiation does seem to extend life, reduce the size of some tumors some times 
 Um, do you concede, that in order to have a phase 3, you do not need to have a successful phase 2 ? 
 When 45% of phase 3 fail because they have a deficient phase 2 design, do you concede that ?_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well I don't buy anything Guy Chapman sells, considering his past record  [46] 
—————————————————————— 
_Well, ok 
 It doesn't matter where_ 
—————————————————————— 
(laughing) 
—————————————————————— 
 It doesn 't matter where it comes from uh, um 
—————————————————————— 
Well his theories are suspect, anything he hands out, let me tell ya  [47] 
—————————————————————— 
 So-kay, um that would be shooting the messenger as opposed to dealing with the question, but 
—————————————————————— 
But the question may be bogus, because of where the messenger has been bogus a lot of times before (laugh)  [48] 
—————————————————————— 
1:11:04 
—————————————————————— 
 the idea, the best, well, the best, well in that case the best response is "I don't know" 
—————————————————————— 
Well I'm just gonna say what I think about Chapman because he's proven himself, many times to be questionable 
 I don't see him on my blog responding to my criticism  [7] 
—————————————————————— 
_There 's something that that we don't know, you're coming, honestly we didn't know what to expect when we talked to you 
 We, were looking at the design, of your web-site and wondering whether or not we would be able to get a a coherent sentence out of you, because the web-site is disorganized, uh 
 Um, at at at at least it's the organization is not apparent to the readers 
 Um, and um according to_ 
—————————————————————— 
That's like, that's like saying that Gorski's web-site is disorganized, his blog is like anti vaccine one day, Burzynski the next, blah blah blah 
—————————————————————— 
 No, that is tied together 
—————————————————————— 
1:12:00 
—————————————————————— 
(laughing) 
—————————————————————— 
_But let me, we know that that the the, the central concern is Burzynski 
 Ah, the source of this ah of of those #'s that I just gave you, Chapman has just updated me and he says um that it is, and I'll go back to the, the ADR research . com issues in clinical research, so it's the question,  Bay Clinical  uh  Research and Clinical Development  ,a white paper called  " Why do so many phase 3 clinical trials fail ?" 
 Uh, it's prepared by Anistazios Retzios, Ph.D 
 Is Anistazios Retzios reliable ? 
 There is a correct here_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well how would I know ? 
 I don't have 
—————————————————————— 
_Exactly 
 That's the right answer 
 You don't know 
 You don't know 
 You need to look into it 
 Alright ? 
 Before you dismiss it you have to look into it_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:13:00 
—————————————————————— 
_Everytime somebody throws uh uh something to me, I have to look into it 
 That's just, it's my responsibility as a reader 
 Um_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well you didn't when I tried to get you to do stuff the 1st time, did ya ?  [2] 
—————————————————————— 
 What, what stuff would you like 
—————————————————————— 
(laughing) 
—————————————————————— 
_What stuff would you like me to do ? 
 I generally, I don't read your blog_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well I, the most, the mostly, excuse me, the most recent article I posted on there is the one about this particular conversation, where I went through all your comments that you had posted, and my response to them 
 And so I tried to consolidate everything into one, particular article 
—————————————————————— 
 Uh um, alright 
—————————————————————— 
And that's the newest article  [2] 
—————————————————————— 
_Okay,  I 'll look at that, and I will respond to it once I've taken a look at that, okay ? 
 Um, and  I 'll respond on your web-site 
 Um,  seems only fair 
 Um, one question I'd wondered, what is the Didymus Judas Thomas reference to_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:14:00 
—————————————————————— 
Well I thought that was pretty funny because doing biblical research, you come upon, Didymus Judas Thomas, or he's all, also known by other names 
 He's basically The Skeptic 
 And so, like I said, I consider myself to be Skeptic of  The Skeptics 
—————————————————————— 
 Oh, so this is the Doubting Thomas 
—————————————————————— 
I thought it was apropos 
 Of course 
—————————————————————— 
 This is the Doubting Thomas 
—————————————————————— 
I'm doubting  The Skeptics 
 Exactly 
—————————————————————— 
_Okay, so this is the one, you show me the, you put your your, the, your hand inside the wound 
 You know, Jesus says, basically, ok, bring it on, check me out, right ?_ 
—————————————————————— 
Exactly 
—————————————————————— 
_Okay 
 Alright 
 That that, I didn't, I didn't realize that he was also, that that was the same guy 
 So, it's it's the Doubting Thomas 
 Um, what we would say, um, is that if Burzynski is the savior that he claims to be, that he should, open up his trials, he should open up his uh research uh protocols um and just say, "Look, bring it on"_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:15:08 
—————————————————————— 
_Check out these wounds 
 But he's never done that 
 Instead he he he wants us to just take the words of of of of his apostles 
 I don't necessarily trust his apostles 
 I don't think that they're unbiased 
 (laughing) 
 I wanna see the data 
 I wanna see the the wounds in his hands and the the mark on his side_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well I like how  The Skeptics  say, you know, all of Burzynski's successes over the years are anecdotal and uh I consider on the same way that everything negative about Burzynski is anecdotal 
—————————————————————— 
_Oh, hey when when we talk about The Other Burzynski Patient Group, I don 't make any pretensions to make that my site proves anything 
 I I I really don't 
 It's not my job to prove anything 
 It's Burzynski's job 
 It is a researchers job to prove these things_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:16:00 
—————————————————————— 
Well my point is he's proven them to the FDA because they're the ones 
—————————————————————— 
_But we just pointed out, we just pointed out, that the FDA, often approves, phase 3 trials, based on flawed phase 2 clinical trials 
 That is therefor a real possibility in this case_ 
—————————————————————— 
Could be, but I would have to read, read the 
—————————————————————— 
_Yes you would 
 T t and what I would honestly expect and hope, is that you would be honest about this, to yourself, and and and that's the thing we don't, we often don't realize that we're not being honest with ourself 
 I try to fight against it, constantly 
 But, um, uh but the way that you'd earlier phrased your uh your response to "could you possibly be proved wrong ?", . . really did exclude other possibilities of of of of yourself being wrong 
 So if the FDA_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well when it comes to Guy Chapman, yeah 
—————————————————————— 
_Well I 'm not talking about the Guy Chapman 
 What you off, when I asked you, yourself, you know, what would prove you wrong, you said that the FDA hasn't approved a phase 3_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:17:03 
—————————————————————— 
_Well, ok 
 Let's let's back, let's back up 
 What would the FDA, what happens if the FDA occasionally op op opposes, approves uh phase 3 trials, based on bad phase 2 trials 
 Would that be, would that cause any doubt in your mind ? 
 About the efficacy of ANP_ 
—————————————————————— 
You still there ? 
—————————————————————— 
 Yeah, hello, yeah, you 're back 
—————————————————————— 
Yeah, something cut off there for awhile 
—————————————————————— 
_Yeah Google+ is a little wonky sometimes 
 But, would, does, if you were to learn, that sometimes phase 3 trials, uh, are approved, and failed, based on flawed phase 2, would, would that make you reconsider your position of the phase 3 being evidence that it works_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:18:00 
—————————————————————— 
Well I would certainly look at that, but then again I would also look at the FDA granting him Orphan Drug Designation  [10] 
—————————————————————— 
_Uh um could you send me that link, the, the, um . me see 
 I'm just looking at other things that are coming in on the Hashtag right now 
 Um, so the ANP is Orphan Drug status but is it Orphan Drug for glioma ?_ 
—————————————————————— 
Orphan Drug for brainstem glioma and all gliomas  [10] 
—————————————————————— 
 Is it sodium phenylbutyrate or is it the the versions of the drug, the AS10 stuff or A1 or whatever it 's called ? 
—————————————————————— 
Right, it's both AS10 AS2-1 and AS 
—————————————————————— 
 Clarification: A10 and AS2-1 
—————————————————————— 
_Okay, that 's what has Orphan Drug status 
 Alright, I'll look into that 
 I hope somebody is writing all this down out there, so that we can go back and look at these claims later, right ? _ 
—————————————————————— 
1:19:00 
—————————————————————— 
_So, oh, um 
 Do you have any questions for me ? 
 I've spent a lot of times asking questions of you_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well not really, since **you mentioned that you 'd go in and look at my most recent article, anything you show in there or any reply you give is going to cover, what we've gone over 
 And so we can re debate it there** 
—————————————————————— 
_Mhmm 
 Guy Chapman, throws up the the, the comment, permission to investigate is not evidence of anything other than evidence of a valid protocol, not a uh, evidence of efficacy, in and of itself 
 That's another comment 
 Um, alright then, this is your chance t, there are lots of people have lots of questions about me out there 
 Uh, about what my motivations are and such 
 I might as well put that out on the table just so it's on the record, is that I am taking exactly no money from anyone for this, and have gotten nothin' but grief from a lot of people, even people who (laugh),  even people who support me have given me grief for this 
 Um, just so that you know, um, there have been, some of the things that have happened, oh, this is an important point too 
 Um, that when we have criticized this, uh, a # of us, especially Gorski, uh myself, uh Rhys Morgan, uh, um, and and uh Popehat, the the lawyer, blog, uh, um, who else was on there, um, oh, the Merritts, uh, t, uh Wayne Merritt, and his family, people have been critical of of of Burzynski have faced retaliation for opposing him ah and intimidation, and including, um, I had my uh a couple weeks before Christmas my, my, the Chancellor of my University was contacted via e-mail, and uh Eric Merola said that I had been um, uh, been spreading mis truths about Burzynski, that I had been a be, on my my show um had said things that were demonstratively untrue, and he also said that the drug was FDA approved, which it, you know, that's not right 
 But um, he said that he was gonna do, talk about me in his new movie, in, uh, relat, in millions of homes, um, and he wanted to get a statement from the University_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:22:02 
—————————————————————— 
_The University of course ignored him, and immediately let me know that I was going to get smeared 
 Um, I consulted my lawyer and uh uh, you know, the best course of action was figured out, and um uh a Gorski has had his accreditation board contacted, he's had his bosses contacted, Rhys Morgan received threats of liable suits from somebody who had been hired, by the clinic, to clean up his on-line reputation if he didn't take down his on-line review of Burzynski, uh, had his a picture of his house sent to him, clearly the message being, "We know where you live kid," uh, Wayne Merritt; a pancreatic cancer patient, this is something that, that people generally, do not recover from, like generally, die from, received phone calls at home, from, this individual, threatening him with lawsuits; he doesn't have a law degree so he's misrepresenting himself_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:23:15 
—————————————————————— 
_Um, but all of this, was done, to critics 
 Do you think that is deserved ? 
 Do you think that that is right ?_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well I've specifically stated on my blog that Marc Stephens uh obviously didn't know what he was doing and went about it the wrong way 
 My position was he should of bou, got around it, gone about it the way I did, which is, I blog, and show where Rhys is wrong  [49]  , I blog and show where Gorski is wrong  [40]  , I blog and show where you are wrong  [2]  , or Josephine Jones  [50]  , or Guy Chapman  [7]  , etcetera 
 And, eh, y'all have every opportunity to come on my blog, and I've had very few takers, uh, one claiming to be from Wikipedia, who I shot down  [51] 
—————————————————————— 
1:24:04 
—————————————————————— 
And hasn't come back 
 So, you know, I am welcome to anybody trying to come on my blog, and prove what I posted is wrong, and debate anything 
 Unlike some of The Skeptics I don't block people on my blog 
—————————————————————— 
 Mhmm 
—————————————————————— 
I don't give lame reasons for blocking people on my blog because I'm an American and I actually believe in  " Free Speech" 
—————————————————————— 
_Well to be fair 
 It it it doesn't strike me as necessarily a  " Free Speech"  issue, you know_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well to me it is when Forbes removes all my comments, in response to Skeptics some, and I showed this from screen-shots 
 You know, stuff like that  [52] 
—————————————————————— 
 Was it down-voted ? 
—————————————————————— 
Oh no 
—————————————————————— 
 No 
—————————————————————— 
It wasn't down-voted 
—————————————————————— 
 Mhmm 
—————————————————————— 
They, I mean I've got screen-shots of where my comments were there, between other people's comments, and uh, and they just decided to remove all my comments, and I blogged specifically about, you know, what they did and, uh, Gorski's good friend and pal who authored that particular article 
—————————————————————— 
 Mhmm 
—————————————————————— 
So I, I like how  The Skeptics  run things, you know 
—————————————————————— 
1:25:14 
—————————————————————— 
 Well we do have for for for for one thing, um, I guess to understand is that we are uh motivated by um uh a respect, this is the one thing that that all Skeptics I think um are uh respect critical thinking, um, and um respect scientific uh a we we 're mostly scientific enthusiasts, there's some Skeptics who are not um, uh, you know oh u space nerds, or whatever who are um just sc scholars and the humanities but for the most part we all respect scientific consensus and we respect scientific method and have an enthusiasm for living in the real world, this is something that like all of us us are about 
—————————————————————— 
1:26:00 
—————————————————————— 
_And to that end, sometimes that influence is how we run, is how we decide to run our personal web-sites 
 Um, uh, that whether or not we want our, to give a platform to people who disagree with us, um, you know, uh, when we do, uh . . it it is our sandbox, you know, right ? 
 This, this (laughter), we're allowed to to let whoever we want into our sandbox if we, you know, uh if we want_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well I think that people who really believe in  " Free Speech,"  and when it's done rationally, I mean, Gorski would never, really respond to any of my questions, so I  [53] 
—————————————————————— 
_Did he, did he leave them up ? 
 Did he leave them up ?_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well I know that he specifically removed a review I did uh of his review of Burzynski I on his web, on his blog 
 But he's pretty much left a lot of my comments up that I've seen 
 Uh, but he never really responded to my questions about, what he based his beliefs upon 
—————————————————————— 
1:27:00 
—————————————————————— 
 Right, um, do you think that he is required to answer you 
—————————————————————— 
Well I would think, if you're going to base your position on a certain thing, and then you can't back it up with scientific literature, uh, you should answer, maybe not specifically to me, but answer the question 
 Answer to your readers 
—————————————————————— 
 Right 
—————————————————————— 
You know, I can tell his readers come on my blog because it shows that they come on my blog 
—————————————————————— 
_Mhmm 
 Um so a a question uh why were why do you have so many Twitter and Wikipedia sock-puppets_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well the reason I have so many Twitter things is because, obviously, some of  The Skeptics  will be on there lying about some tweet I sent, and so Wikipedia, excuse me Twitter will do a little ol', do their little, hey we're going to block your account while we do blah blah blah, and I'm not gonna waste my time, going through their little review process, I'll just create another uh Twitter address because, like, you know, if you read the Twitter information you can have a ridiculous amount of uh Twitter I.D.'s, and I'll just use another Twitter I.D. and continue on 
—————————————————————— 
1:28:15 
—————————————————————— 
And so Wikipedia can say what they want, because I've only ever used one I.P., I've only got on there during one time, and when they finally said hey, you know, we're not gonna uh grant your appeal, I completely left their web-site alone, so all that stuff  [54] 
—————————————————————— 
_Wikipedia 
 You left Wikipedia_ 
—————————————————————— 
that they post  [55] 
 Yep  [56] 
 So all that garbage that they posted about me, about how I supposedly got on-line, on these other articles is just entirely B.S.  [57] 
—————————————————————— 
_Mhmm 
 Um a_ 
—————————————————————— 
And if they can prove otherwise, I'd sure like to see it  [58] 
—————————————————————— 
_Uh We have uh a response from David James, everyone uh gave you a fair shout 
 You were a spammer plain and simple 
 You couldn't, you couldn't 
 work out your questions_ 
—————————————————————— 
But that's what y'all always say 
 That's what y'all like to say, about everything 
—————————————————————— 
_Twitter does not 
 Twitter does not block people for for arguing 
 Only for spamming and policy violations_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:29:05 
—————————————————————— 
Yeah I'm sure that's what they like to say 
 I mean, you can report an e-mail, or report a twit, and they'll block it 
 But um they'll never come back and say, and this is why we blocked you, for this particular twit, for this particular reason 
—————————————————————— 
_Mhmm 
 Okay 
 Um, let me see 
 Each new account was blocked for additional violations of policies 
 Um, this is a uh uh referring to the Wikipedia rules too 
 Um, so_ 
—————————————————————— 
Wikipedia is a joke  [59] 
—————————————————————— 
 Um, Wikipedia, do you know why um they 've locked the Burzynski page ? 
—————————————————————— 
Oh sure, I'm sure, that's no problem  [60] 
 I don't have any problem with them locking that  [61] 
 You know, I could tell when I was on there, and when Merola was on there, because he had a different I.P. address than me, I could tell they were his questions because of the way they were formed  [62] 
—————————————————————— 
1:30:04 
—————————————————————— 
So I said, well they're not answering his questions, I'll just take on that role, and uh ask his questions and ask further questions, and they didn't wanna deal with it, you know  [63] 
—————————————————————— 
 Did you notice the part where he threatened, did you notice the part where he threatened to expose Wikipedia 
—————————————————————— 
Expose them for what ? 
 For doing what they do, which is basically provide false information and one-sided information ?  [64] 
—————————————————————— 
_We have to, well, they they uh are looking that it 's not one-sided information they want to show 
 Like they discuss, there is controversy about this guy_ 
—————————————————————— 
Oh, please 
 They get on there and they say hey, Lola Quinlan filed a lawsuit, but they don't tell you anything else 
 They don't tell you, you know, Jaffe's side of the story, and her lawyer's side of the story 
—————————————————————— 
 Yeah, Jaffe 's on there 
—————————————————————— 
(laughing) 
—————————————————————— 
 Jaffe 's on there 
—————————————————————— 
Oh Jaffe's on there but on that specific article about Lola, they didn't say, here's the article that was posted on uh Lola's attorney's web-site that, that mentions both his responses and Jaffe's responses, to the uh lawsuit 
—————————————————————— 
1:31:10 
—————————————————————— 
 uh well you could add that if you hadn 't gotten blocked 
—————————————————————— 
Uh, trust me, I tried to add that and they wouldn't add it 
—————————————————————— 
1:32:20 
_Okay 
 Um, so, who are you_ 
—————————————————————— 
(laughter) 
 You know,  The Skeptics  like to be nasty, and so, I've been like Josephine Jones (@_JosephineJones) 
 If she wants to play anonymous, I'll play anonymous  [65] 
—————————————————————— 
 She 's gotten threats 
—————————————————————— 
Well, I don't threaten people 
 I don't threaten Gorski 
 I don't send letters to people's employers 
 I deal with them directly, and, you know, if if they won't answer questions, then, you know, I'll just post them on my blog for other people to see, and question uh themselves 
—————————————————————— 
 So we don 't know who you are 
—————————————————————— 
1:33:01 
—————————————————————— 
Like I said, I'm going to be like Josephine Jones  [66] 
—————————————————————— 
_Like, she has suffered at the hands of some really mess, and she 's also, you have to realize she's in the U.K, where libel laws are very lax at this point 
 That's changing, ah, but uh, the the legitimate criticism, there is a big case last, me maybe 2 years ago of Simon Singh, talking about an alternative therapy, and, um, he was just saying that there's no evidence for it but it's promoted by um chiropractors, or something, or something like that 
 And he got slapped with a libel suit that cost him several years of his life and a lot of money 
 Um, so, there are several reasons why someone in the U.K. might uh be uh reticent to use their real name um, uh, and legitimate reasons 
 Um, in the U.S., I'm not sure that there is_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:34:00 
—————————————————————— 
_I 've been using my real name for a long time now 
 Um, you know, Gorski blogs under his real name, and is critical of uh, uh, also, let's face it, everyone know, knows who  " Orac"  is 
 Um, how do we know that you don't work for the clinic ?_ 
—————————————————————— 
Because I've said so 
 I'm not even in Texas 
 I was born in Texas, but I don't live in Texas 
 I don't even, didn't even, uh live in Houston 
—————————————————————— 
 Mhm 
—————————————————————— 
Wasn't even close to Houston 
—————————————————————— 
_Well see, one of the the problems is, Ju, I don 't know if you were around for the BurzynskiSaves thing 
 Did you ever see that account ?_ 
—————————————————————— 
Oh, of course, I, I've seen a lot of stuff goes on Twitter  [67] 
 I've see y'all saying "Oh, we're  " The Skeptics"  and y'all know are names," but, there's a lot of Skeptics that post on there with pseudonyms, also  [68] 
—————————————————————— 
_Mhmm 
 Right 
 Oh no, I mean you have a right to do that but but I I've found that posting under a pseudonym diminishes my credibility 
 Um, so, . . the quote was uh um, uh, "Happily promotes bogus therapies," was Simon Singh's quote that got him sued_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:35:10 
—————————————————————— 
_Um, but Josephine Jones does it to, quote "protect her family" 
 Um 
 So there's that 
 Um, are you afraid for you're family ?_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well, I'm just not sure how some of these uh Skeptics will react considering their past behavior  [69] 
 I mean, when Skeptics refuse to, I mean they block you on your blogs  [70] 
 They block your comments  [71] 
 You know, they decide, "Well, I'm maybe going to accept one comment from you, but I won't accept anymore  [72] 
 You know, to me that's just ridiculous  [73] 
 Uh, the action on  Forbes  that happened, the action on  The Guardian  that happened, where, you know, you had someone on Gorski's blog basically lie to the  Gua  , to  The Guardian  to get them to get them to uh block my comment  [74] 
 So, you know, I'm Skeptical of  The Skeptics  and their uh and what they would do  [75] 
—————————————————————— 
1:36:01 
—————————————————————— 
 Um, you don 't see that there would be anything to gain from, from going on-record ? 
—————————————————————— 
Not really  [76] 
 I like my anonymity just like Josephine Jones likes hers  [77] 
 I mean, I will read her stuff and reply to it and treat it seriously jus, just like any other blogger  [78] 
—————————————————————— 
_Um I I haven 't, I've never, honestly, I've never seen a Skeptic actually go after a person individually 
 Um, you know, uh, you, unless they were doing colossal harm to people 
 Um, to to focus on an, uh, let's say, call someone's work for um, yeah 
 Cite one example, of a Skeptic making shit for a Burzynski shill or anyone else in real life 
 That's a quote 
 That's, that's something coming in from, from Guy_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:36:00 
—————————————————————— 
Well the thing is, some of these Skeptics use names, and they're not necessarily their real names 
 So, you know, I've seen 
—————————————————————— 
_Like had anyone ever contacted Sheila Herron, or has anyone to to um, go after her job, or go after um, you know, my brother has gotten stuff from people 
 He didn't tell me because he didn't want to upset me, but my brother gets things from Burzynski supporters that are violent and threatening 
 I get letters telling me that I suck cancer's dick 
 Um, I I've all sorts of things um, and I just, I've never seen that, that intrusion into real life on the part of uh, um, uh, Skeptics 
 I've never seen them doing that type of of of stuff 
 I've never seen them threatening bogus lawsuits 
 Um, and I I I wonder there, if there is some sort of, what do you think accounts for that, that difference?_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well I think that some people just have bad manners 
—————————————————————— 
 Mhmm 
—————————————————————— 
I mean see, I've seen Skeptics on Twitter basically harass someone pro-Burzynski and keep sending them tweets, and that person specifically send them a tweet saying please keep, stop sending me tweets 
 You know, they didn't go in and ask Twitter to block the, that particular person 
 That person just kept sending them tweets 
—————————————————————— 
 Mhmm 
—————————————————————— 
So, you know, I've seen that stuff before 
—————————————————————— 
 I 've I've I've shown up on, you know, as you, as you might, I imagine you moni, you monitor the Hashtag, right ? 
—————————————————————— 
Yeah, I'll look at it, and if you notice, I don't uh, I usually don't reply to Skeptics individually because I pretty much figure that y'all are gonna try and get my next account blocked whenever I do that kind of junk, so, well, you know, I just post what I want to post, under the Hashtag 
—————————————————————— 
1:38:01 
—————————————————————— 
_Okay 
 Um, which is, which is your right 
 Um, uh, but every so often I jump in and say, you know, this movie has some flaws in it 
 You know, that's something I say rather frequently 
 Um, and I invite people, if they're interested, to take a look at a couple of links 
 I don't, I, you'll notice that I no longer force people to like, "Well how do you explain this ?," because that doesn't seem to be very persuasive, or work at all 
 Ah, only people who are open minded to having their mind changed, those are the only ones I want to talk to 
 So I give them a choice 
 Kind of like  Morpheus  in  The Matrix  really 
 Um, b, that was a joke for me 
 Um (laugh), um anyway 
 Um, but, it it I, honestly, I would encourage you to go on-record, um, but I have, less than nothing invested in that, so, um_ 
—————————————————————— 
**(Why would I want to reveal my identity, when David H. Gorski, M.D., Ph.D., FACS, a/k/a  " Orac"  claimed that he was pretty certain he knew who I was ? 
 Just Bring it, Gorski)** 
 
—————————————————————— 
1:39:00 
—————————————————————— 
 Uh, what 's next for you 
—————————————————————— 
Well I'll just keep reviewing the, any inaccurate statements I see posted 
 You know, it depends on if it's Gorski, you know 
 Gorski's gone on there and posted inaccurate stuff, and I call him out, you know he's basically said on his blog, you know, if I do something inaccurate, you know, I'll 'fess up to it 
 Well, I've pointed out where he's done that and said "Hey, you said you were gonna 'fess up to it" 
 If I said on my blog that I was going to 'fess up to doing something wrong, and you caught me, well, then I should, come out and say, "Okay, you got me" 
 But Gorski won't even do that, you know, he just continues to go on down the road, as if 
—————————————————————— 
_Well what happens 
 Well what happens if he doesn't understand what you're saying ?_ 
—————————————————————— 
(laughing) 
—————————————————————— 
 I mean one of the 
—————————————————————— 
excuse 
—————————————————————— 
_I mean seriously 
 Well, one of the problems I think that a lot of Skeptics have had, in in back channel discussions about this is that we don't understand exactly what you're saying_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:40:01 
—————————————————————— 
_We certainly don 't understand why you're so attached to him if you've never had any uh, you know, close dealing with uh, uh, with Burzynski 
 We don't really understand that_ 
—————————————————————— 
I find, I find 
—————————————————————— 
_Actually, especially when you consider, that all the information that we 've put forward, that we've backed up with statements from uh, you know, uh, it, it, the statements that we have from from patients saying that you know, we've we've, we were told that, no that's not exactly, they put it usually that but that that we believe that getting worse is getting better 
 Like how could someone continue to defend someone, when we pile up all of these different, you know, sources, saying the same thing ? 
 It it is, it is beyond us and we wonder if there's absolutely anything that we could say that would convince you otherwise _ 
—————————————————————— 
You know, I'm just going to let the FDA do their job, and let y'all speculate all y'all want 
 Uh, I mean (laugh) 
—————————————————————— 
 But, I mean, but that means 
—————————————————————— 
1:41:00 
—————————————————————— 
See, I'm here for full discussion 
 And y'all don't seem to want to discuss, after y'all just go out there and spam the Internet with garbage, that you don't back-up with citations and references and links 
—————————————————————— 
_Everything on The Other Other Burzynski Patient Group is referenced 
 It goes_ 
—————————————————————— 
But some of your other stuff that you tweeted that you haven't backed up with links, and some of the stuff on  thehoustoncancerquack  isn't backed-up with links, and Gorski's stuff 
—————————————————————— 
_There 's very little on 
 thehoustoncancerquack 
 There's very little on 
 thehoustoncancerquack  in the 1st place_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well, that and the  anp4all  one 
 isn't backed up 
—————————————————————— 
_Eh, right 
 The they both go to the same place 
 Uh un but, you know, we, the thing that that totally befuddles us, and is just endlessly frustrating, is like how many more examples, of patients believing that getting worse is getting better, and it's not us saying it, it's the patients saying it_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:42:00 
—————————————————————— 
 And how many more of those patients do we need to to give you before you will like reconsider that perhaps you might be wrong ? 
—————————————————————— 
When the FDA says he's wrong 
 I mean, I'm not, I'm not just gonna accept your story 
—————————————————————— 
_I don 't, the thing is though that, that that's a inver, shifting the burden of proof off of Burzynski 
 Burzynski has to prove them wrong, has to prove him right 
 The FDA is not there to say this doesn't work _ 
—————————————————————— 
Burzynski provides the FDA with the evidence, and the FDA makes the 
—————————————————————— 
 The evidence would be 
—————————————————————— 
the FDA doesn't approve a drug 
—————————————————————— 
 The evidence 
—————————————————————— 
if something's not proved 
—————————————————————— 
_The evidence would be phase 2 trials 
 And ev the evidence would be a completed and published phase 3 trial 
 That's not forthcoming 
 The phase 3_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well you know that he's trying 
 I mean, y'all can sit there and jump up and down all you want 
—————————————————————— 
_You don 't know that he's trying 
 He'd start completing these trials 
 And he would, he would be soliciting um, uh, lots of um, uh, you know, you know he'd be putting out papers constantly um and if the the British Medical Journal example's anything uh representative of how Burzynski works, he'd immediately tell everyone that his he's being . . blackballed by the, by the journal, even when it's just a courtesy that he gets a a rejection_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:43:30 
—————————————————————— 
_So, I mean, honestly, um, saying "Well, when the F, FDA tells you that it doesn't work, the FDA's never gonna say that because that's not their job 
 So, given that what would, how many more patients do we have to show you before you consider that you may be wrong ?_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:44:00 
—————————————————————— 
Well, I'm gonna go with what the FDA is gonna do still because they're running the show 
—————————————————————— 
_That 's not an option, because they're never gonna do it 
 They relinquish, a lot of authority, over to Burzynski, and his Institutional Review Board, which, I would mention, has failed 3 reviews in a row 
 Right ? 
 It is Burzynski's job to be convincing 
 It is not our uh, uh, it it it he hasn't produced in decades 
 In decades 
 In hundreds and hundreds of patients, who've payed to be on this_ 
—————————————————————— 
What I find funny is that y'all complain, "Well, he hasn't published, uh a final report" 
 Well his 1st final, was completed in 2009, and like I said, the M.D. Anderson 2006 study wasn't published until 2, 2013 
 I mean, so y'all can jump up and down all you want 
 Y'all want a final report 
 Well, the final report will be done when the clinical trial is over 
—————————————————————— 
 Hell, we 'd we'd we'd like a prelim, well when you're talking about something that is so difficult as brainstem glioma, that type of thing gets, really does in the publishing stream get fast-tracked there 
—————————————————————— 
Well, unless you're  The Lancet  , I guess 
—————————————————————— 
_they test it 
 Yeah, and they they they want uh, that was evidence of fast-tracking is what, that rejection was uh e was very quickly 
 Um, so, uh, uh again, the FDA is not the arbiter of this 
 It's ultimately Burzynski 
 So, how long will it be before Burzynski doesn't publish, that you decide that uh perhaps he's he's, doesn't have the goods ?_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well, I'm not gonna get into speculation, I'm just going to wait and see 
—————————————————————— 
_You 've been speculating about what the FDA's motivation are like crazy 
 Why not speculate about Burzynski a little bit_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well, how have I been speculating ? 
—————————————————————— 
1:46:00 
—————————————————————— 
 Well actually I 'm not even asking you to speculate about Burzynski, I'm only asking you to tell me, how long would it take, uh how, for him to go unpublished like this, um, for this long, before you would doubt it ? 
—————————————————————— 
what the journals keep saying, in response 
—————————————————————— 
 What ? 
—————————————————————— 
You know, are they going to give  The Lancet  response, like they did in 2 hours and such, saying, "Well, we think your message would be best heard elsewhere," or they gonna gonna give  The Lancet  response of, "Well, we don't have room in our publication this time, well, because we're full up, so, try and pick another place 
 
_But these but but but that doesn 't have any bearing on 
 That doesn't 
 Oh I'm not asking you how long, how long, would it take you for you to start doubting whether or not he has the goods ? 
 How long would it take ? 
 It's a it's a it's a question that should be answered by a number uh uh months ? 
 Years ? 
 How long ? 
 It's been 15 years already_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well, you like to jump up and down with the 15 year quote, but then again I always get back to, Hey, it's when, when the report, when the clinical trial is done 
—————————————————————— 
1:47:06 
—————————————————————— 
Not that he's been practicing medicine medicine for 36 years, or whatever, it's when the clin, clinical trial was done 
—————————————————————— 
_I could push it back to 36 years 
 He hasn't shown that it works for 36 years 
 I can do that 
 I was being nice_ 
—————————————————————— 
The FDA A believes there is evidence of efficacy 
—————————————————————— 
 Perhaps based on bad phase 2 
—————————————————————— 
Well, we don't know that 
 We don't have the Freedom of Information Act information 
—————————————————————— 
_He withdrew 
 He withdrew the the phase 3 clinical trial 
 I that before recruiting, 
although I've seen lots of people say they were on a phase 3 clinical trial 
 I wonder how that happened_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well, we know what happened in the movie because Eric particularly covered that when they tried to get what, what, was it 200 or 300 something institutions to take on a phase 3, and they refused 
—————————————————————— 
1:48:01 
—————————————————————— 
 Uh did do do you think that if they thought that he was a real doctor that they all would have refused like that ? 
—————————————————————— 
Well, Eric gave the reasons that they said they would not take a particular uh phase 3 
 And so using that excuse that you you just gave there, I'm not even gonna buy that one, because that's not one of the reasons 
—————————————————————— 
 He 's changed things 
—————————————————————— 
Eric said they gave 
—————————————————————— 
_That **  The Lancet ** is a top-tier journal like  New England Journal of Medicine 
 It's basically be, besieged by uh 100's of people submitting their, their, their reports 
 Um, it's just, you know, let's say he, someone has such a thin publishing record as Burzynski does, do you think that it's likely that he will ever get in a top-tier journal ? 
 What about the the  Public Library of Science  ? 
 It's not the only journal there 
 What about  BMC Cancer  ? 
 There's lots of places that he can go_ 
—————————————————————— 
We'll I'm 
—————————————————————— 
_Um, and he doesn 't seem to to have evailed himself of that, as far as I can tell 
 And I would know because he'd get rejected, or he'd be crowing, you know_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:49:02 
—————————————————————— 
_Either way, he 's gonna tell us what happens 
 He told us what happened with  The Lancet  , you know 
 I don't have any evidence that suggests to me that he's even trying_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well, I'm, I'm sure that they're going to keep you appraised just like they have in the past, just like Eric has done in the past 
 So 
 I mean, we'll see what happens with the Japanese study 
—————————————————————— 
_So let 's go back to this 
 How long will it take ? 
 How long will it take before you, the Japanese study's interesting too because we should be able to find that in the Japanese science databases, and we can find, we can't find it at all 
 We can't find it anywhere 
 And, and those are in English, so it's not a language problem 
 We can't find that anywhere 
 We've asked 
 We asked Rick Schiff, for, for that study 
 And, and it hasn't come to us 
 He is now I believe on the Board of Directors, over there_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:50:00 
—————————————————————— 
_He should have access to this 
 We can't get it 
 How how long will it take before you recognize that, nothing is forthcoming ? 
 How long would that take ?_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well that's like me asking "How long is it going to take for y'all's, y'all's Skeptics to respond to my questions ?" 
 Because y'all haven't been forthcoming 
—————————————————————— 
 Well, I mean, were talking about a blog here 
—————————————————————— 
(laughing) 
—————————————————————— 
_We 're talking about life 
 No, we're talking about a blogger's feelings in that case 
 In in this case we're talking about, 1,000's of patients, over the course of of of generations, you know 
 This is important stuff 
 This is not eh eh equating what's happening to to patients with what's happening to you is is completely off-kilter as far as I can tell 
 It's nothing 
 It's nothing like you not getting to say something on my web-site 
 You know 
 This is they they have thrown in with Burzynski, and they've trusted him, and he's produced nothing 
 Nothing of substance_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:51:00 
—————————————————————— 
_Nothing thas that has made all of that um, uh, n nothing th th th that uh his peers would take seriously 
 The other thing that that that strikes me now is that, you know, you you you you keep saying that, well Eric is going to to share things with you 
 Does it ever concern you eh uh eh occur to you that Eric might not be reliable ?_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well, he gave you  The Lancet  information and he posted the e-mail in the movie, and Josephine Jones posted a copy of it 
—————————————————————— 
_He then, and then he 
 And then he he, you know, the the the the dialogue that sprung up around that was, well see, he's never going to get to get published 
 Well you're just setting yourself up for wish fulfillment 
 You want him to be, persecuted, so you are ecstatic when he doesn't get to publish, which is unfortunate for all the cancer patients, who really thought that one day, all the studies were going to be published_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:52:00 
—————————————————————— 
Well, y'all are free to, you know, claim that all you want, because I don't always agree with Eric, and uh, he's free to express his opinion 
—————————————————————— 
 Where has Eric been wrong ? 
—————————————————————— 
Well I don't necessarily believe, what Eric would say about, you know,  The Lancet  that refused to publish the 2nd one, for the reasons he stated, and which y'all have commented on, including Gorski 
 You know, I don't necessarily agree with that 
 I am more agreeable to y'all, saying that, you know, they're busy, they've got other things to do, but I'm kind of still laughing at their 1st response which he showed in the movie about how they felt about, you know his results would be better in some other publication 
 I thought that was kind of a ridiculous response to give someone 
—————————————————————— 
_It 's it's it's it's a form letter 
 You know 
 They're just saying, "No thanks" 
 "Thanks, but no thanks" is what they were saying, in the most generic way possible 
 Like I said, they're besieged by researchers trying to publish_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:53:05 
—————————————————————— 
Well you would think that if its a form letter they would use the same form that they used the 2nd time 
 You know, they didn't use the same wording that they used the 1st time 
 I would have think that, you know, their 2nd comment 
—————————————————————— 
_So, so, possibly 
 So possibly what you are saying is that they in fact have read it, and after having read it they've rejected it 
 Is that what you're saying ? 
 Because that's what peer-review is_ 
—————————————————————— 
Nah, I'm not saying that they did that all 
 I'm just sayin', you know, that they gave, 2 different responses, and I would think that the 2nd one they gave 
—————————————————————— 
_Do you know it was the same editor, that it came from the same desk ? 
 You can't make that assumption that that the form letter will be the same form letter every time 
 I mean you just can't 
 I mean in in some ways we have a lot of non-information that you're filling in, with what you expect, as as opposed to what's actually really there, and I I I just think you're putting too much uh stock in one uh, uh, in in in in this uh the publication kerfuffle_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:54:16 
—————————————————————— 
 Um 
—————————————————————— 
Well I find it funny, something along the lines of, you know, "We believe your message would be received better elsewhere, you know 
 I don't see that as a normal response, a scientific publication would send to someone trying to publish something 
 I mean, to me that sounds, like, if you're doing that, and you're  The Lancet Oncology  , maybe you need to set some different procedures in place, 'cuz you would think that with such a great scientific peer-reviewed magazine, that they would have structured things in as far as how they do their operations 
—————————————————————— 
_Well, not necessarily 
 I've been in any # of professional groups where the organization is just not optimal, and publications certainly th there are all sorts of pressures from all sorts of different places_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:55:08 
—————————————————————— 
_I I have no problems whatsoever with seeing that this might not be completely uh um uh streamlining uniform processes as possible 
 The fact that it's not uniform, doesn't have anything to do with Burzynski not publishing, not producing good data 
 Not just going to a, you know, god, even if, even if, let's put it this way, even if he went to a pay to play type publication where you have to pay in order to get your manuscript accepted; and he has the money to do this, it wouldn't take that much, and he were to put out a good protocol, and he were to show us his data, and he would make his, his his stuff accessible to us, then we could validate it, then we could look at it and say, "Yeah, this is good," or "No, this is the problem, you have to go back and you have to fix this" 
 Right ? 
 So we really, every time we talk about the letter that he got, yeah that doesn't have much to do with anything, really_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:56:02 
—————————————————————— 
_We wanna see the frickin ' data 
 And if he had a cure for some cancers that otherwise don't have reliable treatments, he has an obligation to get that out there anyway he can 
 And if if peer-review doesn't, you know, play a, if peer-review can't do it, you know, isn't fast enough for him, then he should take it to the web, and he should send copies out to every pediatric, uh, you know, oncologist that there is 
 That's the way to do it_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well, I'm sure, I'm sure Gorski would have a comment about that, as he's commented previously about how he thinks uh Burzynski should publish 
—————————————————————— 
_Oh I, I I I certainly don 't think that he would put a lot of stock in it, but I, I, I know Dave Gorski enough, he wants this to work 
 He has patients who are dying, you know 
 And if if if let's say that that Burzynski could get ah his gene-targeted therapy to work on breast cancer patients in in a reliable way, that would be, such a help to these people, that that Gorski's trying to help_ 
—————————————————————— 
1:57:10 
—————————————————————— 
_And, it it it doesn 't make sense, I mean, there, some of the best um, one of the the most important developments in medical history, was the development of of just washing your hands uh uh before uh uh going in and delivering a baby 
 Right ? 
 The guy who did it, was a colossal jerk, but it still worked and it's the standard now 
 Right ? 
 Um, yea, it doesn't matter now whether or not Burz, whether or not Gorski agrees with how Burzynski publishes 
 It's the, it's the data itself 
 If if Burzynski is is, is confident in his data, he will put it out there 
 Right ? 
 One way or the other_ 
—————————————————————— 
Like I said before 
 Like I said before on my blog, you know, even if Burzynski publishes his phase 2 information, Gorski can just jump up and down and say, "Well, that just shows evidence of efficacy, you know, it's not phase 3, so it doesn't really prove it" 
—————————————————————— 
1:58:04 
—————————————————————— 
So then he can go on, you know, for however many years he wants to 
—————————————————————— 
_But he is a, the thing is, the thing is, you thing you have to understand is Gorski, Gorski is a genuine expert, in matters re re regarding on oncology studies 
 I mean, he has a_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well, 
—————————————————————— 
_He, He 's able to convince people, he's able to convince people, on the strength of his record, to give him money to carry out research 
 People who know what they're talking about 
 To give him money to carry out his research 
 Right ?_ 
—————————————————————— 
This is, this is a guy who must phone it in because, he went in there and posted the old Josephine Jones response that, you know, no drugs had been approved by the FDA without their final phase 2 publication 1st being published, which was not a factual statement, and you've made the same statement 
 So I, I'm thinking that Gorski just bought her statement and took it and ran with it, and before he fact-checked it, and what, what happened, it was wrong 
—————————————————————— 
1:59:00 
—————————————————————— 
I mean, Gorski needs to stop phoning stuff in, and check his sources before he posts stuff, because I've found many cases where, he hasn't seemed to do that, and that's why I question him 
—————————————————————— 
_Well what about all the other physicians, um, going back long before the Burzynski thing broke on-line 
 Of all these patients, with whom they have long-established relationships, and then doctors essentially after years, of treating these patients, basically saying, "I can't work with you anymore if you go to Burzynski" 
 What about that ? 
 Di, are all of these doctors just as biased ?_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well, I found it interesting that uh the one on the,  Burzynski 2  , you know he gave his ex excuses for not, working with uh, that patient, and, but yet, he was the same doctor that treated a another Burzynski patient, according to the movie 
—————————————————————— 
2:00:00 
—————————————————————— 
I mean, so what does he do ? 
 Pick and choose ? 
 Or do doctors pick and choose over there in Britain ? 
—————————————————————— 
 Did he get burned at some point ? 
—————————————————————— 
Well, the movie didn't say anything 
—————————————————————— 
_We don 't know 
 Yeah, well, you wouldn't expect Eric Merola to say that he got, that a doctor got burned 
 Would you ?_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well, I fail to see these doctors on there, providing any factual information, anywhere on the Internet about, uh their disagreements, in a serious way, instead of just making these over-broad statements, you know, "He hasn't published anything in the blah blah blah," and 
—————————————————————— 
 But he, he doesn 't have, he hasn't given us his data 
—————————————————————— 
Well, he's provided some data, and specifically 4 publications 
—————————————————————— 
 He 's given, he's given, he's given case studies 
—————————————————————— 
He's given more than the case studies 
—————————————————————— 
_He 's done 
 Okay_ 
—————————————————————— 
He's done more than the case studies 
 He's specifically given uh, almost all the information om an oncologist would want 
 And Gorski, and Gorski 
—————————————————————— 
 Except for a ph, completed phase 3 clinical trial 
—————————————————————— 
(laughing) 
 I mean, I love Gorski, but he comes up with these stupid excuses like, "Well, Burzynski is not an oncologist" 
—————————————————————— 
2:01:00 
—————————————————————— 
Well, Gorski doesn't go go in there and look at his other, his phase 2 clinical trial publications, as far as the preliminary reports, and look at the co-authors, and see if any of those guys are oncologists, and that they're working with Gorski, I mean they're working with Burzynski 
 I find that ridiculous 
—————————————————————— 
_Yeah 
 One of the things, one of the things that I've noticed going through these um, well, well there there is that 
 Uh, Guy Chapman, "It's a blog, not a peer-reviewed publication"  [79] 
 Um, almost no treatment goes out without trials 
 Massive amounts of data are required 
 Um, so, it it is kind of, slightly disingenuous to hold uh Gorski to the same . . standard that you would, it on his blog 
 I think that professionally he would make, he he he would follow-up on these things, but u what I've noticed when you you mention these other people who are working with with Burzynski as co-investigators, the co- investigators don't seem to have access to these, to these records_ 
—————————————————————— 
2:02:00 
—————————————————————— 
_Um, you know, when they have to, when a patient has to, and often you have someone like a pediatrician, uh, signing on um uh to eh eh to work with with, uh and arrange care for patients when they 're out of state, away from Burzynski 
 Um, it's it's it's often not an oncologist 
 It's accurate to say that B Burzynski is not a board s uh certified oncologist 
 It's accurate to say that no trial has been completed and fully published 
 Um, yeah it's um, it it it if, all of the arguing on behalf of Burzynski doesn't give him a single phase 3 
 It doesn't give him um a uh uh of of a completed and and published phase 2 
 Uh, in in in that sense, you know, uh all the the the, you know, kind of back-peddling and and and trying to defend him is is going to, not going to help his case at all_ 
—————————————————————— 
2:03:03 
—————————————————————— 
 You are, honestly as far as I can tell you are doing the um, you know, you 're you're ah throwing up uh, uh, uh, you're giving me another uh invisible dragon in the garage, um 
—————————————————————— 
Well y'all, y'all can call things what y'all want 
 I mean, y'all can give these, fallacy arguments and all that garbage that y'all like, because that's what y'all like to talk about instead of dealing with the issues 
 I mean, Gorski doesn't want to deal with the issues 
—————————————————————— 
 What is the issue were not talking about 
—————————————————————— 
Hey, I've said it to Gorski 
 He liked to back his stuff up on the  Mayo  study, yet he wouldn't, he wouldn't uh debate about the  Mayo  study 
 He likes to say, "Well, Burzynski is not an oncologist," but he won't, say Hey, look at the publications, are any of the guys on the publications oncologists ? 
 We know that Gorski, we know that Burzynski works with oncologists in his practice 
 So, just because Burzynski himself is not an an oncologist, does not necessarily mean anything 
 Do we need to go out, onto PubMed, and, and review every particular person that's published something about cancer and see if they're all oncologists ? 
 Seriously 
—————————————————————— 
2:04:11 
—————————————————————— 
I mean, Gorski will just 
—————————————————————— 
 Yeah, but they 
—————————————————————— 
post a lot of stuff without backing it up 
—————————————————————— 
 But they have track records that support the idea that you should trust them 
—————————————————————— 
Well, (laughing), I, you know, that's up to someone's opinion, considering some of the information that's that the FDA has accepted, as far as giving these guys approval 
—————————————————————— 
_Okay, so 
 What you're telling me is that you trust the FDA to to be able to tell you when he's not doing, good science, but also that you don't trust the FDA 
 Do you see an inherent conflict there ?_ 
—————————————————————— 
How did I say I, I didn't trust them ? 
—————————————————————— 
_Well, when I, whenever I would ask about, like, why would these trials aren 't happening uh and, you know, you say well the the FDA's arranged it 
 The FDA's in control 
 They sign off on these things 
 But they're they're they're they're at the same that they're, they're trustworthy they're also not trustworthy depending on what you need for the particular argument at the time_ 
—————————————————————— 
2:05:12 
—————————————————————— 
Well, I didn't say that they weren't trustworthy, I just raised questions that no one wants to answer about 'em 
—————————————————————— 
_You 're suggesting that they're untrustworthy _ 
—————————————————————— 
No, I'm just sayin' that I've raised questions and none of  The Skeptics  wanna to uh talk about 'em 
—————————————————————— 
_I I would say that the the FDA has given Burzynski every opportunity for decades 
 Every opportunity 
 When he didn't have r r really, he got special treatment as far as I can tell 
 Uh, the, I'm rather stunned every morning I wake up and don't see in the paper, that that place has has been closed down 
 I, I really am 
 Uh, so, you know,that one doesn't really fly with me either 
 Um_ 
—————————————————————— 
2:06:00 
—————————————————————— 
Well, to me the FDA owes Burzynski for a lot of the garbage they pulled off against him (laugh), not to say, you know, they owe him in that way, but they owed him 
—————————————————————— 
_Do you know that the FDA pulled out of the prosecution ? 
 Did you know that the FDA pulled out of the prosecution um of his criminal case, because they were backing a researcher ?_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well, we know a lot stuff they did, but that still doesn't impress me that they pulled out of the prosecution 
 I mean 
—————————————————————— 
_Yeah, the the the it wasn 't the FDA who was pressing charges, it was a Federal prosecutor _ 
—————————————————————— 
Right 
—————————————————————— 
_Right 
 And and, they declined to provide information that the prosecution needed 
 That's important 
 That that that's really important 
 That he has been given the benefit of the doubt, and he has come up wanting, for decades now_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well I find it interesting a lot of this uh, a lot of these letters that were provided between, you know, the government and Burzynski, when the uh phase 2 study was going on, at the behest of the NCI 
 You know, anybody who reads that stuff knows, that when just ignore the person that's been doing, do treating their patients for 20 something years, or close to 20 years, and you change the protocol without his approval, and you don't use the drugs in the manner that he knows works 
—————————————————————— 
_The, no, claims works 
 He claims works_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well, he says they work together and they're not going to work if you don't use them that way 
—————————————————————— 
_One of the things I think 
 One of the things that I think is happening here_ 
—————————————————————— 
(laughing) 
—————————————————————— 
_One of the things I think is happening here, is that lots of people have worked with Burzynski and then have stopped working with B Burzynski 
 Uh, you know, uh lots of uh uh uh these partnerships do not seem to work out in the end 
 I often wonder, if the uh, the way that these things are, are are playing out, because it's s so reliable that they're, that these partnerships are going to fail, I I wonder if th they are designed in such a way, that for instance, um a, uh, a a partner would be uncomfortable working with him_ 
—————————————————————— 
2:08:18 
—————————————————————— 
_Or um or that the specifications for what it takes to enter one of these trials is so high, that nobody will ever enter the trials 
 I mean, I wonder if they are, what, especially, like why hasn't Burzynski left the country ? 
 That's what I want to know_ 
—————————————————————— 
Why would he leave the country ? 
—————————————————————— 
 Exactly 
—————————————————————— 
I think he's made it clear 
—————————————————————— 
 If he was so, if he was s so persecuted and really cares about getting his treatment out to the world, why wouldn 't he ? 
—————————————————————— 
2:09:00 
—————————————————————— 
_They 're, they're lots of things going on here 
 David James has pointed this out, that a lot of questions I'm asking are not going answered 
 "I still don't know how long it would take before you would have any doubts about Burzynski" 
 "I still have no idea, how often we can see patients reporting that signs of getting worse are getting better, before you would change your mind" 
 I've made it very clear that he just needs to have a completed study published and replicated before I support his right to go out and charge people what he's charging for these, for these drugs, and I'm I'm just not seeing that here with you, and I I wonder what could come from, and don't worry I will go to your site and I will comment on on on what you've run 
 Um, but, you know, I I I I it's hard for Skeptics to imagine, what could be gained from engaging with you, if there seems to be no conceivable way, that we can, one, get a straight answer for, how many patients will have to report that getting worse is getting better before you starting doubting your opinion, or, uh, how many uh, uh, how many years does this have to go on before you decide that, "No, we probably just can't produce the goods"_ 
—————————————————————— 
2:10:15 
—————————————————————— 
_One of the interesting things about Doubting Thomas that I think you should definitely consider for yourself, is that at some point, when faced with the real opportunity to prove or disprove his assertions, he doubted himself 
 And that's important 
 And that's where you're falling short in the analogy _ 
—————————————————————— 
Well, I think  The Skeptics  , Skeptics  are falling short because, you know, they don't own up to 
—————————————————————— 
_I 've laid out exactly what it would take for me to turn on a fucking dime 
 I have, I have made it abundantly clear what I need 
 Gorski has made it abundantly clear 
 Everybody else, Guy, and David, and Josephine Jones, uh, the Morgans, all of them have made it abundantly clear, what it would take to change our minds, and you've never done that_ 
—————————————————————— 
2:11:02 
—————————————————————— 
_And even in this, this was an opportunity to do that 
 To come up with a basis for understanding, where it's like, you know what, If we can show this, you know, if we can show a this guy, that, that, there, that his standards are not being met, then, you know, we could possibly have some sort of ongoing dialogue after this_ 
—————————————————————— 
So I can say that since the Mayo Clinic finished their study in 2006, and it took them until 2013, to actually publish it, then I can say, well, Burzynski finished his in 2009, which was 3 years later, which would give Burzynski until 2016 
—————————————————————— 
 Correction: M.D. Anderson 
—————————————————————— 
 Why wasn 't that study 
—————————————————————— 
for me to make up my mind (laughing) 
—————————————————————— 
_Why wasn 't that , that that that, still . . again, it it doesn't seem really to to approach the the the, main question here 
 You know, um . . what are the standards that you have that it isn't, what are your standards to show that it isn't efficacious ?_ 
—————————————————————— 
2:12:05 
—————————————————————— 
Well I can say, well I'm going to have to wait, the same amount of time I had to wait for Mayo to publish their study; which was from 2006 to 2013 
—————————————————————— 
 Clarification: M.D. Anderson 
—————————————————————— 
_Why was the Mayo 
 Why was the Mayo study delayed ?_ 
—————————————————————— 
How do you know it was delayed ? 
—————————————————————— 
_Well you said you had so many years before you finish it and go in 
_ 
—————————————————————— 
I mean, has anybody 
—————————————————————— 
 Why, why did it take so long ? 
—————————————————————— 
done a review of when a clinical trial is studied, and completed, and how long it took the people to publish it ? 
 You know 
 If they could point to me a study that's done that, and say, well here's the high end, here's the low end of the spectrum, here's the middle 
—————————————————————— 
_I have something for you, okay ? 
 Send me that 
 Could you send me that study the way that it was published because um, just just send me the final study, um, to my e-mail address_ 
—————————————————————— 
Sure 
—————————————————————— 
 Um, because, I can ask that question of those researchers, why was this study in this time, and what happened in-between 
—————————————————————— 
2:13:03 
—————————————————————— 
 Why did it take so long for it, for it to come out 
—————————————————————— 
Sure, but that's not gonna, you know like, answer an overall question of, you know, somebody did a comparative study of all clinical trials, and, when they were finished, and at, and when the study was actually published afterwards 
 You know, that's only gonna be one, particular clinical study 
—————————————————————— 
_Right 
 Um, but it it would, perhaps, answer the question; because you're using it as an example on the basis of which to dismiss criticism, whether or not, uh, it is the standard, and therefor you're allowed to accept that Burzynski hasn't published until 2016, or, um, it's an anomaly, which is also a possibility, that most stuff comes out more quickly_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well, we know that the  Declaration of Helsinki  doesn't even give a standard saying, "You must publish within x amount of years," you know ? 
 So, I've yet to find a Skeptic who posted something that said, "Here are the standards, published here" 
—————————————————————— 
2:14:07 
—————————————————————— 
 I I, yeah, the other thing that David James points out is, you know, why 2016 when he 's had 36 years already ? 
—————————————————————— 
Again, we get back to, when the clinical trial is finished, not when Burzynski started 
—————————————————————— 
 Treating people 
—————————————————————— 
I mean, you would expect to find a results to be published after, the final results are in 
—————————————————————— 
 You would expect the Burzynski Patient Group to be a lot bigger after 36 years, and in fact is 
—————————————————————— 
You would expect some people would want to have confidentiality, and maybe not want to be included 
—————————————————————— 
 So, if you 're unsure about this stuff, if you're unsure about the the time to publication, why are you defending it so hard, other than saying, "I don't know, I really need to" 
—————————————————————— 
Why am I unsure ? 
—————————————————————— 
 Uh about the 
—————————————————————— 
(laughing) I just gave you an example 
—————————————————————— 
 The reasons, the reasons for which that he 's, no, why are you defending him so hard, when you're unsure ? 
—————————————————————— 
2:15:02 
—————————————————————— 
Oh, who said I was unsure ? 
 I just gave you an example 
 I mean, I'm just, I believe in free and open debate 
 I mean, I believe, if y'all are gonna spam the Internet, the Internet with garbage that y'all do not back-up, with specific 
—————————————————————— 
 I 've backed-up everything that 
—————————————————————— 
references 
—————————————————————— 
 Every time that I 've tried 
—————————————————————— 
(laughing) 
—————————————————————— 
 and then other people 
—————————————————————— 
Like your tweet that said uh, "antineoplastons is uron, is Unicorn pee," right ? 
—————————————————————— 
_Way back 
 It is about_ 
—————————————————————— 
(laughing) 
—————————————————————— 
_It is about as efficacious 
 We have the same_ 
—————————————————————— 
"Burzynski is a vampire" 
 Good one (laughing) 
—————————————————————— 
 Yeah, I 've, and and I based that on a a a that type of thing 
—————————————————————— 
He sucks their blood out of 'em right ? 
 Yeah (laughing) 
 Humor 
 Okay, I understand humor 
—————————————————————— 
 You, you, you can read that how you want, right ? 
—————————————————————— 
(laughing) 
—————————————————————— 
_There 
 He does have the accent though_ 
 Right ? 
 No (laugh)_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well, that's because he's Polish 
—————————————————————— 
_(laughing) 
 Alright ? 
 No, but listen, like, it it it's not, it, we we don't understand why you defend himself so hard, when there is such a paucity of of of information out there 
 Um_ 
—————————————————————— 
2:16:09 
—————————————————————— 
What I defend, is that, y'all post stuff, a lot of Skeptics post stuff, including Gorski, and they do not back it up, with references, citations, or links 
 Gorski will just post stuff, like he did about saying, you know, the FDA would not approve, uh, accelerated approval, without a final phase 2 clinical trial being published, which was an incorrect statement, he did not provide any link 
—————————————————————— 
 Even if it 's true or false you, honestly though 
—————————————————————— 
We know it's false 
—————————————————————— 
_Even if it 's true or false, in in that particular instance, you know, eh let's just say that you're right 
 Gorski gets that point completely wrong 
 It has no bearing on whether or not, ANP works_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well, I'm just 
—————————————————————— 
 That 's a  Red Herring 
—————————————————————— 
I'm just 
—————————————————————— 
 You 're just focusing on this, on this little niggly stuff, where the real question, is does it work ? 
—————————————————————— 
Not 
—————————————————————— 
 Are patients getting better at a better rate then not 
—————————————————————— 
2:17:01 
—————————————————————— 
That's 
—————————————————————— 
 or otherwise ? 
—————————————————————— 
Well, that is just lame 
—————————————————————— 
Y'all, Skeptics, like to sh spam Twitter, and social media, with all this negative stuff about Burzynski, but then when I ask you to back it up, you can't back it up, and then, and then on this conversation you want to come down and pinhole it, to a specific subject, you know, the nitty-gritty 
 Well, if y'all were only debating the nitty-gritty, we would only be d debating the nitty-gritty, but that's not what y'all do 
—————————————————————— 
 We 're were talking about whether or not there's evidence to suggest it works 
—————————————————————— 
Well, we know the FDA's said there is 
—————————————————————— 
_The FDA, see that 's the thing 
 You, the FDA are are, you know, you invest them with, we're just, we're just circling around again_ 
—————————————————————— 
(laughing) 
—————————————————————— 
_Uh um, alright 
 Well, this has gone on for rather a, longer than I thought it would_ 
—————————————————————— 
2:18:00 
—————————————————————— 
_Um, I, uh, wanna thank you for coming on here 
 I wasn't sure that you would actually do it 
 Um, I'm glad that you did 
 I'm glad that we talked 
 Um,  I will look at your web-site, and  we will, uh, we, uh, you, oh  make sure that I I go to your blog and and I talk there 
 Um_ 
—————————————————————— 
And I'll give you those links that I told you I would give you 
—————————————————————— 
 Please do 
 And I will look at those 
 Maybe not in the next few days; I've got a lot going on but_ 
—————————————————————— 
Yeah, that's fine 
—————————————————————— 
_Alright 
 Um_ 
—————————————————————— 
Well, I thought it was productive too 
 You know, I don't see why Gorski is afraid of debating issues 
—————————————————————— 
 I don 't think he is 
—————————————————————— 
on the Internet, on his blog 
—————————————————————— 
_I don 't think he's afraid 
 I just think he's got a lot going on 
 He is act, a full-time surgical oncologist and researcher 
 He does have insane am, he has to pick and choose his battles 
 And if, if if he saw that we were going to ultimately be circling around our same arguments again and again; kind of like we've done here, um, he uh, you, he doesn't have time for that, I don't think_ 
—————————————————————— 
2:19:00 
—————————————————————— 
 I mean 
—————————————————————— 
Hey, he has time to post about, "Hey, uh, Burzynski got a Catholic award from somebody," which, has nothing to do with antineoplastons, whatsoever 
 So, you know, he's not focusing just in on, "Do antineoplastons work, yes or no?," "When will Burzynski publish ?," yes or no ? 
 You know, he's putting all this ridiculous side junk, you know 
 So, I am not going to take that seriously 
—————————————————————— 
_Alright 
 I I would ask that you to to go back over The The Other Burzynski Patient Group and take their stories seriously, because they deserve at least the same amount of consideration that the survivors do 
 That's my_ 
—————————————————————— 
Exactly 
—————————————————————— 
_That 's my kids, okay 
 Well, Thanks for much for talking 
 I greatly appreciate it_ 
—————————————————————— 
You bet 
 Thank you 
—————————————————————— 
_Alright 
 Take it easy_
——————————————————————
You too
