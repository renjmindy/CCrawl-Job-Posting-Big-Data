 Okay 
 Hot Damn! it's a Full-time job 
 If we were bragging we'd say, “Come join this growing independent branding agency and talented AF group of people with an awesome CCO who's raising the creative bar and is looking for folks to join the advenure" but bragging isn't our thing, so we'll just say, “McGarrah Jessee in Austin, TX, USA is hiring a Senior Art Director and Senior Copywriter Team." 
 About 
 With the world the way it is, we don't necessarily need folks to be in Austin. So that's exciting. 
 If you're a solid team that's been working together for a minute or if you are looking solo we'd love to hear from you. 
 We're a staunchly independent creative agency in a pivotal moment with a new leadership team who's supported by our founders. You'll be working across our brand roster and new business opportunities. Current clients include Lyft, Whataburger, GameStop, Frost Bank, Case Knives + Zippo, and Costa Sunglasses. 
 We're evolving and growing as an agency. Not in numbers per se but in brand partnerships and the types of work we do. It's pretty exciting time to join the agency if you ask us!
