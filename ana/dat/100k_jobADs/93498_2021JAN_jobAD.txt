 How to find a job with social media 
 01/05/2014BY: Tracey Mesken 
 ​When looking for new employment opportunities, don’t just stick to relying on job boards or employer or recruitment websites. Given the time and money companies are now investing in building and engaging their online community, it’s probably time to expand your search channels to include social media. 
 So as to not miss a job prospect, here are some of the ways you can start integrating different social media platforms into your job search. 
 Twitter 
 Twitter is a widely used medium for companies to push out messages in real time.  Whilst it is general news and updates, it often includes job vacancies. Some companies may even have their own dedicated careers Twitter feed. 
 If you are new to the world of tweeting, have no fear as it is easy to set up and get started. Once you are set to go, opt to follow a variety of different kinds of users/employers related to your industry of interest. For example, you could follow WorkPac ( @workpac ) for our latest positions and job search tips. 
 Twitter is also a great source for staying up-to-date with industry news, job positions and networking events, all of which will appear in your news feed based on the companies and organisations you are following. 
 And unless you have been living under a rock for the past year, you may have heard of hash tags. These are terms that are used for search, for example #miningjobs or #employment. By searching some relevant terms you will find users to follow that suit the information you are seeking. 
 Facebook 
 These days most employers have a company page on Facebook that can easily be found through a quick search. Find and like the Facebook pages of all the key companies that interest you, and keep an eye out for posts about current vacancies and industry news.  WorkPac's Facebook group is a great place to start, as it can link you to a range of other companies and professional groups. 
 Be mindful though that unless you want to ruin your chances of potential employment, be sure not to publicly post offensive comments on the company page. Comments associated with frustration in your job search is one thing, derogatory comments is another. The best course of action if you wish to make contact is via private message. 
 Also making a few small changes to your existing Facebook profile can help you search for jobs, and even be directly targeted with relevant positions. It is harder and harder for companies to reach existing and potential followers through organic reach so paid targeted advertising is now becoming the norm. 
 Employers often target their job ads and job related messages based on candidates qualifications, previous jobs and interests as listed in their profiles, so the first step is to try and fill out key information about your professional history on your Facebook profile, under the ‘Work and Education’ section. 
 LinkedIn 
 It may be the top white collar social networking site in Australia, but it shouldn’t be discounted for blue collar roles as this is a rapidly growing user base; and where there is a significant user base there are employers. LinkedIn is not only the best platform to showcase your own skills and qualifications to recruiters, but is also a great place to research potential employers and their job opportunities. 
 The first step is to set up a quality LinkedIn profile with detailed information about your qualifications and previous experiences. As with other social media, LinkedIn allows you to search and join company groups related to mining and construction. Follow recruitment companies such as  WorkPac  and other organisations with ties to the Australian mining industry to keep your finger on the pulse and get your name into the right networking circles. 
 You can also find and directly apply to a range of jobs through LinkedIn’s job search function. To ensure that you don’t miss any potential opportunities, subscribe to receive regular updates from LinkedIn about recently advertised jobs in your area. 
 Lastly, employers often undertake proactive candidate sourcing activities where they search for users who meet a skill set and make direct contact. So if you aren’t there, you’re missing a chance to promote yourself. 
 Social media can be daunting and seemingly time consuming but it isn’t going anywhere.  Invest a little time into setting up your social profiles properly, engage with the right companies and groups and check in regularly for updates. Your social media networks are a great place to source not just jobs, but also information on career tips, industry news and events.
