 Coach Profile 
 Kathleen Zwarick Shanley, PhD, CAE, ACC 
 How will clients benefit with you as their coach? 
 Clients will be set up for "success" feeling fulfilled, engaged, heard, and connected. They will develop measurable results and begin to see them with each session. 
 What results have clients reported after working with you? 
 Testimonials are available here: www.think-statice.com. In addition to those, clients have reported that I helped them discover where and when they were making up stories in their head that may negatively impact their leadership ability and did so while making it enjoyable and fun. They report they feel inspired, acknowledged, and validated. 
 Here's a sample testimonial: "As a new leader on an established executive team I was in search of perspective, renewed focus and an opportunity to work more closely with my teams to meet our goals. I interviewed three coaches and Kathy's coaching strategies were most in line with my priorities and she listened to what I was looking for. Within 6 weeks of working with Kathy my focus changed from self- doubt to positive self-awareness and focus. Kathy continued to push me to harness my positive energy and use it to support my team and myself. I now approach work and life with a renewed motivation and focus. Her ability to push my thinking and help me work past mental barriers has changed the way I consider problems and work through them. It has also helped me speak with my team as they become challenged in achieving their goals. In just a short time I was able to take frustrations in my lack of forward momentum to leading a large team through a challenging project with energy and action. As Kathy said multiple times, 'trust the process'. I did and have the utmost respect for Kathy's approach, her candor and support for my continued professional growth and success." 
 What do clients say about working with you? 
 "Kathy partnered with me to coach a team of three managers during a six-month period. Using tools including a 360 assessment and the Energy Leadership Index, each team member identified key areas of development: 1) creating synergy among and across teams; 2) discovering areas that may negatively, and positively, impact their ability to lead, understand and navigate difficult conversations; and 3) managing conflict. Kathy provided exceptional value to the team. Her coaching accomplished our goals to groom our future business leaders and arm them with effective leadership and communication strategies." Bill H., COO and Director of Innovation, major imaging software and research company, Parsippany, New Jersey 
 "From our first meeting, Kathy really made me think about what it was I wanted to do, helping me focus on the things that really mattered to me, and how I could achieve them. The sessions reignited a dwindling self-belief and inspired me to get back on track and figure out what I really wanted. She helped me to focus and organize my thoughts as well as re-evaluate what was important to me and whether I was willing to make the sacrifices needed to achieve what I wished to do with my working life. 
 I had the drive and the determination; I just couldn't see where I was going wrong. I was so frustrated at my lack of progress. I couldn't see any other way of doing things. With her help, I actually came away with a totally new way of looking at my life. It was as if I had all the answers I just wasn't able to find them myself. I cannot thank Kathy enough for helping me see what was important, and for giving me back the self-assurance that I had hiding in me. I don't think she even realizes such an important role she was in helping me make my decisions for the future." 
 N. Graham, Association Client & Now Small Business Owner, Alabama 
 "Kathy Zwarick gets my highest recommendation as an executive coach. Her unique ability to recognize, understand, and explain complex business relationships has excelled my thinking, and most importantly, my actions. Along the way there have been surprising (and sometimes painful) personal realizations, but Kathy's coaching continued to make me a better person every day, both at work and at home. Kathy did not hesitate to tactfully, but directly point out areas that needed to be considered a different way, and proved to be right with her observations, opinions, and suggestions. Kathy is not only challenging and insightful, but also patient and understanding, with good instincts and knowledge. With the coaching experience, I truly believe I have improved my leadership style." 
 Larry Fuhrmann, COO, R.S. Crum & Company, Mountainside, NJ 
 "My new position as senior director was exciting but sometimes challenging and overwhelming. Kathy was a tremendous help in getting me to set appropriate priorities and improve my leadership style. Her suggestions were always on point, as were her instincts. Kathy's extensive experience is evident in her delivery and style, as well as extremely constructive. Her coaching style is not only very positive but also tactful and practical. I have absolutely no hesitation in giving Kathy my strongest endorsement as an executive coach." 
 Association Client, Washington, DC 
 "Kathy Zwarick is an outstanding executive coach. Kathy and I worked together on specific leadership and communication behaviors that have allowed me to become much more effective in my role. The tools and methodology that Kathy uses are both tailored and insightful. She has a terrific way of gently pointing out both the areas where I excel and where there's room for improvement. She isn't prescriptive, but rather asks open ended questions that lead you to recognize the right path. She's personable, easy to work with and also has a great grasp of what's necessary to navigate in today's complex business world." 
 Stephanie Colotti, Director, Business Operations, Madison, WI area
