The Liberal Doomsayer

 About 
 
 Carly Fiorina, The Job Killer 
 And if you think that, when push comes to shove, she's all that different from any other Repug, you are utterly deluding yourself. 
 (And by the way, I am not including this video to beat up people of other nationalities. I would only say, though, that if someone's job in this country is outsourced/offshored for good, it should be replaced by something of comparable worth - a quaint notion, I realize, but one that has been sold to us by all of those "free" trade advocates…as I've said before, I have yet to see an example of "free" trade actually creating a job in this country from another location as opposed to the other way around.)
