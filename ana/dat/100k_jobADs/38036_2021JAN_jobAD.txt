 About Louisiana Center for Children's Rights 
 The Louisiana Center for Childrenâ€™s Rights (LCCR) is a nonprofit law office that fights to keep children of out the justice system so that they can thrive in their homes and communities. We stand up for kids in the courtroom, support them in schools, and advocate for them in the halls of government. With our unique blend of direct representation and policy advocacy, we address both the individual and systemic issues that trap mainly poor, Black children in the justice system.
