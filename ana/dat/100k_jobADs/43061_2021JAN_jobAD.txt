 Graton Resort And Casino to hold jobs fair 
 __ Adam Morgan 
 __ August 4, 2016 
 __ Latest Casino and Gambling News ,  Tribal Gaming ,  Casino expansion projects ,  California ,  Employment & Careers 
 In  California , the federally-recognized  Federated Indians Of Graton Rancheria  has announced that it will be holding a jobs fair on Saturday morning in hopes of filling some 300 new positions at its soon to be expanded  Graton Resort And Casino . 
 According to a report from The North Bay Business Journal, the tribe is spending around $175 million to build a new six-story extension to its facility near the city of Rohnert Park and requires employees to fill jobs in areas including gaming, food and beverage, hotel operations and guest services. 
 The 342,000 sq ft expansion to the Sonoma County facility is expected to open on November 15 complete with a 10,000 sq ft spa and fitness center along with an outdoor resort-style pool area and 20,000 sq ft of additional convention and meeting space for dinners, shows and special events. 
 For those interested in working as a card dealer in the expanded facility, the Federated Indians Of Graton Rancheria revealed that it will moreover run a free tutorial program beginning from September 6 with further details available at the coming jobs fair. 
 The $825 million first stage of the northern California property, which is operated by  Las Vegas -based  Station Casinos , opened in late-2013 featuring thousands of slot and table games as well as an 8,700 sq ft events center and a dozen restaurants. It already ranked as one of the state’s five largest casinos before  breaking ground on the extension in September  and currently employs approximately 1,500 people. 
 The coming expansion, which is being built with the assistance of some 100 local companies, will see the facility add 500 sq ft standard hotel rooms as well as suites as large as 2,600 sq ft. Joe Hasson, General Manager and Casino Vice-President for the Graton Resort And Casino, previously revealed that he hopes to gain  four-star status  for the new project.
