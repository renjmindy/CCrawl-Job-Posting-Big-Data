 7 tips for managing stress while job hunting in a pandemic 
 Looking for a job is stressful. Looking for a job in the middle of a global pandemic sometimes feels impossible. That's a normal reaction to these abnormal times. But there are ways to help  cope with stress . 
 **1) Take a break from the news.  ** 
 It's no secret that too much time reading the news can increase feelings of stress these days. There's even a name for that feeling: " headline stress disorder" . So put down your phone, turn off the TV, and take a break from the news, even just for a few hours. 
 **2) Know the facts.  ** 
 Understanding  basic facts  about how the coronavirus is transmitted and ways to protect yourself can reduce your stress and empower you to make smart decisions that limit your risk. 
 This also goes for your job hunt. Stay safe during your job hunt by understanding: your risk factors, what employers should be doing to keep workers safe, and also which industrial jobs put you at higher risk of contagion. 
 **3) Take care of your body.  ** 
 Finding time to exercise or cook healthy meals can feel like a lot to deal with at times. Just do your best to take care of yourself. Here's a few ideas to get started: 
 
 Take deep breaths, stretch, or  meditate  (don't know how? There's an  app  for that) 
 Try to  eat healthy , well-balanced meals 
 Exercise regularly 
 Get plenty of sleep 
 Avoid alcohol and drugs 
 
 4) Make time to unwind. 
 It's often hard to break cycles of stress and anxiety, especially when we're cooped up at home. Try to make time every day for an activity you enjoy. Read a book, go for a walk around the block, or get a coloring book (seriously, they  reduce stress ). 
 **5) Take control of your job search.  **

 **6) Connect with others.  ** 
 These days, connection looks different for everyone. Sometimes it's talking to your spouse or family. Or it might be a video call with a friend. But it's important to talk with people you trust about your concerns and how you are feeling. 
 **7) Get help.  ** 
 If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:
