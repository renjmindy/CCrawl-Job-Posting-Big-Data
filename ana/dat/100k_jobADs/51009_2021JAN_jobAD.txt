 Solve interesting problems facing a data retention and search SaaS product operating at a large scale. 
 Role overview 
 REMOTE | US-ONLY | SENIOR | CLOJURE or equivalent 
 Looking for a senior/principal engineer to join our distributed team working on an enterprise-class SaaS application for data archiving and search running in multiple public clouds for thousands of customers. 
 Youâ€™ll be working in Clojure on our backend, but branching out into other areas of the stack is possible if youâ€™re interested. 
 Tech Stack: 
 Frontend: React/Redux/Javascript/ES6/SCSS 
 Backend: Clojure/Elasticsearch/Postges/RabbitMQ/Kafka/ZooKeeper 
 Modern CI/CD: Kubernetes, Docker, Chef, Sensu configured and deployed programmatically to multiple public clouds 
 â€¢ Solve important scaling problems around processing of huge volumes of data in near real-time and features atop petabytes of data under management. â€¢ Introduce security features. â€¢ Adapt data ingestion to incorporate new types of unstructured content, like from Slack. â€¢ Drive design, implementation, and review of major areas of the codebase, new features and next generation architecture. â€¢ Contribute to a team that values code quality, innovative thinking, good communication, occasional pair programming, sound testing practices, and opportunities for mentoring. 
 Developed at Sonian and acquired by Barracuda in 2017. Weâ€™ve been working well in remote teams for almost 10 years. In 2019 Barracuda is doing some interesting things in the security space, and weâ€™d love for you to join us. 
 I'm happy to answer questions about the product, its target market and business goals - as well as any questions about the position, our engineering culture and dev processes, or how you'd be spending your days. I'm the hiring manager and look forward to speaking with you.
