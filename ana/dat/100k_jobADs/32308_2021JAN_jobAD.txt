 2017 Game Review Haiku, #5 – BackDoor Door 2: The Job 
 Posted on  January 9, 2017  |  1 Comment 
 Left moon for city 
Robots here, phone says find Aert 
That's your job, human

 I can’t believe I’m still doing this. I can’t believe I’ll ever stop. These game summaries in chunks of five, seven, and five syllable lines paint pictures in the mind better than any half a dozen descriptive paragraphs I could ever write. Trust me, I’ve tried. Brevity is the place to be. At this point, I’ve done over 200 of these things and have no plans of slowing down. So get ready for another year of haikus. Doumo arigatou gozaimasu.
