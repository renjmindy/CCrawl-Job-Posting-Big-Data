 Apple falters because of Steve Jobs top-down management style 
 Posted:  July 22, 2010 |  Author:   workplacedemocracy  |  Filed under:   Democratic Companies ,  workplace democracy  |  Tags:   Steve Jobs Apple iPhone 4 antenna reception problems  | Leave a comment 
 Apple Inc.  has been receiving a lot of negative publicity about the iPhone 4's antenna reception problems following the device's launch on June 24. 
 In a surprising development, the Wall Street Journal  reported  that "Apple engineers were aware of the risks associated with the new antenna design as early as a year ago, but Chief Executive Steve Jobs liked the design so much that Apple went ahead with its development, said another person familiar with the matter." 
 Steve Jobs has been described as a  cruel and manipulative  manager who, as Forbes  reported , "periodically reduces subordinates to tears, and fires employees in angry tantrums," and Apple is known for its top-down, hierarchical structure. 
 It's hard to imagine problems like this, which were previously known within the organization but not solved because employees feared or were intimidated by the CEO, occurring at decentralized, democratically-run companies.
