 Here at Gousto, we are on a mission to become the UK's favourite way to eat dinner! 
 Delicious recipes, precise ingredients & a dollop of adventure, delivered to your door. We have invested into our technology, data capability and our product to ensure the customer is at the heart of what we do. Every aspect of our business is powered by our passion. 
 Whether it is innovation through our recipe development, building algorithms to optimise our recipe box journey or devising strategies to reduce plastic and food waste. All our teams play a part in our amazing growth in the UK! 
 Our DREAM? To be the most-loved way to eat dinner, and for every meal to leave the planet better off. Gousto is changing how people shop, cook and eat food at home. It’s an incredibly exciting time to join our team! 
 Senior Product Analyst (Menu Tribe) 
 We are investing in analytics, and you will help shape the vision, process and structure for how we grow to help Gousto make better decisions, faster by gaining insight from our digital data. 
 What you'll do 
 As Senior Product Analyst for our Menu tribe you will be pivotal to ensuring our menu optimisation and marketplace continue to scale. This role is diverse, it ranges from doing data modelling and behavioural analysis, to working closely with Product Managers and Developers as part of both Discovery and Delivery. 
 With millions of rows of data behind you, you’ve got an opportunity to have a big impact on the business. 
 For example, you may discover new insight which leads to a bold new hypothesis, then working with Product Managers to put this theory into action with experimentation in our App, and then subsequently provide analysis on test significance, selection bias and roadmaps. You will recommend next steps based on the insight you have gathered and suggest improvements to further optimise. 
 And last but not least, you’ll be a part of ensuring Gousto becomes even more data driven as we grow. Using your vast knowledge around data you’ll work alongside developers to ensure data is tracked in a way that it is scalable for our reporting tools and is in the simplest format for insights to make sure data and analysis are at the heart of decision-making. 
 WHO YOU ARE 
 You have strong analytical skills, great judgement, attention to detail, love solving problems and finding insight. 
 You understand statistics and behavioural data and can combine them to tell a compelling story which you effectively communicate to peers, C-Level and any other area of Gousto. 
 We are growing our analytics capabilities, helping define, shape and lead the future of Analytics at Gousto excites you rather than scares you! You are realistic and proactive, you operate a flexible system that can react quickly to changes. You don’t want to be told what to do, you identify the opportunities to raise the bar for analytics, but also for how we make decisions across Gousto. 
 What’s it like working at Gousto? 
 All of us are responsible for the success of Gousto. Our guiding values - dream, deliver and care - show our commitment to innovation, our ambition to hit goals at speed, and our deep respect for the people we work with.
