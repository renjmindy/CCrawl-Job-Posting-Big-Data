  iPhone App Tracks Path to Career Success...One Hour at a Time!  
 Work It Daily 
 October 08, 2009 
 By J.T. O'Donnell This week on C-REAL-TV, I interviewed Ray Wenderlich, an  iPhone App developer  who took what he learned from  The 10,000 Rule article  to a whole new level. Ray became inspired when he realized virtually anyone can become an expert - no talent required. You just need to amass enough hours of learning and experience (i.e. Tiger Woods, Bill Gates). But, then he wondered... _  how do you track that? _ Three weeks ago, Ray sent me an e-mail letting me know our post was the catalyst for him to develop,  LevelMeUp  - an iPhone app that literally tracks your hours on the road to being an expert in your field. Imagine how exciting it was to learn just one article had made such an impact on a reader - so much so, that he built a career tool for others! And in case you are wondering, we are not getting paid to promote Ray's app or taking any kind of commission on sales through links on this site. There's no compensation involved. We're simply blown-away impressed by his desire to create a solution like this and had to share it with readers. In the interview above, you'll hear Ray explain: 1) Why having a tool to track your hours can motivate you improve, just like advancing levels in a video game. 2) How tracking hours can help you feel more in control and optimistic about your ability to become an expert. 3) How you may be racking up hours and not even realizing it! Ray's already gotten some excellent feedback from folks using the LevelMeUp app and hopes to add even greater functionality soon. I can't stress enough what a great example Ray is of what it takes to brand yourself as an expert. His proactive decision to design a solution says a lot about him as an employee, don't you agree? I hope everyone takes a minute to hear his story and then checks out his useful app. Why not start tracking your own hours on LevelMeUp and let us know how you are doing? Ray, congrats again on an app well-done. I'm pretty sure Malcolm Gladwell would agree...you are proof his  10,000 Hour Rule  works!  You can checkout Ray Wenderlich's app at the LevelMeUp website...  Or, download it from the  iPhone App Store...
