 Useful English: how to succeed in a job interview 
 April 16, 2014  |  Deb 
 If you have  a   job interview in English  lined up, you might want to give this post a read. I'm going to present some language that you can use to answer the most common questions  interviewers  usually ask. 
 As an  interviewee  , you're likely to be asked the four following questions: 
 What are your strengths? 
 Here are some expressions/words that you might want to use to address this question: 
 
 I 'm good at + doing something : I'm good at planning /  dealing with  people; 
 I 'm good with + something : I'm good with numbers; 
 People say I 'm.. : people say I'm very hard-working; 
 I 've often been praised for + skills / doing something : I've often been praised for my organisational skills / being always on time; 
 My  time management  is excellent; 
 I'm  reliable  ; 
 to cope with something  : I can cope with stressful situations; 
 to strive + to do something  : I always strive to meet deadlines / achieve my goals; 
 I 'm particularly proud of + skills : I'm particularly proud of my ability to deal with multiple tasks; 
 
 What are your weaknesses? 
 
 I find it difficult + to-infinitive:  I find it difficult to say 'no'; 
 I  struggle with + someone/ something / doing something:  I  sometimes  struggle with people who don't work hard / prioritising; 
 I  have trouble + doing something:  I  occasionally  have trouble **** prioritising tasks; 
 I used to + infinitive but now:  I used to  have difficulties in  prioritising* but I have now learnt ..; 
 
 > >>  I'd suggest that you use adverbs like 'sometimes' or 'occasionally' in your response to make your answer sound 'less negative'. Also by using '  I used to + infinitive  ' you're underlining that you've worked on your weakness and finally overcome it. 
 *Notice the structure: to have difficulties in + do  ing  something. 
 Tell me about your experience/ your current job. 
 
 to be in charge of: a  s a  Sales Director, I'm in charge of strategic planning; 
 to be responsible for  : as a Sales Director, I'm responsible for strategic planning; 
 to lead a team:  I lead a team of five people; 
 my main duties include + (doing) something:  my main duties include strategic planning and setting targets etc; 
 my field is  + sector/ science / industry: my field is human resource / psychology ..; 
 
 What made you apply for this job? 
 
 I think this job is a  perfect match for my skills 
 I think this job would  suit me  becauseâ€¦ 
 I want to  bring my career to the next level 
 I think it would be both  challenging  and  rewarding 
 My aim is to become XXXX in five years time; 
 I 'd like to  move on in my career  as a Sales Director and this looks like an excellent opportunity; 
 
 Grammar you need to revise 
 Make sure you revise the following grammar before your interview: 
 
 Present Perfect  : I have worked in my current job  for  12 years /  since  2002*; 
 Past Simple  : I worked for 5 years in marketing before starting working for XXX; 
 Present Perfect Continuous  : (lately) I have been working on a very important project..; 
 2nd Conditional  : If I was offered the job, I'd be able to start in a month (using the 2nd conditional makes you sound less pretentious ðŸ™‚ 
 
 *for+ period of time (two days, three months, five hours) 
since+ point in time (2010, April, Tuesday, five o'clock) 
 Hope this helps and good luck ðŸ™‚
