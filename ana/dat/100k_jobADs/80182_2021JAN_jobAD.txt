  Beware: The #1 Myth About Getting Your Dream Job  
 Ryan Niessen 
 July 10, 2014 
 My friend Sean had a dream. He dreamed of getting paid well to do something he loved for a company that was making a profit, as well as a difference in the world.  Related: This Theory Of Awesomeness Leads To Your Dream Job  He wanted a fun work environment with people like him, and  he knew his dream was possible  because he had several role models who had already achieved it. (Note: Read to the bottom to find a free resource that’ll help you achieve your dream) 
 
 The Giant Myth 
 But there was one thing holding Sean back. A myth - ingrained in him from an early age - that said he didn’t have enough experience, and therefore couldn’t do it. Sean believed this myth so much that he didn’t even try to get his dream job. He figured that it would never happen - so why bother? 
 The “Normal” Result 
 So, what happened to Sean? Nothing. He got a different, “normal job” that paid the bills and he didn’t hate it  too much.  He started a family he loved, and worked every day of his career as a pretty happy guy - though he always had in the back of his mind the question… What if? 
 The Cost Of Settling 
 One day, when Sean was just a week away from retiring, he was sitting on his porch scanning the Internet, and he came across this quote: 
 
 “Hell would be if God were to show me things I could have accomplished if only I had believed in myself.” 
 - Unknown Author (that one) 
 
 It really struck a chord with him. Sean sat there and reflected on the idea - and noticed it bringing up the old feelings he had whenever he wondered what could have been… Finally facing them, Sean realized with sadness that he missed his opportunity years ago. However, being just one week away from retirement, he quickly saw a new door opening that would allow him to finally pursue what he loves, and make the difference in the world he envisioned. Within a minute, Sean decided. He was going to retire, and immediately start learning how to become a public speaker. He always had a passion for moving people with his words, and he wouldn’t let his true dream slip away another day. 
 How To Achieve Your Dream As Soon As Possible

We’ve all compromised at some point in our lives, but the good news is that we’re always given another opportunity to seize the day. So, no matter where you are in life right now, if you know in your heart that you’re capable of more... that you deserve your  dream job  and an awesome life… Then seize the day, and have the courage to take the next step towards that life, today. Now, I’m so passionate about this message that I decided to give you a  free resource that’ll help you take that next step towards your dream.  It’s a  free video  sharing three solid tips you can apply today to get your dream job, and it shares the wisdom of my mentor, who helped me get my dream job years ago.
