 The only secure job in this White House is slate cleaner 
 From  BUSINESS INSIDER  : 
 
 President Donald Trump on Monday removed Anthony Scaramucci as the White House communications director after he had served in the role for 10 days,  The New York Times  and other outlets reported. 
 The decision came at the urging of the new White House chief of staff, John Kelly, The Times reported, adding that it was unclear whether Scaramucci would leave the White House or remain employed in another capacity. 
 
 Original DVD cover 
 
 "Anthony Scaramucci will be leaving his role as White House communications director," White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. "Mr. Scaramucci felt it was best to give chief of staff John Kelly a clean slate and the ability to build his own team. We wish him all the best." 
 Kelly talked to Scaramucci shortly after taking the oath of office and informed the communications director that he was being removed from his post, Wall Street Journal reporter Michael Bender  said on Twitter . Scaramucci had told Kelly that he reported directly to the president, to which Kelly said he was "gone,"  a source told  April Ryan, the White House correspondent for American Urban Radio Networks. 
 Meanwhile,  multiple outlets  reported  that Scaramucci was  escorted from White House grounds after his ouster. 
 Scaramucci made waves when he  unloaded on Reince Priebus , then the chief of staff, to Ryan Lizza, a New Yorker reporter, who published the tirade on Thursday. On Friday, Priebus was out, and Trump announced Kelly as his replacement. 
 â€¦snipâ€¦ 
 In addition to Priebus, Sean Spicer and Michael Short also resigned during Scaramucci's tenure â€” Spicer as the White House press secretary and Short as a press aide. 
 â€¦snipâ€¦ 
 Benjy Sarlin of NBC News noted  that President Ronald Reagan had a communications director who served for nearly as long. That communications director, John Koehler,  resigned after it became public  that he was in a Nazi youth organization when he was 10.

 The looks like another one of Bannon's Greasy Oily Films to me. He's still there after being the target of Scaramucci's choicest vulgarity. 
 So let me get this straight -- Scaramucci gets hired, sticks around just long enough to drive Spicer and Priebus out the door, and then gets fired himself? Who's next? 
 To hell with it. I should have stuck to blogging about architecture and termite digestion. Nobody can keep up with this crap.

 I'm not convinced that Kelly would conspire with the likes of Bannon. I'm no fan of Kelly, but I think he is decent enough to realize that the communications director of the White House can't go around talking about staffers self-fellating. I think this was all Kelly.I don't think Bannon was behind Reincy and Spicey getting fired either. That was all Twitler and Mini-Mooch. 
 I am going to get one of those big popcorn machines to put by the TV set.

 Just remember, whatever the T does, there is always a record of him making fun of himself on Twitter:

 Hi Eddie! 
 He constantly contradicts everything he has said before, and his base still believes everything he says. Just waiting for one of the people he treated like shit to testify before a Grand Jury and/or write a tell-all book.

 Hee hee, this is more fun than any movie or comedy routine on TV. You have to wonder who will be next. I am sort of proud- that is a stretch, by the way, of Model T for not getting in the way of Kelly so that Scaramucci could be removed. The man was clearly a liability with his foul mouth and brazen manner. Never saw anything like it in my eighty years. Now somebody needs to put the skids to Bannon.

 Twitler is a pussy (he should grab himself) who would never stand up to a general. He only intimidates little weaselly men like Reincy and Spicey and, of course, women. Not strong women, like Angela Merkel or Hillary, just the ones too scared to stand up to him.

 Mine, too, my dear Eleanor, but only from lack of oxygen, because I haven't been able to catch my breath while laughing at Mooch's fate all day! ðŸ˜†

 That's their aim. Keep our heads spinning while they get away with whatever crime they've committed/are committing.

 Foxy! Long time, no see! ðŸ˜€ 
 I wouldn't give this White House too much credit for planning anything. They throw shit at the walls and sees what sticks. Yes, they are doing all kinds of shady crap, but the chaos is coincidental, not some grand scheme. Though some of them might be smarter and diabolical, Twitler is an idiot, and he screws up everyone's plans.

 Hey, nonnie9999! My, you do have a good memory! I haven't been here since Bush years. Ahhh, the good ol' days of Alberto Gonzalez, Cheney and all else we thought was the worst that would ever happen to this country. Now, we have even poopier poop show in the White House. I had to come back here for your hilarious photoshops and snarky commentary. ðŸ˜€ missed ya!

 How could I possibly forget a name like Foxy-contin? So glad to see you back here. Hope you stop by often like in the good old days. How depressing is that-Chimpy and the gang being the good old days? Never thought I'd mss Gonzo, Deadeye Dick (okay, I still don't miss  him  ), Bubbles, Condi, Rummy, etc.? ðŸ˜¥

 i keep reading how twitler uses chaos as one of the tools in his tool box. i couldn't disagree more as twitler has no tool box & he's not smart enough to use chaos as a strategy. chaos is the consequence of his stunted emotional behavior & his inexperience. too many people give him way too much credit.

 Loony, 'zactly what I've been saying all along. There are some Machiavellian people in the White House, but Twitler undermines their evil plans every day just by being a moronic asshole who can never be a team player. 
 My sister and I have a running joke. When one of the dogs is doing something already (like lying down), I will point at him/her and say, "Lie down, good puppy!" This is what's going on with Twitler. He does something, and everyone else has to retrofit their comments to make it seem like what he did was the plan all along so they can make believe he's some kind of fucking genius.
