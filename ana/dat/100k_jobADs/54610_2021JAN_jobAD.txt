 8 facts about me (for March!)

 Yes! It's has been a while! How are you, dears? 
 Today I am back for a short brief about other facts in my life. I do not know why but most of the time, at the end of every month I remember about this post most. For all the troubles and issues I have had during the whole 30 days, i just want to get rid of them as soon as possible and have no fancy mentioning about them at all. Let's keep our life positive! 
 Here we go! 
 
 
 I work in the area of giving people, or human, information. 
 
 
 I have good memory and normally I prefer to remember good things about people. 
 
 
 If you see me, your first impression about me would be a cold person but actually I am an ice-breaker, believe it or not. 
 
 
 I love dancing, you all know that but specifically this time, it is Contemporary. 
 
 
 I do  stretching   every single day .

 6. After many years, I first got a stripe T-shirt this month. Hoo-ray the classic! 
 7. Vanilla is my energy-boosting flavour for coffee. 
 8. My mum used to be a florist and I still want her to come back to the field one day! 
 Recently I have been asking people around me about their thoughts of me after long times being together in the friendship or work-ship. I realise that people really change in significant ways that they either know or not know. I keep tracks of my mates' comments about me 5 years ago and now everything is so different. I thought my habits would stay the same but none of them could be the same ways it used to be. Why is that happened? Why cannot we be the same one we wanted to be before the people and the society told us to be the others? Confusing question! 
 I simply just want to live the best life that I have. Changes are not always bad, it is just not easy but when the timing comes, we naturally adapt and transform to be better (or worse). For me, I always choose to be the better version of myself! 
 So give it your all, people! Do your best and no regrets! 
 I will see you soon in April x
