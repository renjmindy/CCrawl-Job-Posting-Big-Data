 Census data favors liberty, capitalism, and small government 
 Posted on  March 29, 2011  |  1 comment 
 Michael Barone's  analysis  of the 2010 census data is worth reading. His conclusion: 
 
 The states, said Justice Brandeis, are laboratories of reform. The 2010 Census tells us whose experiment worked best. It's the state with the same name as the county that's the center of the nation's population: Texas. 
 
 But it's not just Texas: 
 
 The eight states with no state income tax grew 18 percent in the last decade. The other states (including the District of Columbia) grew just 8 percent. 
 The 22 states with right-to-work laws grew 15 percent in the last decade. The other states grew just 6 percent. 
 The 16 states where collective bargaining with public employees is not required grew 15 percent in the last decade. The other states grew 7 percent. 
 
 People naturally move to states where the economies are good, jobs are plentiful, and the cost of living tends to be lower. States with low taxes and workers rights (the opposite of union rights) provide the environment people want. If states like New York, California, and Illinois want to balance their budget and avoid bankruptcy, raising taxes only drives people away and makes the situation worse. It's time for states and the federal government to open their eyes.

 Teachers Unions only care about money 
 Posted on  February 17, 2011  |  7 comments 
 With the massive teachers strikes and protests in Wisconsin, I am very afraid for this country. The Bolshevik Revolution began with protests and union strikes. The Fascists in Italy and Nazis in Germany took over in part to stop the socialist/communist strikes. This country hasn't seen strikes like these since the 1920s. 
 The teachers in Wisconsin don't care about their customers: the students. We hear the cry over and over that "it's for the children," but when the teachers' benefits are called into questions, they abandon the children during the school year to protest about money. 
 Just so you know, US Airways is protesting today down at Phoenix Sky Harbor over some contract dispute.  Airline employees complain they aren't making enough money . What about your customers? Airfares have gone up and quality of service has declined as we are packed into planes like cattle, and we now are poked, prodded, scanned, and molested to get through airport security. And through taxes and airfares, we pay for the right to do so. 
 Teachers unions. Airline unions. All other unions. All you care about is money, so stop pretending otherwise. "Fairness." "Quality education." "Safety." You don't care about any of that. You just want your share, more than your share, of the money. 
 Why should those struggling to make ends meet subsidize unions. Why can't union employees compete in the free market like the rest of us? Because they are not worth what they are being paid? When did the land "of the people, by the people, for the people" become the land of "from the people, against the people, at the expense of the people?"

 Jobs reports: US versus Canada 
 Posted on  February 4, 2011  |  4 comments 
 As mentioned in the previous post , the United States economy created fewer jobs than expected, but the unemployment rate unexpectedly declined. In Canada, the  exact opposite occurred : 
 
 Canada’s job creation in January was more than four times the median forecast, pushing the Canadian dollar to its strongest level since May 2008 and adding to evidence the country’s economic recovery may be accelerating. 
 Employment rose by 69,200 and the labor force increased by 106,400, Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. The jobless rate rose to 7.8 percent from December’s 7.6 percent, as more people sought work. Economists forecast 7.6 percent unemployment and job growth of 15,000, according to the median estimates of 25 and 26 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. 
 
 So which would you rather have? 
 
 US: Unemployment rate declines but few jobs are created. 
 Canada: Many jobs were created but unemployment rate rose. 
 
 Let me know what you think in the comments.

 Jobs report not as good as the unemployment rate implies 
 Posted on  February 4, 2011  |  3 comments 
 Being the lazy person that I am and not wanting to reinvent the wheel, I decided to wait until some other blogger analyzed the latest employment report data. The people at  No Money No Worries  explains how today's report showed a  small increase in jobs but a large decline in the unemployment rate : 
 
 Today’s  unemployment headline  proclaims that the “Unemployment Rate Falls to 9.0%.” However, the number of nonfarm jobs increased very little (+36,000). 
 So, unless we’ve all changed careers to become farmers, something doesn’t add up. 
 All else being equal – with roughly 153 million in the US labor force –  a 0.1% drop in the unemployment rate would require the creation of 153,000 jobs.  A decline of 0.4% would require payroll employment to increase by 4x that amount, or  612,000 jobs. 
 So, one suspects that the headline unemployment rate fell because these workers dropped out of the labor force entirely – and BLS data confirms that is indeed what happened. 
 According to the BLS, the  civilian labor force  in Dec 10 was 153,690,000. January 2011′s dropped to 153,186,000 – a difference of 504,000 workers. 
 So, to sum it up, the 0.4% drop in unemployment was due to: 
 1. 36,000 new jobs; and 
 2. 504,000 workers dropping out of the labor force. 
 Not exactly a stellar report. 
 
 I think that sums it up well. If you enjoy economics and statistics (and some cool charts), I highly recommend  No Money No Worries .

 Britain to fire 500,000 public sector employees. But not really. 
 Posted on  October 21, 2010  |  1 comment 
 As mentioned  earlier , Britain is finally taking action to stave off a credit crisis and possible bankruptcy. Some are reporting that Britain will be firing 500,000 public sector employees. 
 For example,  The Week reports : 
 
 David Cameron is laying off 500,000 government employees. 
 
 However, that will not be the case. As  the Mail reports : 
 
 500,000 public sector jobs to go 
 1 in 10 public sector jobs to go as government gambles on private recovery 
 
 According to the story, this 10% reduction will take 4 or 5 years: 
 
 But they make clear that the Government has adopted the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecast that 490,000 jobs in the public sector will go by 2014/15. 
 
 If the average public sector employee works for 40 years, 10 percent of them would retire within 4 years. In other words, the government will likely lay off very few people. Instead, the British government simply will not fill vacant positions. 
 This is great news, on the one hand, because the British are working to solve their financial problems and this job reduction it is quite easily achievable because it does not actually require firing many people. However, let us not be under the misapprehension that the British government is making a tough choice here. Do not believe the talk that half a million will be laid off. That is simply untrue.

 No sovereign debt crisis here in the U.S., but we've got other problems, namely jobs. 
 Posted on  October 6, 2010  |  Leave a comment 
 The United States may not be experiencing a sovereign debt crisis like Europe, which I have written about quite often recently, but we have our own problems. In Europe, 20 percent unemployment is making it very difficult to balance budgets. While unemployment is not as bad here, we are experiencing the worst economic recovery since the Great Depression.  And today's ADP report proves it : 
 
 Private employers unexpectedly cut 39,000 jobs in September after an upwardly revised gain of 10,000 in August, a report by a payrolls processor showed on Wednesday. 
 The August figure was originally reported as a loss of 10,000. 
 The median of estimates from 38 economists surveyed by Reuters for the ADP Employer Services report, jointly developed with Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, was for a rise of 24,000 private-sector jobs in September. 
 
 Employment fell 63,000 short of expectations, though last month was revised up by 20,000. ADP only measures private employment. The government report due out Friday also includes public sector jobs, which is expected to decline as census workers were recently laid off after the census was completed. 
 
 The ADP figures come ahead of the government's much more comprehensive labor market report on Friday, which includes both public and private sector employment. 
 That report is expected to show overall nonfarm payrolls were unchanged in September, based on a Reuters poll of analysts, but a rise in private payrolls of 75,000. 
 
 Woh! These economists expect 75,000 private sector jobs were created last month when ADP said 39,000 were lost? Seems like somebody is way off the mark here.

 Did World War II lift us out of the Great Depression? 
 Posted on  September 7, 2010  |  2 comments 
 We are constantly told that the economy was lifted out of its Great Depression because of World War II. While it is certainly true that the economic production recovered thanks to war production, I do not believe that the economy actually "recovered" during the war. Of course, it all depends on how you define an economic recovery. The statistical method of doing so is to look at Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or industrial production. However, looking at those figures, even adjusting for inflation, ignores things such as changes in population and demographics. 
 When World War II began, millions joined or were drafted into the armed forces. Their production was lost as they fought overseas. To make up for that loss, women entered the workforce and men worked longer hours. Yes, economic production rose, but the number of hours worked rose even more so. Americans were forced to work instead of spending their time in leisure or raising their families. This was of course good for the many who had previously been unemployed, but bad for those who had already had jobs, housewives who were caring for their children, the elderly who held off on retirement, and the young who skipped college to enter the army. 
 While hours worked were up, most of the increase in production went to war manufacturing. The United States churned out planes, ships, tanks, guns, and bullets. Japan and Germany had a ten-year head start in military production, but the United States quickly caught up once its economic wheels moved forward. Furthermore, much of the food, clothing, and other staples required for day-to-day living were shipped to troops overseas instead of staying within the country's borders. The domestic economy of the United States was dominated by rations and shortages. This was not your typical economic recovery with new products available to consumers and increasing wealth. Instead, it was economic production designed to destroy (though for a good cause) instead of create. The billions of dollars spent on bombs, downed planes, sunk ships, shattered tanks, and bullets was capital forever lost to mankind. 
 With longer work hours, families separated for years, hundreds of thousands of killed soldiers, and production devoted to the military instead of consumers, the standard of living of the average American was no better during World War II than it was during the Great Depression and worse than it was in the 1920s. 
 But what about unemployment which went from 25% down to 1%?  Gene Smiley writes , "The number of unemployed workers declined by 7,050,000 between 1940 and 1943, but the number in military service rose by 8,590,000. The reduction in unemployment can be explained by the draft, not by the economic recovery." He continues, "Most estimates show declines in real consumption spending, which means that consumers were worse off during the war. Business investment fell during the war. Government spending on the war effort exceeded the expansion in real GNP." Smiley does admit that economic measurement during this time was exceedingly difficult, asking "How can we establish a consistent price index when government mandates eliminated the production of most consumer durable goods?" Smiley concludes, "For consumers, the recovery came with the war’s end, when they could again buy products that were unavailable during the war and unaffordable during the 1930s." 
 
 All this says nothing about the need to enter the war against the Japanese and Germans. However, the idea that a war could lift an economy out of depression is tenuous. The economic recovery following World War II was the result of the newfound economic freedom in the United States but even more so overseas where countries such as Germany, Italy, and Japan experienced true freedom for the first time in many years. 
 
 UPDATED: Germany and Italy also "boosted" their economies with military production and conscription. Few would argue that their "economic recoveries" were sustainable or good.

 Big government is producing high unemployment and stagnant wages. 
 Posted on  August 31, 2010  |  3 comments 
 Marketwatch reports  Salaries and wages are rising, but not by much . Even that subdued headline is upbeat when you read some of the details: 
 
 Want some more bad news? Average wages today are lower than a decade ago when adjusted for inflation, according to an analysis earlier this year by the Economic Policy Institute. 
 For high school graduates, median inflation-adjusted wages were $626 per week in 2009, compared with $629 in 2000. If you assume a worker gets paid for a full year that totals $32,552 in 2009, down from $32,708 in 2000. 
 For college graduates, weekly wages were $1,025 in 2009, compared with $1,030 in 2000, according to EPI. Over one year, that works out to $53,300 last year, down from $53,560 in 2000. 
 
 Additionally, the official unemployment rate was just 4.0% back in 2000. Today, it stands at 9.5%. So not only are working Americans earning less, many more are unemployed and earning nothing. 
 The American dream is dying. But why? I again return to this chart,  first posted here . 
 
 As is clearly evident in that chart, the government's intrusion in our economy is at historically high levels. In this recent recession, government spending has hit all new unforeseen levels. But even prior to that, the 90s and 2000s, a period under both Republican and Democratic Presidents and Congresses, saw government spending excluding defense bouncing around the 30% level. Even that much-lauded decline in government spending under President Bill Clinton and the Republican Congress, only saw non-defense government spending decline from 31.87% in 1991 to 28.95% in 2000, a 2.92% decline. By comparison, non-defense government spending rose a 4.86% in 2009 alone. A supposedly major accomplishment that took ten years to achieve was obliterated in less than a year. 
 While non-defense government spending at 28.95% may look appealing now that the figure is about nine percentage point higher, non-defense government spending had never exceeded that level prior to 1982. While many talk about the small government days of Bill Clinton and the Republican Revolution of 1994, remember that FDR, LBJ, and Jimmy Carter all spent less excluding defense (which is wildly volatile depending largely on external affairs) than the U.S.'s recent best. 
 Our experiment with government intervention in society is failing. Government control over a third of the economy has produced high unemployment and stagnant wages. For decades, the United States enjoyed small government and prospered as a results. It is no coincidence that our recent weakness is the result of an overly large and burdensome government.

 Record number in government anti-poverty programs. Fewer people to support them. 
 Posted on  August 30, 2010  |  1 comment 
 In  The Path to Tyranny , I wrote: 
 
 Why work if the government will provide free food, subsidized housing, free health care, and a welfare check? 
 
 It turns out that fewer people are working and more are relying on government assistance. The USA Today reports  Record number in government anti-poverty programs . Here are some of the numbers: 
 
 "More than 50 million Americans are on Medicaid." 
 "The new health care law adds about 16 million people, beginning in 2014." 
 "More than 40 million people get food stamps." 
 "Close to 10 million receive unemployment insurance." 
 "More than 4.4 million people are on welfare." 
 "The federal price tag for Medicaid has jumped 36% in two years, to $273 billion. Jobless benefits have soared from $43 billion to $160 billion. The food stamps program has risen 80%, to $70 billion. Welfare is up 24%, to $22 billion. Taken together, they cost more than Medicare." 
 
 All told, these government welfare programs cost $525 billion. Currently, there are  139 million employed people in the United States . Thus, each worker is taxed about $3,800 to support the unemployed.  The average employee earns about $40,000 per year . So he gives up 9.5% of his wages to be received by the employed.  The unemployment rate is 9.5% , an exact match for this income redistribution scheme. 
 Of course, the average employed person lives much better than the average unemployed person. But this is not always true at the margin. A below average wage earner may find he or she is better off not working and choose to receive government welfare instead. This is especially true if he or she has children and would have to pay for childcare while working. The added childcare expense along with taxes and transportation expense may make it financial wiser to stay unemployed and receive government assistance. 
 Not only are these programs costing hard-working Americans a large portion of their earnings, it is encouraging many to stay at home when they could work and would like to work.

 Teens Going Jobless This Summer. Minimum Wage Laws Partly to Blame. 
 Posted on  July 21, 2010  |  Leave a comment 
 A follow-up to my post  Teens Face Worst Summer Job Market in 41 Years . CNBC reports  Many Teen Workers Are Going Jobless This Summer : 
 
 Several factors have aligned to hurt what was once a vibrant and reliable labor market, experts say. In some cases, unemployed older Americans or illegal immigrants have taken the jobs, while an increase in the minimum wage has made it too expensive for some employers to hire teens. 
 
 Many teenagers would be willing to work for less than the minimum wage, if only it were legal. 
 
 “It’s good experience and it's good to put on your college application,” she says. “You can’t put sitting around and doing nothing on your application.” 
 
 This will have severe repercussions in the future: 
 
 With less experience on their resume, some teens might find it hard to compete for jobs when they’re older, experts say. 
 “Employers across the spectrum are going to opt for someone with more experience.” says Dion Lim, president and COO of online job-search site SimplyHired.com. “There’s no replacement for work experience.” 
 
 Not that the minimum wage is the only cause of teenage unemployment. The article mentions other factors, most notably high unemployment in general. However, the minimum wage is  supposed  to help those at the lower end of the employment market by boosting their wages. Instead, it is making it harder for them to earn any wage and depriving them of much needed experience.
