 Project Leadership 
 As an experienced project manager, you will be responsible for planning all the way to the go-live of your projects. You hold all the strings in your hand and track and analyze the progress of your projects (in-time, in-budget, in-quality). In addition to the project meetings and client workshops, you will conduct regular employee feedback meetings and provide your project team with best practice tips. 
 Project Management 
 Through your experience in dealing with complex web projects, you analyze customer requirements regarding feasibility, budgeting, and profitability and pass the requirements with reduced complexity to your team for implementation. For your own projects you will take over the operative management along the process chain from conception, release planning, and control to project completion including quality assurance. 
 Business Development & Sales 
 You will work very closely with the managing director and support him with your ideas and proactive recommendations for action and thus have a direct influence on the expansion of the &why product and service portfolio.
