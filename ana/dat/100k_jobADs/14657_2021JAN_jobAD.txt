 7 Best Work At Home Jobs For Moms 
 
 The way working online goes, the more work you put in, the more income you can potentially earn. So if something seems easier to do than something else, then you probably won’t be earning much from it. 
 If it’s something that takes more work, you’ll have a chance to make a little more than just pocket change. 
 If you have to learn new skills to build something for your online business, then this will have the best chance of you making a job replacing income online as well as unlimited earning potential! 
 The internet is vast and can earn as much as your imagine limits you so let’s get this started. 
 Here are some of the great ways you can earn at the comforts of your home: 
 
 
 Online Teacher 
 
 
 Mothers are naturally gifted in helping their children learn new ideas, concepts, and skills, which makes online teaching a great job for them. 
 Teaching students across the globe how to read, write, and speak English is a highly in-demand work for quite a few years now. 
 You can find several websites, such as ESL Base, Teach Away, and Go Abroad, that are looking for online teachers. 
 Others post in freelancing platforms, like Upwork, Freelancer, and Hubstaff Talent, and you can connect with your students through Skype and other means of communicating online. 
 Many others create their own online courses and either sell their course for a one time fee or earn recurring fees by having a course that requires a monthly membership fee. 
 Here are more tips on  how to create your own online course . 
 
 
 Social Media Manager 
 
 
 If you’re great with social media and has knowledge about marketing, then you could be a good social media manager. 
 This job will require you to manage all social media accounts of a person or company. 
 If you become a social media manager, you’re going to handle social media marketing campaigns, as well as daily activities, such as coming up with useful and relevant content topics to reach the company’s target clients and monitoring and responding to members in a casual, yet helpful way. 
 You’ll also need to know how to grow their accounts as well as how to get engagement from their audience. 
 
 
 Blogger 
 
 
 Blogging is a great, lucrative way to share your knowledge, and work in a topic you’re knowledgeable and passionate about. 
 It’s a really good way to earn money, this is what I use mostly to earn money online, but it will require a lot of your time and commitment to make it grow and monetize. 
 The great news is, there are so many ways you can earn from your blog. You can use sponsorship, guest posting, display advertising, affiliate marketing (discussed below) and even sell your own handmade products! 
 
 
 Freelance Writer 
 
 
 Another in-demand online job today is content writing. This is actually a favorite of a lot of moms since they can write compelling articles in their spare time. 
 You don’t need to be a professional writer to land a writing job. There are a lot of companies and even other blogs looking for people to write and share their experiences. 
 Many of these sites will even pay you immediately after you give them your work. This is really a good job if you are looking for quick cash. 
 You can go on sites like Upwork or Fiverr to start applying to people’s call for help or set up your own gigs to offer to others. 
 
 
 Virtual Bookkeeper 
 
 
 Virtual bookkeeping is providing accounting services to your client using computerized bookkeeping software. 
 You’re going to handle financial transactions and will review and update financial statements. This kind of job is a bit complicated and will usually require someone who has an accounting background. 
 If you have this background, you can certainly create your own business at home as well and build a local clientele. 
 
 
 Virtual Assistant 
 
 
 A virtual assistant is somewhat like a secretary, except you’re going to work at home. 
 If you’re going to work as a virtual assistant or a VA, you’re going to do a variety of things, like monitoring emails, scheduling meetings, managing blogs, data entry, sending invoices, etc. 
 Many companies now, be it small or big, are looking for hardworking VAs. There might be a lot of work, but VAs receive a really good income. After all, moms are really good at multitasking! 
 You can find these types of jobs also on Upwork or Fiverr. 
 
 
 Affiliate Marketer 
 
 
 The best way to earn money on the internet is to have your own online business and one way to achieve that is through affiliate marketing. 
 More and more moms now are diving into the affiliate marketing world because of the vast opportunities it offers. 
 Affiliate marketing is basically promoting other people’s products and you receive a commission each time the company makes a sale through your efforts. 
 This means that you don’t need to worry about a large capital to start your business as well as an idea on what product you’re going to sell. 
 Affiliate marketing is suitable for moms, particularly those who have limited resources. Not only that, it’s really flexible because you can work literally anywhere and anytime you want. 
 You don’t have to follow a schedule and no worrying about a manager or supervisor keeping an eye on you. If you’re one of them, then you should definitely consider affiliate marketing. 
 All you need to have is a working website and an affiliate program. 
 How to Start Affiliate Marketing 
 
 Because this is the way I make a 4 digit monthly online income with affiliate marketing, I will go more into what this is about here and how you can get started too. 
 The following main steps are what you’ll need to do to start an affiliate marketing business. 
 Step 1 
 To start, you need to focus on a niche, something you’re passionate and knowledgeable about. You don’t want to pick a topic too wide or broad because you want to be able to help a certain group of people initially. 
 Therefore, say cooking, there are so many ways to niche down with that like: Italian pastas, Pastas for Diabetics, Low Carb Quick Meals, Vegan Lifestyle for Seniors, etc. 
 Step 2 
 Create a website  for your new affiliate marketing business. Usually, affiliate marketing websites are in the blog WordPress format so affiliate marketing is actually a very common ways to monetize a blog. 
 There are places where you can  build a blog websites in under a minute  these days without knowing any coding at all. 
 Once your website is created, you’ll be building content on there by writing blog posts. Blog posts are like this page you’re reading, just friendly advice in a conversational tone, anyone can write like this, especially on a topic you love and passionate about. 
 Writing these blog posts will start educating your audience in the particular areas you want to help in. By providing value, this is how you’ll create trust between you and your readership. 
 Step 3 
 Once you have created your blog website, it’s time to look for affiliate programs that relate to your topic. You basically want to find affiliate offers you can promote with your niche. 
 After signing for these programs, you’re going to receive a special link where you’re going to place in your content on your website so people can click it and make a purchase. 
 After signing up for an affiliate program, your focus now is to reach your target audience. The best way to get them to your website is through unique, helpful, and interesting content. 
 Write topics about things that will entice them and those that are useful. You have to be consistent in writing content so that they will keep coming back and will even recommend your blog. 
 By building this content, you will be ranking on search engines and that is how people will find your blog. 
 Eventually, if you know how to build this properly, your blog will rank on first page of google and that’s when your visitors will be rushing onto your online business to check out your valuable content! 
 This is called attraction marketing and it’s the best way to highly targeted FREE traffic to your online business. 
 Step 4 
 This is when you’ll be making money! 
 Once you have a connection with your readers, they will start trusting your recommendations and will start clicking on your links which are affiliate links. 
 When recommending your products, it’s better you write it in the first person. People always prefer personal reviews and recommendations. 
 When they go buy the products you recommended, you will earn commissions! 
 For this to happen, you will have to be very patient, work hard even when not earning, and make sure you keep creating valuable content. 
 Important Things to Note 
 It’s important to note that while affiliate marketing is a great way to earn income, you’re not going to see your desired results right away. 
 Like other methods of monetizing your blog, affiliate marketing will need a lot of hard work and devotion. 
 Here’s a quick look at the first 2 years of my online business with affiliate marketing: 
 The way you earn is very gradual but once you breakthrough and start earning 3 digits, 4 digits follow quickly, and then I made almost $8K in my 23rd month! 
 The potential to earn is much more as I keep growing my business and my blog. 
 But, I didn’t know how to do this in the beginning and that’s why I got training so I can cut down my learning curve.  The training I got  did just that and even made me a Super Affiliate in 2018. 
 Getting training  means you’re going to have access to tutorials and courses that will teach you effective methods that many successful affiliate marketers have tried and succeeded with, as well as new strategies and updates so you can keep up with your competitors. 
 You can  check my free guide here  to see what training platform I use that has greatly help me with my success. 
 It’s also a training platform specifically for affiliate marketing using a blog website so it’s perfect for you if you want to go this route. 
 
 For me, affiliate marketing is, no doubt, one of the best work at home jobs for moms. Making money online is not easy in general so getting a proven path to follow will be essential to your online success! 
 Building an online business could get hard but, when you start  earning a stable income  like I do, you will see that everything you have worked hard for are truly worth it!
