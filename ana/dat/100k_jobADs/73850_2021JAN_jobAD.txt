 Find a Campground Job: Here's the Secret for Finding a Job You'll Love 
 Find a campground job that you love! You'll be where you want to work. You'll be working with RVers that you want to work with. Here's the secret for doing just that. 
 Physically go to the area where you want to work before accepting a job. Find a campground there that looks appealing to you. Check in as a paying customer for a few days. Look. Listen. Absorb. Be out and about. Visit with the campers. Visit with the staff and management. Get a feel for the place. 
 If you like what you see and hear there, if it feels right, then approach management about a work. Apply for the job in person. 
 That way, you will have a better idea of what the campground is like. You’ll know if the park is someplace you'd like to spend an extended time. You'll know about the people, the facilities, and the community. 
 And, the campground management will know about you. You won't need to tell them that you are neat, articulate, and talented because they will see it for themselves. They'll see that you are sociable or have particular skills. They may see you physically doing certain jobs. They will know that you are there, ready and willing to go to work now. 
 If, after a few days there as a customer, you don't like it there, you can easily move to another park and repeat the process. At the very least, you will be in an area where you want to spend time. Even if you don't find a campground job there, you could likely find some other work. Your trip would not have been a waste. 
 I have heard oh so many sad tales from work campers who spent much time and money traveling somewhere for the sole purpose of a specific job. When they got there, the job wasn't what they thought it would be. Or, the park didn't look like the brochure pictures. Or, they generally disliked that part of the country. 
 I've probably heard nearly as many negative reports from park managers who’ve hired RVers across the miles. They hire campers to work and depend on them. But, when the RVers arrive, they aren’t as they represented themselves. Or, at the last minute, they call and cancel. Or, worse yet, the RVers simply didn't show up for the job. 
 If you accept a campground job from hundreds or thousands of miles away, without having been there first, you are asking for trouble. 
 Go to the area where you want to work and then find a campground job. It works out best for the camper and the campground owner.

There are so many kinds of work to do while RVing and camping (what some campers call workcamping or work camping). We help RV workers -- whether snowbirds or full-time RVers -- find campground jobs, volunteer jobs, jobs with RV spaces, seasonal jobs, mobile employment, short-term paid employment, and other ways to earn an income and cut expenses while enjoying life in a recreational vehicle.
