 How A Junk Mail Flyer Changed My Career 
 Posted on  July 14, 2014  by   isdnow 
 Who would have thought that receiving a junk mail flyer in my mailbox would have changed my career? How was I to know that this one particular flyer would have a significant impact on my professional life? 
 Dr. Greg Williams, Program Director for UMBC's ISD Graduate Program, shares his story of how junk mail changed the trajectory of his career. 
 Junk Mail Offered a New Direction 
 In 1999, I was living in the Federal Hill neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland. One day I received a flyer in the U.S. mail from an online university. They were recruiting potential faculty to teach online for them. I had wondered about teaching online, but never really did anything about before. From my research, reading and conversations with professional colleagues, it seemed like eLearning was poised to grow. And now, a supposed piece of junk mail confirmed it! 
 At the time of receiving this flyer, I was working at Towson University at the time in a staff position. I mentioned to a faculty member that I was thinking about going through the online university's faculty training program. To my surprise he said that he knew someone who had gone through the same program and thought that it was excellent. 
 It All Started with a Junk Mail Flyer 
 I decided to enroll in the course. I thought it would be good for my career. I was right. Prior to this training course I had never taken an eLearning course myself, nor had I taught one. I had some limited experience with eLearning, but I never taught a complete online class. 
 This particular class required us to be available for 20 hours of class time, homework and studying each week. There were no exceptions for anyone. If you missed class time or were late on your assignments, you were removed form the class and had to start over again. 
 The course was modeled after the online university's regular 5 week format. We experienced the same thing as students taking our courses. This helped to develop empathy, as well as to "walk a mile" in the students' shoes. 
 It was a demanding and challenging experience. However, I learned a great deal. It was the foundation for developing my eLearning skills. Here is some of what I learned. 
 What I Learned About eLearning 
1. It's not "easy" being an online student. Online learning is not for everyone. 
2. Online students need good time management skills, be motivated and disciplined. 
3. eLearning is not about the technology. While online teachers use technology, a successful course is more about their ability to facilitate their learning. 
4. Communication is very different. We know how simple email communication can easily get misunderstood. That misunderstanding can grow exponentially when it comes to eLearning. 
 Other Lessons Learned 
1. Be open to change, it's how we grow. 
2. You never know where or when opportunities may pop up. 
3. Use critical thinking and don't believe everything you hear. 
4. Take some calculated career risks. 
5. Your career is dynamic, so you need to be dynamic too. 
 Because the flyer, my career would never be the same. It opened up a number of life-changing opportunities for me. Maybe you have some opportunities coming your way too. Would you recognize them? Be open-minded and give them a chance. 
 Lastly, take a quick glance at your junk mail before you throw it away. 
 Always in Learning Mode,
