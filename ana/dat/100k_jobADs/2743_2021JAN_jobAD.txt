 Every candidate has a talent and diversity of skills that employers are looking for. The problem is how to identify candidate's capabilities and match employer's and candidate's motivations. For that purpose, we introduce a PitchMe process - a novel approach for management of Human Resources relying on multilayer profiling of skills and matchmaking between those who offer skills and those who need them. 
 Our mission is to empower candidates to demonstrate their real abilities and knowledge allowing anyone with relevant skillset to apply for a position regardless of their professional background. 
 To date, we have >90.000 candidates using our platform and >300 employers. We have just recently closed a funding round and will be scaling fast.
