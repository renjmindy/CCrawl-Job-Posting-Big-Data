 JOHN WINSTON LENNON 
 This day, 35 years ago, marks the passing of English singer 
and songwriter and former member of  The Beatles  , John Lennon. 
(Born John Winston Lennon; Oct. 9, 1940 – 8 Dec.19, 80) 
 _John Lennon was an English musician who gained worldwide fame as one of the members of the  Beatles  , for his subsequent solo career, and for his political activism and pacifism. _ 
 He was shot by "a deranged American gunman" (  I refuse to use his name  ) in the archway of the building where he lived,  The Dakota  , in New York City on 8 December 1980. 
 Lennon had just returned from Record Plant Studio with his wife, Yoko Ono. 
 After sustaining four fatal gunshot wounds, Lennon was pronounced dead on arrival at Roosevelt Hospital. He was 40 years old. 
 _At the hospital, it was stated that nobody could have lived for more than a few minutes after sustaining such injuries. Shortly after local news stations reported Lennon 's death, crowds gathered at Roosevelt Hospital and in front of the Dakota. _ 
 Lennon was cremated on 10 December 1980 at the Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York. The ashes were given to Ono, who chose not to hold a funeral for him.

 I'm originally from Puerto Rico. I was born in Santurce and raised in Rio Piedras. I currently live in Florida - since 1999. I have a doctorate degree in Medicine; completed in 1976. My Internal Medicine specialty was completed in 1979. Worked for Puerto Rico's health system until 1985. At this time, I'm happily retired after working for the federal government for almost 28yrs. I also worked for the government of Puerto Rico from 1979 through 1985 .... for a total of almost 40 years as a physician. I want to offer any knowledge that I have to anyone "out there" who is interested. My views are liberal in almost every sense. My knowledge is "eclectic" - a bit of everything. Music and reading are my passion. Blogging has also become a very interesting endeavor. Metaphysical topics attract me. I'm interested in news - reporting human issues like injustice, discrimination and abuse - the "wrongly" affected. My intention is to bring this knowledge to an understandable level and to help anyone in need. I'm open to questions and will answer them to the best of my ability. Currently working on an enterprise whose main mission will be to bring peoples of all walks of life together. To be one .... since we ALL are ONE!! The future looks bright and promising!!!
