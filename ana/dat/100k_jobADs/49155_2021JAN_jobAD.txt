 Tuesday the 17th: Psych (2009) 
 
 I knew we never should have come back here 
 So this episode of  Psych  is a parody of  Friday the 13th , hence the  Tuesday the 17th.  I thought that since we don't have a Friday the 13th or a Tuesday the 17th, so I thought it would be awesome to have this on Friday the 17th, so its a combination of both. 
 So for those of you who aren't  Psych  fans, the series is about a guy, Shawn Spencer, who pretends to be a psychic and works with the Santa Barbara Police Department. His BFF, Burton "Gus" Guster, helps him out. He works with Head detective Carlton Lassiter and junior detective Juliet O'Hara. 
 Spolier Alert 
 So the episode starts off with Shawn and Gus in their preteens at summer camp. They are being picked up by Shawn's dad, and Shawn is pissed. He is mad at for Gus choosing  Jason  as a partner over him for the piñata contest. (They picked the name Jason in reference to the boy and later killer, Jason Voorhees.) As we transition to the present we get a the theme song from  Friday the 13th  series and a creepy view of Shawn's piñata, Rick Astley, stuck under the water. 
 
 20 years later a girl, Annie (named after the stupid Annie that is killed in the original  Friday the 13th)  is sitting down watching one of the  Friday the 13th  films. 
 
 Ren Stevens: What? Honey, you're chased by six mutants, and you just decided to take a shower? 
 She decides to go off, when the phone rings like  When a Stranger Calls . 
 
 But its just her friends and she tells them she is feeling sick and going to stay home. All of a sudden she is attacked from behind!!! 
 
 Back at the  Psych  building, Shawn and Gus find Shawn's old summer camp piñata hanging outside their building. Jason did it as a joke as he came to ask the two to help them. Jason is reopening the summer camp this upcoming Friday, but one of his counselors, Annie, is missing. Shawn doesn't want to return, but Gus convinces him to go back there. 
 There the two meet Billy (named after Billy in  Scream  ), the  jock  and fitness counselor; Clive, the  nerd  and the water instructor; and Sissy, the  damsel in distress  in charge of arts and crafts. They start investigating, when Jason starts acting weird. He keeps speaking strange and walking around with a dummy. 
 
 They start breaking up into twos and singles, which angers Shawn as everyone is breaking the horror film rules. Never split up! 
 
 While they go off into the woods, Billy gets taken by the killer. 
 
 They all meet up again, at 6:00 minus Billy. Sissy shows Gus and Shawn the laundry room; in which they discover Annie's pjs, covered in blood. 
 
 Shawn gets freaked out and calls Juliet O'Hara from the SBPD to come down and check things out. She gets everyone to stay inside the cabin. When Jason leaves, Shawn chases after him. As he is running and looking for him, he notices the laundry room going again. He goes inside and finds Annie's strangled body. After that, a man in a potato bag (like that in  Butterfinger the 13th ) chases after him. Shawn screams and runs away. 
 
 AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Only to be caught by the killer! 
 
 But all is not what it seems. Shawn figures out that Jason is behind it all and that it is merely a camp created to scare people. The counselors are actors. People pay to come and get scared out of their minds. It's like living a horror movie, except you know you will survive in the end. 
 So everyone goes back to the cabin and celebrates the "rehearsal" of the event. 
 
 Everything is great until Shawn spots a dead body in the pond. 
 
 Victim #1 
 They all pull him out and discover that it is the creepy janitor. There is a huge storm that starts up, causing no to be able to leave. Or come to them. 
 
 All have to wait until it blows over. They decide to play strip cribbage, as stupid as the strip monopoly they play in  Friday the 13th. 
 
 Well I don't make out alive. Must have been too much strip monopoly. 
 Billy ends up being the one who looses all his clothes. And you know what that means…..Yep let the bodies hit the floor. 
 After the janitor, Annie is killed and then Billy when he goes to check the breaker after the lights go out. 
 Shawn figures out that it is Clive and goes after Billy, finding his dead body. Juliet chases Annie down and discovers that she is dead too. They go looking for Clive and find him fighting with Gus. One gets knocked into the pool and Shawn jumps into the pool thinking it was Gus. It's not, it's Clive!!! 
 
 AAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Clive tries to attack Shawn, letting him know that the reason he is doing so is because his father died at this camp and he wanted to get revenge. 
 
 Very similar to the orginal  Friday the 13th  film 
 Luckily Juliet manages to shoot him before he can harm Shawn. 
   
 The episode ends with Shawn, Gus, and Juliet looking off into the distance. Thinking about the horror they've witnessed. 
 
 You know how the original  Friday the 13th  ended, with Jason coming out of the water? Well, they parodied that too, except with Rock Astley.
