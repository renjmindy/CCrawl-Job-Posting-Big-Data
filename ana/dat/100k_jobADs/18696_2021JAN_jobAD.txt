  6 Rules for Social Media Use  
 J.T. O'Donnell 
 November 23, 2010 
 FACT:  Social media has the ability to make the single greatest impact on your career identity. 
 If you aren't leveraging tools like  Facebook ,  LinkedIn , and most importantly,  Twitter , you could find yourself at a disadvantage very soon. 
 Now, if you are rolling your eyes and saying to yourself,  "Is she kidding? I'm already addicted to my Crackberry. I don't have time to spend hours each day with this stuff,"  then you are in luck. Because this presentation teaches you the  6 rules to using social media to create a strong career identity. 
 Here's just a couple of things you'll learn: 
 Rule #2 - Take it Slow 
 Are you guilty of using cheezy pick up lines when you network online? You could be and may not even know it! 
 Rule #5 - Choose Your Brand (HINT: Specialize) 
 You can't be all things online. So, it's important to identify how you will stand out from the crowd. Do you know how to make sure people know what you do best? 
 In just 10 minutes/day (c'mon now, it takes you longer to shower, dress and brush your teeth), you can develop a personal brand online that will make your career identity standout. 
 Recently, I spoke to the  Catapult Seacoast Young Professionals  group and taped the session. In it, you'll learn the 6 rules and why they are critical for success. Moreover, I outline how ANYONE can create a personal brand online that will get them noticed. Better still, I prove why you need to understand the  #1 career truth: brand or be branded . 
 Watch below... 
 NOTE: I had a terrible time trying to get this thing converted/loaded. It was filmed in HiDef but you'd never know it! We are looking for a way to put 30 minute self-help courses like this one on line without looking so blurry. So, if you know tools/resources that can help - please let us know!
