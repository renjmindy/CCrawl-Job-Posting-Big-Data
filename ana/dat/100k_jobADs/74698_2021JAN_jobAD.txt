 The followings are advice on how to succeed in business and i am not sure what the red parts mean. 
 Smart enterpreneneurs will define what they're about. They will get better cliensts with a more narrow focus and they will get their ideal clients without having to compete on price. It will take much less of a sales job to convince their customers they( here they mean enterpreneurs??) know how to serve them. (here them mean customers????) (?????????????) ...

 " It will take much less of a sales job to convince their customers they know how to serve them." 
 This means that a smart entrepreneur won't have to expend so much energy (less of a sales job) convincing their customers that they (the entrepreneur) know how to serve them (the customers).

 I have some other confusion about this! 
Parents have to do much less for their children today than they used to do, and home has become  much less  of a workshop 
What does "MUCH LESS" here mean??

 It should mean parents have a lot less duties/obligations/work raising their children. Home used to be a workshop to a greater extent - now it is home a lot more than it is a workshop.
