 The Company 
 BenevolentAI unites technology with human intelligence to re-engineer drug discovery and deliver life-changing medicines. We have developed the Benevolent Platform®, a drug discovery platform built on powerful data foundations with state of the art machine learning and AI technology. Our technology empowers scientists to decipher the vast and complex code underlying human biology, find new ways to treat disease and personalise medicines to patients. Benevolent has active in-house R&D drug programmes in disease areas such as neurodegeneration, immunology, oncology and inflammation and has research and commercial collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and research organisations. The company is headquartered in London with a research facility in Cambridge (UK) and a further office in New York. 
 Who we are 
 We are an eclectic bunch at Benevolent, united by our belief that innovative thinking and purposeful technology can truly change outcomes for the better. Our mission is to re-engineer drug discovery and deliver life-changing medicines for patients in need and we do this by applying AI, machine learning and other advanced technologies to reinvent the ways drugs are discovered and developed. We strive to bring together unique skills and perspectives across biology, chemistry, engineering, AI research, informatics, precision medicine and drug discovery. 
 The Role 
 We are looking for a highly experienced medicinal chemist at Senior Principal Scientist level. As a key part of our Chemical Sciences team, you’ll be responsible for multiple teams of internal and CRO chemists on our Drug Discovery programmes from Hit ID through to Lead Optimisation and Candidate delivery, utilising AI to drive down cycle times and identify the best compounds for progression into the clinic. 
 The successful Candidate will be working to support small molecule Drug Discovery at our headquarters in London. Working with cheminformaticians, computational chemists, AI modellers and Drug Discovery colleagues you’ll devise creative ways to reimagine the way medicines are discovered. 
 Primary Responsibilities 
 
 You will be responsible for oversight of the medicinal chemistry strategy on multiple Drug Discovery programmes, either via direct leadership of teams of internal and/or external CRO chemists, or through mentoring of the chemistry leads on these programmes. 
 With a strong medicinal chemistry background, you will work as a highly influential member of project teams and ideally lead project teams, providing clear strategic direction aligned with company goals. 
 You will work closely with experts across biology, pharmacology & DMPK as well as machine learning and cheminformatics experts. 
 You will possess a good awareness of current and emerging state of the art technologies and strategies within synthetic chemistry as applied to drug discovery. 
 Improve the drug discovery process through proactive and positive problem-solving allowing you to contribute strategically and implement ideas to drive projects forward. 
 Direct supervision of others will form part of the role and matrix leadership of cross-functional teams may also be required. 
 You will establish and maintain close working relationships with Senior Management for project planning, alignment and delivery. 
 
 We are looking for someone with 
 
 A PhD or equivalent experience in synthetic organic chemistry or very closely related area 
 10+ years experience in an industrial setting applying medicinal chemistry expertise to the successful advancement of drug discovery projects to important milestones. 
 A track record of significant, innovative personal contributions to the progression of multiple Drug Discovery programmes and the identification of Candidate Drugs. 
 You’ll have a strong ability to critically analyse and act upon complex datasets across e.g. synthetic chemistry, biological and DMPK data, AI predictions and many other areas and a track record of providing innovative solutions to advance Drug Discovery programmes. 
 Previous line management experience and the ability to motivate and develop team members required. 
 You will be comfortable and thrive working in a fast-paced, dynamic environment and on multiple projects with changing priorities and deadlines. 
 Examples of using novel data analyses or AI approaches in compound design or progression would be an advantage. 
 Previous project leadership experience preferred.
