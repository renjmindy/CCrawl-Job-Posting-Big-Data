 Tom Fernandez-Buckley 
 For one of our boutique consulting clients, we are currently looking for IT Architects of all levels. This is a fantastic opportunity to build your portfolio by working on a wide variety of high-level projects across multiple industries, on topics ranging from CIO advisory, IT strategy and IT / business as well as digital transformation projects. 
As an IT Architect you are technologically up to date and have, e.g., until recently worked as a developer yourself. You are aware of the typical problems of development processes, and you consider problematic technical details a challenge. However, you want to grow professionally and wish to use your experience to advise and support clients as part of a team. 
You will work actively on national and international client projects in interdisciplinary teams with colleagues and/or on-site at the client's premises. Your tasks will depend on the client or project situation. 
 Typical tasks include the following: 
 
 You will support clients in the operational implementation of risky and business-critical projects. Together with the client, you will develop and maintain the project and resource plan, monitor and validate the project's progress, and escalate to the project leadership if necessary 
 You will conduct architecture and code reviews, make recommendations for improvement, and perform technical proofs of concept 
 You will develop functional and IT concepts for the introduction or further development of business-critical core systems 
 You will analyze and evaluate the software development process and tools used by the client 
 You will perform load and performance tests for complex and business-critical applications of the client's within very short periods of time 
 
 You should have the following professional background and personal skills: 
 
 A university or college degree in a mathematical-scientific field, information technology, or business management 
 Experience in professional software development or IT project management 
 Extensive technical expertise (current technology and programming languages, agile development methods, big data and cloud technologies) 
 Expertise in project planning and controlling 
 Outstanding analytical and conceptual skills 
 Business-fluent written and spoken German and English language skills 
 Distinct client- and results-orientation 
 Teamworking, communication, and presentation skills 
 Flexibility, ability to work under pressure, and willingness to travel 
 
 For consideration please send us your CV as well as your academic certificates and salary expectations to  tomf@venquis.com  and we will be in touch for an initial discussion. Feel free to call me on +49 (0)89 2109 3906 for more information.
