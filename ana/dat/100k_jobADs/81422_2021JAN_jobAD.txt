 Making credit scoring fair, using the power of Open Banking 🌍 
 Role overview 
 We're building a credit bureau the right way - with the customer involved and transparent throughout. We're looking for talented and creative engineers who share our vision 🚀. 
 We work closely as a company 
 We're a small team with a big vision, so no-one specialises too much - we wear many hats week-to-week 🧢. 
 We're grappling with a large problem so there are plenty of challenges to be faced but we face them one weekly sprint at a time. Your role here would see you working with the founders of the company and the rest of the team on a wide range of issues to bring our vision of a better credit bureau to reality. 
 Our team has a diverse background 
 Not everyone studied Computer Science here and we have at least one classically trained opera singer 🎤. We have people with backgrounds in massive companies, small companies and a few for whom this is their first job. We're looking for people who want to learn and grow; if that sounds like you, we'd love to hear from you. 
 Our tech stack: 
 - Golang and Ruby on Rails for our core applications and APIs. 
 - Python for our data processing and science. 
 - Typescript with React and Redux for most of our front-end flows. 
 - Brand new open banking APIs for collecting financial data. 
 - Postgres for our data storage. 
 - Docker for running everything reliably. 
 - AWS for all our infrastructure (managed as code via Terraform). 
 Your Profile 
 We're looking for people who: 
 - Are excited by our mission 🚀. 
 - Are keen to learn and develop their skills and knowledge 📚. 
 - Are comfortable diving into problems in open discussions 🗣. 
 - Are interested in building a data-oriented company 🔢. 
 - Love writing elegant and well-tested software 💻. 
 - Have some experience with distributed systems 🧠. 
 What we value: 
 - Motivation, enthusiasm and passion for our mission to take on the big credit bureaus 🏦. 
 - Expansive thinking, transparency, honesty, and a good sense of humour 💛 
 - Results and efficiency rather than hours in the office 🏡

 Credit Kudos is a venture-backed fintech startup and challenger credit bureau that uses financial behaviour to measure creditworthiness. 💳 Our technology transforms the way credit checking and credit scores work by generating a more accurate and holistic view of a borrower's creditworthiness. We’re working with lenders to help them make better, fairer credit decisions and with consumers to help them access fair, affordable credit. ⚖️ Our mission is to transform the credit scoring system to provide fairer credit for all; helping people access responsible finance they can afford, when they need it. 🤝 How it all began: After working in the US for a number of years, Freddy returned to the UK ✈️. Having had no recent financial activity in the UK, he had a 'thin' credit file. This not only meant that he had limited credit options, but those that were available to him came with higher interest rates and restrictions 🙁. After further research it became apparent that he was not alone, and that many people in the UK face difficulties when trying to get access to affordable credit 💳. With a vision to remove that challenge from the market, Freddy and Matt founded Credit Kudos 👋. Since then, the team at Credit Kudos have been on a mission to provide fair credit for all, harnessing the power of Open Banking 🌍. We’re building a credit bureau the right way - with the customer involved and transparent throughout. We’re looking for talented and creative engineers who share our vision. 🚀
