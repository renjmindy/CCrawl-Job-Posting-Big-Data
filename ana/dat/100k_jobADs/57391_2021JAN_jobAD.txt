 Planting chestnut seeds

 "Once upon a time a king was strolling through the forest and he saw an old man, a poor man, bent over a furrow. He walked up to him and saw that he was planting seeds for chestnut trees. He asked the old man why he was doing it and the old man replied, 'I love the taste of chestnuts.' 
 "The king responded, 'Old man, stop punishing your back bent over a hole in the ground. Do you really not know that by the time even one of these trees has grown tall enough to bear nuts, you may not be around to gather them?' 
 "And the old man answered, "Your Majesty, if my ancestors had thought the way you do, I would never have tasted chestnuts.'" (Juan Gomez-Jurado,  God 's Spy , Orion Books, Great Britain, 2007, p.164-165) 
 Questions for reflection  : 
 1. Who are your ancestors -- in work and family, community and nation, church and neighborhood -- who planted the seeds of privilege and success you can enjoy today? Name them. Thank them. 
 2. a) What have your predecessors done to make life a blessing for you today? Financially? Socially? Vocationally? Be specific. 
 b) How did they themselves benefit from their sacrifice of resources, time and energy?
 
 3. To what extent do you live your life today for the benefit of future generations, and not primarily your own? What areas of your life reflect this future-orientation of your work, time, and leisure activities? 
 4. Why do you think it may be a challenge to consider how you live now as extending beyond the scope of your own personal interests? What are the obstacles to living life 'for the sake of others'? 
 5. What is one thing you can do today that represents: 
 a) a thanksgiving for the sacrifice of previous generations? and/or 
 b) a prayer, a gift to others or a specific action whose purpose is primarily for the benefit of future generations and not your own?
