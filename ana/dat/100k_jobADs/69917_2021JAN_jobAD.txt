  Back-Breaking Job! Literally.  
 Work It Daily 
 October 28, 2009 
 Dear Experts, I've been at a new job for 2 months now and my back is killing me. The chair I have to sit in is so uncomfortable. I've asked for something different but my boss said nothing is available. I brought in a pillow to sit on and my boss seems mad, as if I'm being dramatic. I've never had a back issue before. I'd like to propose buying my own chair to sit in, but I don't think my boss will like the idea. What can I do?  Here is how our CAREEREALISM-Approved Experts answered this question on Twitter:   Q#351  Go find a good Chiropractor! Being free of pain is worth it, and insurance may cover it. ( @JoshuaWaldman )  Q#351  Getting injured is not what your company wants! Visit doctor & get note saying you need new chair. ( @jtodonnell )  Q#351  I would either use the pillow or buy my own. No use being in pain. Make sure you're moving around often! ( @beneubanks )  Q#351  I would visit the doctor and see if he can find an issue. Either way, have a frank on-on-one conversation with the boss. ( @gradversity )  Q#351  Prop 2 boss must show BENEFIT, allay concerns: delivery? reaction by other staff? liability? removal? ( @juliaerickson )  Q#351  UR health paramount. Present proposal to pay for UR own chair & purch on UR own time. Improved productivity. No whining. ( @dawnbugni )  Our Twitter Advice Project (T.A.P.) is no longer an active campaign. To find an answer to the above question, please use the "Search" box in the right-hand column of this website.
