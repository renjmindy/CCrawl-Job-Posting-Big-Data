 More about this opening 
 In Backbase, I learn something new every single day. Working on Service SDK is challenging but exciting at the same time. Backbase is definitely a place to be if you want to constantly evolve and grow as a professional. 
 Allie Ward Senior QA Engineer, UK Hub 
 I'm a huge fan of diversity at Backbase. I love the freedom and ownership opportunities at work. I'm proud of the new solution that we are building. We had a simple idea and the solution that I've proposed is the one that we are working on. 
 Hari Vignesh Android Engineer, EMEA Hub 
 What excites me most about working at Backbase is understanding the diverse needs of our customers and working with the team to solve them within the real-world constraints. 
 Grace Brady Product Owner, EMEA Hub 
 Call me crazy but I love my job. I get paid to work on puzzles with my friends, play pool and learn new tech. 
 Patrick Newcombe Senior Full Stack Engineer, UK Hub 
 The biggest challenge I overcame with my team was creating an entirely new mobile product from scratch, aligning an entirely new team with people from very different backgrounds and creating a way of working which has the DNA of Backbase in it. 
 Harneek Singh Senior QA Engineer, EMEA Hub 
 Bringing a mobile-first approach to an industry with brick and mortar companies is not about the solutions or products you deliver but about that mentor-mentee relationship you develop with them along the way. 
 Tibor Beke Android Engineer, EMEA Hub
