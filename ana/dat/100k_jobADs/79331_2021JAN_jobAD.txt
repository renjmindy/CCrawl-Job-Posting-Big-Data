 Multi lingual IT Jobs in Dublin, the world really is your oyster! Dutch/French/German/Italian/Danish/Hungarian 
 Leave a Comment  /  Jobs in Ireland  / By    Katleen  
 Hi all, 
 There has been a lot of speculation lately that maybe we should be teaching our children Mandarin Chinese. 
 I thought this was an interesting article where  Brown Thomas  has hired extra staff to deal with Mandarin Chinese buyers.  David Cameron  reckons that British kids should ditch French and learn Mandarin Chinese instead. 
 Maybe so,  it seems that languages more local to Europe are very much in demand in and around Dublin too, as you can see from the below list.. 31 vacancies with interesting starting salaries.

 In my experience, having German has always been my strong point, in combination with other languages, as an employer finds it hard enough to find German speakers. 
 Of course Dutch would be great too, but chances that you'll take Dutch at school is very slim, so the majority of Dutch speakers will be "imported", as it's not a language that's taught at school. 
 An employer loves to have someone who has various languages, but in my experience those that tend to have those multi languages natively( ie taught at school) are going to be European( affectionally called continentals here), and quite likely from the Benelux, Switzerland or an area in France called the  Alsace . 
 There is major room for improvement/integration of language tuition in Ireland at an earlier age, and there is one organisation who's actively involved in rallying for this which is called Post Primary Languages Initiative . 
Folllow their Facebook page  here ,  or visit their  website
