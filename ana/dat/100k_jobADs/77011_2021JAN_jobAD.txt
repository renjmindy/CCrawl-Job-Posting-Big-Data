 Fashion: The Career-girl 
 Posted by  thefrustratedmangaka  on  May 11, 2014November 27, 2016 
 A  career- woman girl  (I think I’m too young to be called a “woman”  charot . Nyahaha~) when the sun is up; 
 A  nocturnal frustrated mangaka ; 
 A  couch potato  ,  fangirl  ,  movie buff  , and sometimes a ‘  traveler  ’ (not really a traveler but someone who’s  gala ng gala  with Towties) every end of the week. 
 That’s how I basically waste spend my precious time. This post, with 4 parts, is about how I usually look everyday. Let’s start first with my “ **  career-girl fashion **.” 
 What I’m going to wear  first depends on my mood  , then  on the weather . There are times when I feel like being a girl wearing skirts and  tiis-ganda  heels, and there are times when I wear pants and super comfy flats. 
 The Chic Chick 
 This is my  favorite  when I dress up. I go gaga over pink and denim combination. Too bad I can’t have this look right now since it’s a gigantic sauna outside. It’s summer now in the Philippines. I don’t know why but wearing a dress makes me feel beautiful. FYI, my masculinity is more dominant than my femininity. Lol~ 
 When I use mini skirts, I usually wear them over black leggings. There’s this feeling that when I wear short skirts, my actions seem limited.  I’m a very wacky person  , and I usually make big gestures or movements so I don’t like suppressing myself. So the best solution would be leggings. 
 This was my  not-so  #ootd (  kelangan may  hashtag  talaga ? Haha  baka mag  -trend lol) last May 2. Why the “not-so”?  I use my favorite backpack EVERY-SINGLE-TIME . So even if I’m wearing skirts or heels, I still use my backpack no matter how unfashionable it may seem lol. 
 My #ootd last Wednesday (5.7). I want to wear doll shoes for this but I chose to wear my pink shoes (similar to the picture) since it’s more comfortable. 
 Another not-so #ootd last Friday (5.9). The black dress was  sponsored  by my  nanay  slash  older sister  slash colleague, Ate Tina. Hihihi ♥
