 Tona Khau, FMP, SFP is a Facilities Specialist for Sno-Isle Libraries in Seattle, WA where she is building a career as an emerging leader in the facilities management industry. Mike Petrusky asks Tona about how she has made FM a career of choice through her experience, training and by earning multiple industry-related credentials. Tona serves on the IFMA Seattle Chapter Board and the UW Advisory Board and she discusses trends in the industry and how workplace professionals have an opportunity to influence the success of their organizations by building a culture of collaboration. Mike and Tona talk about their involvement with IFMA and passing on their passion for FM to the next generation of workplace leaders, so it’s appropriate that this week’s edition of “podcast karaoke” features a song about never giving up on your dreams!
