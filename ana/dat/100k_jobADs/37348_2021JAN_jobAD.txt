 Give Yourself a Try 
 ‚ÄúHey Dad, My AIEEE rank is out. I am eligible for IIIT-Allahabad and I don‚Äôt wanna study there in Kota for one more year. I m ardent to get enrolled in this college..pleeeeeeeease.‚Äù 
 ‚ÄúBut Beta I think u should give one more try for IIT. It would b a proud moment for me when I will call myself as father of one more IITian.‚Äù 
 ‚ÄúBut Dad m not interested in wasting one more precious year of my life there in Kota. And what if I didn‚Äôt get selected in IIT even in my next attempt..?? ‚Äù 
 ‚ÄúHmmm. Beta I think you can do it coz I count on your potential. But if you are unwilling to repeat then I won‚Äôt force you. But in future don‚Äôt ponder over past and say ‚ÄòKash ek bar aur try kar liya hota‚Äô. I still insist you to have a try. But the ultimate choice is yours.‚Äù 
 ‚ÄúOh Thanks a lot Dad. I won‚Äôt let you down even in IIIT. In fact my institute is having one extra ‚ÄòI‚Äô than Bhaiya‚Äôs institute. So it isn‚Äôt that bad.‚Äù 
 My whole family was pressurizing me to repeat but somehow they got convinced by listening my somewhat senti senti stuff. I was happy like‚Ä¶.just wow. 
 This made me feel as if I had just won a battle and now area is clear in front of me. She was in my mind the whole time when I was talking with Dad. Its now only that she came to rest. I just thanked God for helping me to come one step closer to her. Now I will be lacking from her by just one class, and one step ahead to make my relation come true in coming future. But I didn‚Äôt tell her about my sacrifice. And she didn‚Äôt even bother to ask me the reason for such a strange decision regarding my whole career. I just don‚Äôt know I was mad or what but I was not feeling bad for suppressing my parent's wishes. Rather I was more happy to do a idiotic thing with my career and a good thing for her and our relation of which she was unaware. 
 But now when I ponder over those days I find myself as a crazy guy who kept a girl over his career and parents. And in fact crazy word doesn‚Äôt suits me instead. Fool suits better. Coz the present condition of mine proves me as fool. Now the girl for whom I took that step is not with me and she never mind how am I performing in academics. And my parents whom I ignored that time are standing with me with full support regarding my performance in academics and are happy for my happiness. 
 Now I feel ashamed of myself that how a girl can put that much impact on me for which I went against family and my own career. Now I just think ‚ÄúKash us waqt ek aur try kar liya hota‚Äù. And I still remember the words of my Dad-‚ÄùBeta I know you have the potential and don‚Äôt give yourself a chance to say Kash ek aur try‚Ä¶.‚Äù. 
 Words of my Dad were pounding in my head. And whenever I think of my past, his words make me realize my mistake of not taking them seriously. Now see where I am. Neither am I having the girl nor IIT. 
So finally I decided that its never too late to learn from your mistakes. And golden words of my dad were still playing major role in motivating me. I kept murmuring the whole day ‚ÄúYes Prat you have the potential and you must give yourself one more try‚Äù. 
 The very next day when I went to the college with my friend I asked him to take a look at a beautiful girl. But he started staring at her. 
I knocked him hard on his head and said ‚ÄúBhabhi hai teri. Izzat se dekh.‚Äù 
 Yes friends I am giving myself one more try and of course I know I have the potential‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
