 Lift Kits: A do-it-yourself job? 
 Posted on  March 31, 2016  by  performanceofgpt 
 Since off-roading is our goal, we've got to either turn our stock vehicle into off-road material ourselves or get a professional to do it. 
 A lift kit is the first place to start when upgrading your vehicle. An increase in the ride height of your truck will allow for mounting larger tires and the increase axle clearance will allow you to over things 
 What to know 
 Some lift kits for trucks may seem simple, and you might be tempted to not buy certain lift kit components, thinking you can do without them and ultimately half-ass the job. Making modifications without the required parts can be seriously disastrous. 
 Depending on how much room you have in your fenders, you might be able to jam some larger tires on without too much trouble. But without a lift kit, you're going to have some tire rubbing, which isnâ€™t good for the tires or the truck. 
 People do some  funny things  to make their vehicle off-road-capable like welding together U-bolt extensions, and not buying an extended brake line or engine case mount, or a longer driveshaft, etc. Please don't try to fashion your own parts to save a few dollars. Even basic lift kits include essential pieces like longer U-bolts and shock absorbers. 
 Long story short 
 Installing a lift kit means altering a lot of things. It's a drastic change. So,  all the components are important  to upgrade and make changes where needed. There are some things to do that are essential to the success of the job! 
 Rigging things arbitrarily  and skipping steps not only puts your safety in question, but also increases the likelihood of having to dish out more money to repair or replace broken components down the road. So if you're going to do it yourself, please do it right. You'll thank yourself in the long run. 
 The best way to go is to buy a  specific kit  for your truck and if you don't have a  replete  understanding of everything that needs to be done,  find a technician  who does.
