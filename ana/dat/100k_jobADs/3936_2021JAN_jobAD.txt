 In 2015, a team of young innovators started Playbrush with the aim of inspiring children to brush their teeth by making it fun. 
 Since then, the start-up company has become the innovation leader in Oral Care in Europe and beyond, not only fostering proper dental hygiene for children, but also for families and adults. The concept that they devised was called Playbrush, an interactive smart toothbrush that connects via Bluetooth to a smartphone or tablet. 
 So far Playbrush has received seven digit investments and closed partnerships with several multinationals, who are enthusiastic about the "Connected Health" trend. Playbrush has also won numerous awards like the Health Media Award in 2016 and the Gamification World Award 2015 in the "Best Technological Innovation" category, which reflect the success of the young company.
