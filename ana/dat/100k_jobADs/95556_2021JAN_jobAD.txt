 Frequently asked questions about the job fair 
 You may have some questions about the job fair and I will answer some of the more common ones below. 
 
 Do I have to attend the job fair the entire time? You are not required to attend the job fair for the entire duration. The hours are open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. to give as many people as possible time to connect virtually with these employers according to your own schedule. If you only have 15 minutes to spare, you are still welcome to join this free event. 
 Do I need to be disabled to attend the job fair? You do not have to be disabled or receive SSI or SSDI disability benefits in order to attend the job fair. 
 Are only work at home companies participating in the job fair? There will be work at home and brick and mortar companies participating in the job fair. 
 Will the job fair cost me anything? The job fair is free to register for and to attend. 
 Will I have to dress up? It is not a requirement but only a suggestion because you may video chat with an employer. This is your chance to give a good impression by wearing casual or business attire instead of pajamas. You may also want to give attention to your workspace and tidy it up before you enable your webcam. 
 Can I apply to work at home jobs without attending the job fair? Yes. You can do so by  clicking here  if you receive SSI or SSDI disability benefits and want to work from home. 
 
 Things to Remember 
 Please mark your calendars now so that you will not miss out on this free upcoming event to talk with employers especially if you earnestly want to work from home. Feel free to tell your friends and family about the job fair and have them register too. 
 
 Did you know that some of my blog readers have gotten hired just by attending a job fair? You could be the next one to get a work at home job from this free job fair. Don't forget to register for  free here .
