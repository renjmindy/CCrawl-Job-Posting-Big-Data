  How to Keep Your Career Resolutions  
 Chrissy Scivicque 
 January 20, 2012 
 Did you know the most common New Year’s resolutions have to do with health, wealth and  career ? If you made a resolution to get a better job, or make more money, or just enjoy work a little more, you’re in good company. Sadly, statistics tell us you’ve probably already forgotten about that wonderfully exciting career resolution. According to research, at least half of those who made a New Year’s resolution gave up within less than a week. That same data tells us, by February, the other half will have forgotten their resolution as well. I hate to sound so negative, but you can’t argue with math. The good news is you CAN fight it. You don’t have to be a statistic. You can be different. You can actually  keep  your career resolution. Even if you’ve  never kept a New Year’s resolution  before, you’re not doomed for life. There’s no reason you have to let your career goals for 2012 slip away like they have in the past. Remember that feeling you had on December 31? The excitement with which you entered the New Year? Let’s get that back. Let’s reignite your resolutions—and make them happen. Wanna know how? Join me for a FREE webinar!  5 Tips to Help You Keep Your Career Resolutions  During this one-hour session, you’ll learn: 
 
 Why career resolutions are the MOST important to keep (and the hardest!) 
 The reasons most resolutions fall apart by February 
 How to tweak your resolution so you’re better equipped for success 
 The five things you MUST do to make sure you keep your resolution
