 Careers At Southill 
 **** 
 Full Time Veterinary Surgeon 
 A great opportunity has arisen to join our team as we say a sad goodbye to a treasured vet as he retires from the practice after 37 years with us! We hope our next team member will have experience as some sole charge may be required on occasion, and a surgical bias is a big plus! However, if you would prefer some support for those few GDVs we see then help is always at hand. 
 WE 
 
 
 Are an independent, nurse training practice with 4 branches on the South Somerset/Dorset/Wiltshire borders 
 
 
 Provide a good work/life balance with a 4 day week, fairly shared OOHs and 6pm finishes. Saturdays are morning consults only. 
 
 
 Offer a friendly, supportive environment, like to discuss our cases and have a collaborative approach to problem solving 
 
 
 Provide our own OOH to our own clients only 
 
 
 Have NO selling targets and our vets have complete clinical freedom and ability to work up their own cases 
 
 
 Have a visiting specialist orthopaedic service 
 
 
 Offer 5 weeks holiday including Bank Holidays (pro rata) 
 
 
 Support and encourage CPD in your areas of interest, including funding for certificates
