  Didn't Get Job, What Should Go in Thank-You Note?  
 Work It Daily 
 July 13, 2009 
 Dear Experts, I had an interview one day and the other candidates were all interviewed within 2 days, so I found out I didn't get the job right before I was going to write the thank you note. Are there any particular details that should be included in a thank you note/follow up even after you've been rejected?  Here is how our T.A.P. experts answered this question:   Q#201  Advice: Great idea to send a note - just thank them for opportunity and ask them to keep you in mind for future. ( @louise_fletcher )  Q#201  Just be gracious and thank them for the opportunity. You never know who you might come across again in the future. ( @gradversity )  Q#201  Exp cont'd interest in company & desire 2 interview 4 other similar positions as they arise. Ref. appropriate skills. ( @DebraWheatman )  Q#201  Be even more courteous than normal. Who knows, maybe the other person will back out or something! ( @beneubanks )  Q#201  Thx 4 oppty 2 intrvw & lrn abt co, sorry 2 lrn job filled, hope u keep me in mind, I'd luv 2 add value. ( @juliaerickson )  Q#201  Thank them for their time, express continued interest. Then, if you really want a job there, build a relationship w/in. ( @tmonhollon )  Q#201  Highlight skills they need, reiterate interest & ask for future consideration. (PS Thank you=next day) ( @dawnbugni )  Q#201  Send thank u note even if u didn't get job. Follow up 2 ask 4 referral. Mgr may no someone hiring. ( @kgrantcareers )  Q#201  Also, include quick note about your relevant skill set to co-one last chance to present your value. ( @teenarose )  Q#201  Thank u note is sweet even though you didn't land job. Thank interviewer for time; ask rez be kept on file.
