 Analytical Production Planner needed for a manufacturer in Birmingham who smashed their July sales budget and have moved strongly into August. 
 My client is a privately-owned precision manufacturing business with a rich history and an exciting future, based in Marston Green in Birmingham. A small-batch manufacturer of a market-leading range of products, this family-owned business appointed a new Managing Director and tasked him with reorganising, reenergising and growing their historically successful business, bringing modern and innovative thinking in order to take it into the next phase of its history. 
 The successful Production Planner will have a background within batch production in any manufacturing sector. You naturally have a highly analytical mind and have developed advanced Excel skills, both required due to the complex nature of production. With no two days being the same you will enjoy working in a fast-paced, dynamic environment where the plan is critical to meet customer orders, as is working with agility within that plan. 
 The company are looking for a career-minded candidate who takes pride in their work and cares about making a difference within the organisation and with its' customers. 
 The successful candidate will receive a salary up to £35,000 plus benefits. The organisation is moving forward with pace and as a result, career progression opportunities exist for talented & hardworking people. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
