 WORK AT HOME JOBS WITH BENEFITS UPDATED MAY 2018 
 Most people who ask me about legitimate work at home jobs want employment that pays a great salary and offers benefits. Unfortunately, one of the reasons many companies offer telecommuting jobs is to save money, so they hire contractors without benefits. With that said, there are many companies that offer benefits and other perks along with working at home. Here's a list of 25 companies that often offer benefits. These jobs vary from customer service, technical support, sales, claims, recruiting and more. 
 NOTE: Like all employers, these companies are looking for people to fill specific jobs. In other words, you can't just sign up and start working. You'll need to have skills and experience the company needs. Also: 
 
 N  ot all jobs listed on the companies ' sites may be done from home. You may need to search the site's job openings for those that allow for working at home. 
 Not all jobs listed on the company 's site may provide benefits. For example, part-time employment (less than 30 or 35 hours a week) may not include benefits. 
 These companies may or may not have work-at-home options with benefits available at this time. Check back with the sites regularly to see if new job openings are posted. 
 They may require you to pay for the background check before hiring you.
