 Flash Fiction: You had one job! 
 Flash Fiction: You had one job! 
 July 2, 2017  by  Ameena k.g 
 "  Come in ",  Leslie answered from behind her desk without lifting her gaze up. 
The door was pushed softly and in walked Tony, in his usual black tee, jeans and bandanna. 
 " You sent for me boss? " Tony asked, a broad smile on his face. 
 She looked up, dropped her pen and folded her hands across the table. 
_ "Yes I did."_ Leslie replied curtly. 
 "  Does this look like an alternate universe to you  ", she began, without necessarily waiting for an answer. _ "where gnomes go around chasing aliens for the entertainment of humans while we cheer them on"_ 
 The smile on Tony's face faded. 
 " You only had one job Tony,"  Leslie continued, "  get me a cover picture that would surprise me and stun the readers. And you decided of all the excitement of this universe to supply me with the shot of an alien and a gnome! " 
 Tony knew the only thing he could do was apologise, which he did. 
"Sorry?" She echoed his apology, "  well sorry for yourself! "  she replied, hurling the picture at him.

 Oh no! The boss, Leslie isn't very happy with Tony's cover picture! Hopefully, he won't be fired because at least, he tried! Great story, Ameena!

 Sometimes you try something out and think it works, only to find out from the "boss" that you made a terrible mistake. Hopefully, he will get another chance to impress the boss. I can see this sort of thing happening in real life.

 I think he will. True JC, we all make similar mistakes if not worse. I can see a second chance in his work. But probably after the boss cools off for a while üòÑ
