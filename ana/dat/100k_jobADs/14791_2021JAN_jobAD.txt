  5 Tips For Creating A Successful Career In Art  
 Michael B. Curie 
 October 21, 2016 
 The pool of talented individuals is dramatically increasing these days, and the competition for jobs is expected to be keen. Being competent artist isn’t a magic wand. Determination, hard work, persistence, and hard selling are what it takes to stand out. **RELATED : ** Career Transition: From Artist to Art Teacher  Becoming a professional artist can be exciting and challenging at times. After learning the  artists career  information, it is time to take a peek at some of the helpful tips for a successful career in art. 
 
 1. Take advantage of social media 
 It is possible to get a career in arts but selling yourself or your artwork is really tough. Social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn are some of the best places to promote your art and when people find it stunning, they will start to talk about it. Additionally, when you are looking for work, words will easily spread like fire and people might recommend you. 
 2. Allow multitasking 
 Due to the stiff competition in both salaried and self-employed jobs in the art world, artists find it difficult to earn enough money by only selling their artwork. Multitasking is important in the existence of many artists. While you work in a certain company, you can make use of your spare time by working as a freelance in another firm. Applying for awards and residencies are also helpful in broadening your network and raising your profile. 
 3. Keep a calendar of events 
 If you are planning to  sell your artwork  or get noticed, sitting on your room may not be the best option for you. Although browsing on the Internet and promoting yourself and your artwork is useful, still you need to go outside and see the real art world. Know and keep track of the important dates for auctions, fairs, and exhibitions and try to be present to as many of them. This offers a higher chance of getting noticed and earns profit. 
 4. Build an impressive portfolio 
 A portfolio shows evidence of your talent and skill. It is a collection of hand-made, computer-generated, photographic, or printed samples of the artist’s artwork. No matter how seasoned artist you are, it will be difficult to find recognition for your work whether it is from an employer or a gallery. A portfolio is a great way to back up your talent. Employers and gallery owners don’t have the time to research on how great you are and your artwork. There is a big difference between a portfolio and a resume. A resume is intended to showcase your educational background and work experiences while portfolio is intended to show off your ability in a certain field or art. 
 5. Apply for a job effectively 
 Just like selling your art, landing for a job is quite hard in the art world. If you are just emailing your resume and portfolio to random organizations, then you may need to reconsider your strategies. Learn to pick up the phone and be direct, check if you can speak to the director of the art agency and confidently introduce yourself. Explain how you would like to work in their organization and ask if there are any available positions for you. When you have learned the basics of an artist’s career information, you will find yourself confident in selling yourself and your artwork.  This is a guest post.
