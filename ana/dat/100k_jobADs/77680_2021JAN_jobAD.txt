  The Most Important Steps In The Job Search Process (That You Might Be Forgetting)  
 George Bernocco 
 October 28, 2013 
 Job search encompasses a lot of dedicated time and effort to obtain that ideal job. The saying goes that looking for a job is a full-time job, and it is exhausting. That’s when cutting corners comes in, when being burned out may cause an excellent candidate to miss an opportunity. You may overlook deciding to research about the companies you are applying for, and figure if they call you back you can research later. 
 
 The Most Important Steps In The Job Search Process Are... 
 ...researching your target company in a few different ways. Researching an employer before, during and after applying is crucial to the job application process because of the impression it gives the employer about you and your work. The information you receive will not only give you guidance but could also land you the job for showing how much you care about the job opening and (more importantly) the business. Here are some places and people to gather information from during your research: 
 Company Website 
 Most companies create a corporate website in today’s technological age. The first instinct that a job seeker may have is to skip right to the “Careers” section and start applying. Instead, try starting in the “About Us” section. Any company personnel reviewing resumes, or interviewing candidates, holds the expectation that you have read the information in this section. “  Company, Inc. is one of the leading fashion design and marketing studios in the world. It designs and markets women’s and men’s designer collection apparel and a range of other products that are manufactured and marketed through an extensive network of licensing agreements and other arrangements worldwide.”  A cover letter statement that would complement the above company information would be: “  My resume will demonstrate my extensive experience as a worldwide fashion designer. I believe I can be an asset to Company, Inc., one of the leading fashion design and marketing studios in the world.”  Companies often have mottos, or slogans, that are usually involved in some sort of sales pitch to obtain clients and demonstrate a company goal. These phrases are found on their website or even commercials. When you explain how you can contribute to their company goal using their self-created image, you’ve demonstrated that you’ve done your research. 
 Company Insiders 
 Networking is crucial to finding employment as a contact can provide you with a job lead before posted publicly. A contact can also give you information about the company culture so you are better prepared during an interview. Knowing someone who works (or worked) for a company you are interested in is not always easy. However, today’s digital age provides us with social networking tools (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter) to connect with individuals. More and more employers are creating accounts on these social media sites that can provide more information about the company. 
 Search Engines 
 Typing an employer’s name into a search engine can provide you with an idea about the company’s detailed history, new articles or reviews about performance which can help complete a picture for your job search. You may find negative information that may discourage you to apply as well. Just remember to take everything you’ve learned about the business as a whole and try not to focus on individual sites or content. 
 ALSO: Don't forget to check the company's financial status. 
 Is the business making money or on the economic decline? Obtaining a company’s recent financial history is important to know if you’ll be there for a long term career, or just a job. A constant economic decline may signal a worse fate for the company and may not be the type of investment to which you are willing to commit. You can possibly obtain financial information about the employer through newspapers, business websites or even the stock market. Completing the research aspect of job search involves a lot of reading and analyzing data. When a job seeker sacrifices information gathering to apply for more jobs, it will signal to the employer that you’re not really interested in the opportunity. The interviewer will ask why you are applying for this company, and when you provide a detailed response about corporate mentality and business goals, you stand out as a viable candidate. Combining thorough research with all of the other job search steps, you can make yourself a front-runner for whatever positions you apply for.  Enjoy this article?
