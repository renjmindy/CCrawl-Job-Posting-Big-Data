 I’m a Nurse in New York. Teachers Should Do Their Jobs, Just Like I Did (Kristin McConnell) 
 Kristin McConnell is a nurse and writer living in New York City. This appeared  in  The Atlantic  online Augus t 4, 2020. 
 The other day my husband, a public-school teacher in New York City, got a string of texts from a work friend. After checking in on our family and picking up their ongoing conversation about books and TV shows, she wrote, “So, are we going on a teacher strike in the fall?” 
 “What!? No!” My husband is adamantly against a strike, because he understands on a deep, personal level his duty to serve his country in the classroom. 
 We have two young children, one of whom is developmentally disabled, and I’m an intensive-care nurse. Through the spring, I took care of COVID-19 patients at the hospital while he toggled between teaching on Zoom and helping our daughters through their own lessons. He knows that I did my part for society, and that now he should, too. 
 We wouldn’t be in this mess of uncertainty about the coming school year if the federal government had managed to control the virus; any glimmer of leadership from the president would have gone a long way. Grievances and fear are understandable. I support teacher-led campaigns to make sure that safety measures are in place. And any city or state experiencing a spike in cases should keep schools shut, along with indoor businesses. 
 What I don’t support is preemptively threatening “safety strikes,” as the American Federation of Teachers did in late July. These threats run counter to the fact that, by and large, school districts are already fine-tuning social-distancing measures and mandating mask-wearing. Teachers are not being asked to work without precautions, but some overlook this: the politics of mask-wearing have gotten so ridiculous that many seem to believe masks only protect other people, or are largely symbolic. They’re not. Nurses and doctors know that masks do a lot to keep us safe, and that other basics such as hand-washing and social distancing are effective at preventing the spread of the coronavirus. 
 nstead of taking the summer to hone arguments against returning to the classroom, administrators and teachers should be thinking about how they can best support children and their families through a turbulent time. Schools are essential to the functioning of our society, and that makes teachers essential workers. They should rise to the occasion even if it makes them nervous, just like health-care workers have. 
 My husband, playing devil’s advocate while we discussed this (we both know how eager he is to go back), said, “Arguably health-care workers sort of signed up for this kind of risk, but teachers did not.” 
 I replied, “Absolutely not!” Doctors and nurses sign up for work that is sometimes high-stress for us and sometimes life-or-death for our patients, not for us. Aside from those who choose to work in biocontainment or offer their services in war zones, we are  not  expected to do crucial medical work under potentially lethal circumstances. 
 I was terrified when I started taking care of COVID-19 ICU patients. Before my first COVID-19 shift, I had panic attacks that made me wheeze, and I walked onto the unit my first day in tears (so in addition to being terrified, I was also really embarrassed). My co-workers felt similarly. I heard an attending physician say, of her daughter, “What if she loses her mother?” and I read through a young nurse’s freshly written will, no joke. 
 In those early days, I confessed my anxieties to an acquaintance, and he asked whether I could take a medical leave of absence. I  could  have taken a leave, and teachers in need can too. (And parents who want their children to stay home have that option, whether through homeschooling or continued remote learning.) But I said, "No, I can't just chump out!"  Chump  wasn't the right word—at the moment, I was almost hysterical, and it was hard for me to even articulate how I felt, called upon to do something frightening and hard that I viscerally did not want to do. 
 The military language people used when discussing COVID-19 in the spring seemed totally appropriate, and in a way that mentality got me through the peak: This was a war, and I was a soldier. It wasn't my choice to serve, but it was my duty; I had skills and knowledge that were needed 
 So I can understand that teachers are nervous about returning to school. But they should take a cue from their fellow essential workers and do their job. Even people who think there’s a fundamental difference between a nurse and a teacher in a pandemic must realize that there isn’t one between a grocery-store worker and a teacher, in terms of obligation. People who work at grocery stores in no way signed up to expose themselves to disease, but we expected them to go to work, and they did. If they had not, society would have collapsed. What do teachers think will happen if working parents cannot send their children to school? Life as we know it simply will not go on. 
 When some of my husband’s students told him that they had continued working as cashiers throughout the spring and summer, he said, “Wow, that’s so courageous of you.” He feels that he doesn’t really have anything to show for himself, and he looks forward to the time when he will. Now, contemplating the possibility of teachers striking, he says, “Bowing out wouldn’t be a good example to set for our students.” 
 Teachers signed up to be a positive adult presence in children’s lives, and to help them grow up with their peers, at school, away from home. We need them to follow through, even though it’s a challenge. It’s going to be hard; it’s going to be stressful; it’s not going to be perfect. “I can’t think of one time that there was actually hand soap in the men’s bathroom,” my husband told me. That’ll have to change, hopefully for good. The point is that everyone is going to have to go above and beyond. But teachers are smart and adaptable. They can do this. 
 In the days before I first took care of COVID-19 patients, I discovered a deeper fear. Beneath my panic over exposing myself to the disease, I was also afraid that the work would be too difficult, too fast-paced, too chaotic: I was afraid I would fail. When I came to the hospital, I discovered that solidarity, flexibility, kindness, and a willingness to learn would be integral elements of nursing through a pandemic, and I knew I wouldn’t fail—the skills I had were the very reason I had been called upon to do this work. The same is true of teaching through a pandemic.

 I can't believe she wrote this essay. To assume that all schools can even approach a level of safety commensurate with the risk is incredibly naive if not just plain ignorant. Across the country, schools, particularly in economically challenged communities, have been underfunded for decades. The stories already being shared of Covid-19 spread through school communities should be enough for her to rethink her rebuke of those who aren't ready to put themselves, their students, and all of their families at risk in communities where the virus is far from under control and the safeguards are woefully inadequate.

 I have a feeling she was writing about the school she knows, her husband's, and not all schools and teachers nation-wide. If a school is not doing everything it can do to reasonably protect the students and teachers then there is reason to get upset. So many want to point at the boob in the Whitehouse and the Federal government and blame them for not solving their problems. Solve your problems yourself. Masks, distancing and washing your hands a lot do not require the Federal government and do not require a huge budget increase. Distancing can be an issue but it has to be solved by the people on the spot. Extra space is not going to magically appear. As a veteran of two wars I feel wearing a mask is so much easier to do than wearing body armor in 120 degree heat. They both can save lives.

 The Atlantic was probably not the right place to express her opinion if her concerns were directed at her immediate schools in NYC. In this instance, Trump has little to do with the infrastructure problems in schools since that is a state and local issue. It would be a relatively easy fix if all we had to do was wear masks and wash our hands (if there is soap and running water in the bathrooms) and everyone maintains social distancing protocols. How many classrooms have you seen that would allow 25(+) kids to stay six feet apart? Didn't a high school student get suspended recently for posting a photo of the crowded conditions in the halls of her high school? The countries that have reopened their schools successfully have met very strict metrics on the number of Covid cases. When a school system can demonstrate the same and follow all of the recommendations for safe reopening and continued operation of schools, then I agree with her that reopening makes sense. We cannot expect to eliminate all risk, but we should demand that we limit it. It is obvious from the daily news that we meet the necessary standards in few venues.

 There is a large difference between a grocery store worker, a nurse and a teacher. I am surrounded by 400+ people in the building every single moment at work. Closer to me, I am within 6ft of 30 people at a time every minute except my lunch period, unless someone needs help with classwork. Grocery workers are not surrounded by that many every moment. 
Nurses have higher grade PPE and an environment aimed at stopping the spread of germs including ventilation and UV devices. My 50 year old school has limited fresh air and no UV disinfection. And my "clients" will resist wearing masks in my conservative area. 
Along that same line of thought, my school is not doing what is necessary. There is a refusal to do a hybrid so only 1/2 the students are there at any one time. There are no plans for reducing hall traffic released, and we start in 2 weeks. We have, however, explored options to live stream football games!

 I am an NP in NYC. Comparing the controlled environment of the MICU and the hospital in general to the classroom is completely unfair. Healthcare workers have lower infection rates than the general population because we now upfront what we are dealing with and how to mitigate risk. The classroom can be like the wild Wild West. 
I am a nurse practitioner who fully supports all teachers and respect their choice to protect themselves from Covid however they chose to do so.

 What do you think, Dr. Cuban? Should schools open this fall?

 Where incidence of infections is low and safety measures have been vetted and put into place (with teacher input), and if parents are willing to send their children into buildings for face-to-face instruction-yes, schools should open. Thanks for question, John.
