 You may be thinking of making your next career move. If you want to make that move successfully, it's important to know which of your strengths to play to. So, how exactly do you find that out? 
 "You are a business-of-one. If you think of yourself as a business-of-one, any good business has a clear sense of what their strengths are and what they should be marketing about themselves.
