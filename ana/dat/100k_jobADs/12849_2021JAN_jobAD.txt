 ABOUT LEGALSIFTER 
 LegalSifter makes contracts easier. We have two primary products: 
 
 
 LegalSifter : Artificial intelligence software that reads a contract and gives advice before a client signs, reducing risk, lowering cost, and saving time. 
 
 
 Sifter Concierge : A contract librarian service that organizes contracts for clients using artificial intelligence software, paralegals, and attorneys.?? 
 
 
 We build simple, affordable artificial intelligence products embedded with expertise. We are doing this to make global legal support affordable. We want to empower people with artificial intelligence, not replace them. 
 OUR MISSION 
 To bring affordable legal services to the world by empowering people with artificial intelligence. 
 OUR CORE VALUES 
 
 
 Speed: We work fast. 
 
 
 Security: We are vigilant and committed to maintaining the privacy of client data. 
 
 
 Humility: We use our energy to serve others; we are lifelong learners. 
 
 
 Intelligence: We operate with aligned visions, strategies, plans, and budgets. 
 
 
 Boldness: We are transparent, courageous, and unafraid to make mistakes. 
 
 
 Balance: We work flexibly to keep promises to teammates, shareholders, clients, friends, and family. 
 
 
 OUR STRATEGY 
 We sell our products directly to companies and law firms that are interested in improving their efficiencies, lowering their risk, and improving the quality in their contract processes. We also work with law firms to combine their legal advice with our artificial intelligence to create co-branded contract review software that law firm clients buy directly from the law firm. Law firms increase revenues, expand margins, and make their clients happier with more affordable legal products. We also work with contract lifecycle management software companies to provide contract librarian services to their clients who are dissatisfied because they cannot organize their contracts. 
 ABOUT THE JOB 
 Contracts are the most important document in global commerce. They are also universally a pain. They slow down commerce. People cannot afford to send them to attorneys, because they are too expensive and too slow for the average transaction. Attorneys cannot afford to review them faster or cheaper because they have not had the technology that allows them to deliver contract reviews at scale. Moreover, once contracts are signed, the world cannot keep track of them. It buys databases, and then struggles to keep them organized. Everyone builds a library, but the books are in a mess on the floor. 
 LegalSifter is growing quickly, and we need someone to join or team as a senior software engineer on our software engineering team, working collaboratively with our Data Science team. We have a team of top-notch software engineers. We are looking for someone to help us consistently deliver the kind of world-beating product outcomes that we all signed up for when we joined this venture. Success in this role will require technical excellence as follows:
