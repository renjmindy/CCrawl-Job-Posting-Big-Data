The Coolest Second Jobs of Famous People 
 Sometimes even the most successful among us take on a side hustle. 
 The Coolest Second Jobs of Famous People 
 While many famous actors, musicians and athletes are content to focus on their careers, several just can't be contained by one profession. They've channeled their creativity and drive into unusual second jobs or side hustles. 
 Some, like David Lee Roth, who worked as an emergency medical technician in New York City, prefer to do their secondary work anonymously. Others, like Gwen Stefani or George Clooney, use their fame to drive sales of their products. 
 These second gigs are often inspired by what the person trained to do originally, studied in school or developed as an outside interest. Here's a list of 14 famous people and their intriguing side hustles. 
 Bono and The Edge, Hoteliers 
 The creative forces behind the Irish rock band U2 sideline as hoteliers. 
 In 1992, the pair - as part of a consortium - bought the  Clarence Hotel  in Dublin. Bono and The Edge invested millions in renovating the hotel and offsetting financial losses. 
 While the Clarence Hotel lost money during the financial downturn, it is now profitable again. In 2013, Bono and The Edge stepped down as company directors but still maintain ownership. 
 David Lee Roth, Emergency Medical Technician 
 David Lee Roth, the 1980s rock icon, is best known as the lead singer for the band Van Halen. He is also an author. In 1998, he published a memoir, "Crazy from the Heat," which became a New York Times bestseller. 
 But Roth's most interesting slideline was his stint as an emergency medical technician (EMT). Before joining Van Halen, he had worked as a surgical orderly. In 2004, Roth received his certification as an EMT and worked in New York City for two years before returning full-time to hosting a radio show and playing music. 
 Soleil Moon Frye, Children’s Clothing/Party Decorations Entrepreneur

She's also done some Hollywood-adjacent work, hosting a podcast and web series on women's rights and raising kids, and she has written books on parenting and party planning. 
 In 2007, she went a different direction. Frye opened an eco-friendly children's clothing shop in Los Angeles. Now a wholly online business, Little Seed produces clothing made from organic cotton and low-impact dyes for infants and children.

 Clooney's also a tequila mogul. 
 Clooney and friend Rande Gerber established Casamigos, an award-winning tequila that is one of the fastest-growing brands in the world. Clooney's fame helped boost sales for the company. Last year, Casamigos was bought by global retailer Diageo, for $1 billion. Despite the sale, Clooney and Gerber are still involved with the business, and taste every batch before bottling. 
 Tom Selleck, Avocado Farmer 
 The television actor, best known for his role as Thomas Magnum in the hit series, "Magnum, P.I.," currently stars in the TV police drama "Blue Bloods." 
 Selleck doubles as a commercial avocado farmer, with 2,100 trees on his 60-acre ranch in California. Selleck works the farm himself, saying that the physical activity is a good antidote to the stress of his on-screen life. 
 Erykah Badu, Doula 
 The Grammy-winning singer and songwriter, record producer, DJ and actress is known for her unique style that combines jazz, funk, R&B and hip-hop. Her second gig is a little bit different.

Badu is a spokesperson for the International Center for Traditional Childbearing and is working towards her certification as a midwife. Once she's qualified, Badu hopes to open inner-city birthing centers for women of color.
