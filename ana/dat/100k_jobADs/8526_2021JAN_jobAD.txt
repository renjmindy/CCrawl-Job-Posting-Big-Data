 Well Done 
 God doesn't do things half way or half hearted. God is all in. God is all in all the time. 
 God sent Jesus, the Messiah, to finish what had been started. Jesus completed God's assignment. Nothing has been left undone. 
 God's goal for me is to do the job and do it well. God wants me to be all in. 
 
 Look out! God’s hurricane is let loose, 
his hurricane blast, 
Spinning the heads of the wicked like dust devils! 
God’s raging anger won’t let up 
Until he’s made a clean sweep 
completing the job he began. 
When the job’s done 
you’ll see it’s been well done.

 How do we increase our chances for wisdom? 
 Is Jesus preeminent in everything? 
 What does the gentleness of Jesus the Messiah look like?  
 Why does Jesus provoke us to scorn? 
 Is Jesus going to accuse us before God? 
 Is being angry helpful? What does God think about that? 
 What happens when we put our faith in our experiences? 
 What should we do about what God wants? 
 Will we go when God calls? Are we ready? 
 Why would the meek inherit the earth?
