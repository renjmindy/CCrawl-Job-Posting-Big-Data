 Job: Director of Online Librarians 
 Posted on  January 29, 2015  by   sarahgprescott 
 1/28/15 -  Director of Online Librarians 
American Public University System (APUS), USA 
 Sarah P’s comments  : APU was founded in 1991 to offer online degrees to the US Armed Forces. The reviews from students and faculty are generally positive and they seem to be a growing organization. I think this could be a great opportunity to develop virtual librarianship while giving you the freedom to travel. FYI: Last fall three positions were listed, one senior online librarian, one online librarian, one part-time online librarian.
