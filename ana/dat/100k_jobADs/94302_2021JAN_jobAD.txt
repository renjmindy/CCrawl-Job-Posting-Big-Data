 Website (Easy) 
 Published: 2 hours ago  Bids: 6 
 Hi! I want to quickly set up a website for a real estate consultant company. I want something VERY simple (see example1).  This project shouldn't take longer than 6 hours (the example website my old guy did within 4 hours). 
 Pictures can be taken for google and the different tabs I want is only the following ones: 
- Home 
- Consultant service: For example(Sales & Marketing, Strategy, Customer Experience) 
- About Us 
- Case study 
- Partners 
- Contact 
 
 Inspirational website 
 
 
 http://www.realestateconsultancy.co.uk/ 
 https://www.stratosphere-ltd.com/ 
 
 I mainly want the website to be good enough for a quick over view. I need the website to be done within Wednesday/Thursday. 
 Example1:  https://www.stratosphere-ltd.com/ 
Example2:  https://www.bain.com/industry-expertise/infrastructure-construction-building-products/real-estate/ 
 For more information text me.
