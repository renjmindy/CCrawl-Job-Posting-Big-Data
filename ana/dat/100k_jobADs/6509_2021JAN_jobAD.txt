 HOUSTON, USA. Blogger and professional troll Dan Graur is considering a career in scientific research,  The ScienceWeb  has learned. 
 Judge Graur became famous in 2013 for his paper claiming to have discovered  the genetic basis for television encoded within the human genome . Despite (or perhaps because of) his wild claims, Graur received wide-spread criticism for his use of the phrase "Television Sets", a term last used in the 1950s. 
 Graur is perhaps best known for his  blog  where he trolls scientists, waiting for them to appear so that he can inject venom to slow their hearts, prior to wrapping them in a silk coccoon and eating them at his leisure. 
 Bored with trolling,  The ScienceWeb  has learned that Graur is considering a career in academic science, most often the target of his anger. "They make so many mistakes" said Graur "so this shit should be easy for an intellectual diplodocus such as I" he continued.
