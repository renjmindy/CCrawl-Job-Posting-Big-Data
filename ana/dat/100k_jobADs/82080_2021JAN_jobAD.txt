 Jesus has given me a job. There are things He wants me to do. I have to decide, will I be obedient and complete the tasks. 
 I want to but will I? 
 
 My job is to speak out. But not just about any old silly thing. I must speak out for solid doctrine. 
 
 I need to live a life of temperance, dignity, and wisdom, in healthy faith, love, and endurance. I must have reverence so I don't end up as a gossip or drunk, but a model of goodness. 
 I must focus on how to love my spouse and children, on how to be virtuous and pure, keeping a good house and being a good husband. 
 I don’t want anyone looking down on God’s Message because of my behavior. 
 I must live a disciplined life. 
 That is what God wants. That is the goal. 
 Goal

 Excellent message, Michael! How we live our life as believers impacts others. Sometimes we become so wrapped up in ourselves we forget that.

 I work with many professed believers (in solid doctrine churches on paper) but if you were to guess what they believed by their actions and speech, it would not be solid doctrine. There are a couple though, when they speak, people listen. Preach it Michael!

 Very good counsel. How easy it is to behave in a manner that might drive one from Christ instead of to Him.

 Micheal, 
 Every day I read the newspaper about a bunch of people who are lucky to have stumbled on a fumble or gift in a game, nd are running to the wrong goal or the wrong side of the field. 
 Regards and goodwill blogging.

 What is worry? Do we know God? Do we know how God works? 
 
   
 
 What is the proper response to God as His covenant people? Is it faithfulness?
