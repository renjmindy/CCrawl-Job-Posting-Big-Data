 My Top 50 Horror Films 
 So, articles like the one you're about to read are actually one of the biggest reasons that I decided to start blogging in the first place. I love reading Top 10 (or more) lists about all sorts of stuff, but I always get frustrated that a lot of the stuff that I enjoy the most either are low in the lists, or not there at all. And the top spots are often reserved for the same old "classics", most of which I don't like. After reading the millionth Top Horror Movies article with movies like  The Shining, Halloween, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Suspiria  and others in the top spots, I decided that I'd make my own blog where I can show people that there are other movies than those in the world, and they're just as good (or better, even) than those so-called classics. 
 I also won't be putting them in exact order, because I just don't have the patience to sit there and sort them all. I also doubt that I could choose a definitive order to put them in. So what I'll do is kind of make it a Top 5, each number having a 10-way tie. And those 10 won't be in any order, either. So with that said,  allons-y !! ðŸ˜€ 
 NUMBERS 5 
 
 Title:   Cube 
 Released in:  1997 
 Starring:  Maurice Dean Wint, Nicole de Boer, David Hewlett, Nicky Guadagni, Andrew Miller, and Julian Richings 
 Directed by:  Vincenzo Natali 
 Written by:  AndrÃ© Bijelic, Vincenzo Natali, and Graeme Manson 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  Seven strangers awaken to find themselves captive in what seems like an endless cubic maze, each door leading either to safety or a gruesome death. 
 Why I Love It:  A brilliant, character driven film that doesn't shy away from the atrocities that humanity is capable of in a survival of the fittest kind of environment. And while there are a few gruesome scenes when the prisoners accidentally enter a booby trapped room, the film never goes too far with it. Nothing like buckets of pointless gore to ruin a great film. 
 
 Title:   Jeepers Creepers 
 Released in:  2001 
 Starring:  Gina Philips, Justin Long, Jonathan Breck, Patricia Belcher, Brandon Smith, and Eileen Brennan 
 Directed by:  Victor Salva 
 Written by:  Victor Salva 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  Siblings Darry and Trish are driving home together from school when they are followed and attacked by a humanoid creature driving a big, rusty truck who wants to eat them to regenerate its own body parts. 
 Why I Love It:  It's a slightly ridiculous concept with sometimes shaky acting, but the visuals and effects are great, the villain is suitably creepy, and the whole film just gives off a vibe of great fun. It's not very scary (to me anyways), but it's always a good time. 
 
 Title:   Re-Animator 
 Released in:  1985 
 Starring:  Jeffrey Combs, Bruce Abbott, Barbara Crampton, David Gale, and Robert Sampson 
 Directed by:  Stuart Gordon 
 Written by:  Dennis Paoli, William Norris, and Stuart Gordon 
 Based On:   Herbert West, Re-Animator  by HP Lovecraft 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  A young medical student finds himself in over his head when new student Herbert West arrives with his experiments. Experiments to bring dead flesh back to life. 
 Why I Love It:  This film is totally nuts, start to finish, but it's got that 80's horror charm, and Jeffrey Combs is electrifying, eating up the whole screen every time he's on it. The film also boasts the most uncomfortable-to-watch "sex" scene in the history of film. You'll spend most of the film not knowing whether to laugh or cringe, but that's just part of the appeal of this classic gem. 
 
 Title:   Saw 
 Released in:  2004 
 Starring:  Cary Elwes, Leigh Whannell, Danny Glover, Ken Leung, Dina Meyer, Monica Potter, and Shawnee Smith 
 Directed by:  James Wan 
 Written by:  Leigh Whannell 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  Two men wake up in an almost empty room, each chained by the foot on opposite ends of the room, with a dead man sprawled on the ground between them. A cassette player informs them that to escape one must kill the other, or saw their own foot off with a provided jigsaw. 
 Why I Love It:  When it first came out,  Saw  was unlike anything the horror genre had seen in a long time, a real breath of fresh air. It was a wonderful idea, and very well executed, with only a little shaky acting sometimes. Unfortunately, with all the sequels that came after, the  Saw  name became synonymous with "crap", and the brilliance of the first film became lost in the sea of awful sequels. 
 
 Title:   The Crazies 
 Released in:  2010 
 Starring:  Timothy Olyphant, Radha Mitchell, Joe Anderson, Danielle Panabaker, Christie Lynn Smith, Brett Rickaby, and John Aylward 
 Directed by:  Breck Eisner 
 Written by:  Scott Kosar & Ray Wright 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  Yes 
 Of what?:  Remake of 1973's  The Crazies  , directed by George A Romero and starring Lane Carroll 
 5 Second Synopsis:  After having their water contaminated, inhabitants of a small town become infected by a virus that makes them incredibly, mindlessly homicidal. 
 Why I Love It:  Despite its rather silly name, this is a great film. I'm not much of a zombie movie fan, so I was reluctant to watch this one, but I was really glad I finally did. It may be classed as a zombie film, but besides a few similarities to the genre, it's thankfully quite different. No dead people shambling around trying to eat flesh, this film is tense and sometimes scary, with great acting and awesome effects. This isn't your grandfather's zombie film :-p 
 
 Title:   The Pit & the Pendulum 
 Released in:  1991 
 Starring:  Lance Henriksen, Rona de Ricci, Jonathan Fuller, Stephen Lee, Mark Margolis, Carolyn Purdy-Gordon, Jeffrey Combs, and Frances Bay 
 Directed by:  Stuart Gordon 
 Written by:  Dennis Paoli 
 Based On:   The Pit and the Pendulum  by Edgar Allan Poe 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No. While  The Pit and the Pendulum  has been made into several films, this one isn't a remake of any particular film. 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  An innocent young woman is arrested for witchcraft and tortured, while the leader of the inquisition, the evil Torquemada, lusts after her. 
 Why I Love It:  I love Poe's stories and poems, so it's no surprise that I'd love the films based on his works. The film screams 90's camp, but that's hardly a bad thing. Lance Henriksen is wonderfully evil, he really makes the film the little gem that it is. 
 
 Title:   The Relic 
 Released in:  1997 
 Starring:  Penelope Ann Miller, Tom Sizemore, Linda Hunt, James Whitmore, Clayton Rohner, Chi Muoi Lo, Thomas Ryan, and Lewis van Bergen 
 Directed by:  Peter Hyams 
 Written by:  Amy Jones, John Baffo, Rick Jaffa, and Amanda Silver 
 Based On:   Relic  by Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  A detective teams up with an anthropologist when strange murders are committed in a museum, bodies discovered with the hypothalamus of the brain missing. They discover a strange, monstrous creature living beneath the museum, and it seems to need to eat these missing brain pieces. 
 Why I Love It:  Now, I saw this film before reading the book, which is a very, very good thing. If I'd have read the book first, I'd have been very upset, since the main protagonist of the  book series  (Special Agent Pendergast) isn't even in the film! But since I saw the film first, I was able to just take it as it was, and I loved it. It was the best monster movie of its time, and still holds up well today. A real fun ride. 
 
 Title:   Thirteen Ghosts 
 Released in:  2001 
 Starring:  Tony Shalhoub, Embeth Davitz, Matthew Lillard, Shannon Elizabeth, Alec Roberts, JR Bourne, Rah Digga, and F Murray Abraham 
 Directed by:  Steve Beck 
 Written by:  Benjamin Carr & Richard D'Ovidio 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  Yes 
 Of what?:  Remake of 1960's  13 Ghosts  , directed by William Castle and starring Donald Woods 
 5 Second Synopsis:  When his uncle dies, a man takes his two children and their nanny to visit the house that they inherited. While looking through the gorgeous glass house, they unwittingly release 12 very powerful, very homicidal ghosts. 
 Why I Love It:  I'm not sure why I love this one so much, but I really do. I know it's far from being a perfect film, but I don't know, I just have so much fun watching it, and the ghosts are just so cool and well done that it doesn't matter that half the film doesn't really make sense, hehe. 
 
 Title:   Underworld 
 Released in:  2003 
 Starring:  Kate Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, Michael Sheen, Shane Brolly, Bill Nighy, Sophia Myles, Erwin Leder, Robby Gee, and Wentworth Miller 
 Directed by:  Len Wiseman 
 Written by:  Danny McBride 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  A beautiful vampire warrior allies herself with a newly bitten werewolf when she begins to suspect that the war that has been raging for centuries between their two races is built on lies. 
 Why I Love It:  A whole lot of style with a little substance, but it hardly matters. This film is so fun to watch, so visually pleasing that you can't help but love it. And the story, while it's the same old same old rehashed stuff, is just different enough to keep you entertained. And talk about eye candy, my goodnessâ€¦ 
 
 Title:   Warlock 
 Released in:  1989 
 Starring:  Julian Sands, Richard E Grant, Lori Singer, Mary Woronov, and Kevin O'Brien 
 Directed by:  Steve Miner 
 Written by:  David Twohy 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  An evil warlock opens a portal from his time, the 17th century, to the present day to escape execution. A righteous witch-hunter jumps into the portal after him just before it closes, and vows to stop the warlock's evil for good. 
 Why I Love It:  Julian Sands. Do I really need another reason? Oh, I do? Well, I guess it's a good thing that the film is so much fun, then! Wonderfully campy and acted better than most movies in its genre, it's definitely a gem of the 80's. 
 NUMBERS 4 
 
 Title:   Event Horizon 
 Released in:  1997 
 Starring:  Laurence Fishburne, Sam Neill, Joely Richardson, Kathleen Quinlan, Jason Isaacs, Jack Noseworthy, Richard T Jones, and Sean Pertwee 
 Directed by:  Paul WS Anderson 
 Written by:  Philip Eisner 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  A rescue crew is sent to investigate a ship that has been missing in deep space for years. Once on board, they realize that the abandoned vessel isn't as empty as they first thought. 
 Why I Love It:  Everything about the film is awesome. Great acting, great effects, great story, and just enough gore to slightly turn your stomach but not enough to just make it a gore-fest (which, you all may know by now, I'm not fond of). Almost 20 years later, it still gives me shivers while watching. A sign of a job well done! 
 
 Title:   Frailty 
 Released in:  2001 
 Starring:  Bill Paxton, Matthew McConaughey, Matt O'Leary, Jeremy Sumpter, and Powers Boothe 
 Directed by:  Bill Paxton 
 Written by:  Brent Hanley 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  A man confesses to an FBI agent his family's story of how his religious fanatic father's visions lead to a series of murders to destroy supposed "demons." (Taken from IMDB, I was having a hell of a time trying to make a small synopsis, hehe.) 
 Why I Love It:  It's absolutely brilliant. Well written, incredibly acted, a wonderfully creepy story with a killer twist, before twists were a dime a dozen. Just wonderful. 
 
 Title:   Ginger Snaps 
 Released in:  2000 
 Starring:  Katharine Isabelle, Emily Perkins, Kris Lemche, Jesse Moss, Danielle Hampton, John Bourgeois, and Mimi Rogers 
 Directed by:  John Fawcett 
 Written by:  Karen Walton 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  After being attacked by a large, furry creature on the night of a full moon, teenager Ginger and her sister Brigitte are on the lookout for clues that she is turning into a werewolf. 
 Why I Love It:  It's fun, it's bloody, it's smartly written, well acted and has cool practical effects. Werewolf films are hard to do without getting schlocky, but  Ginger Snaps  manages just fine. Also, Katharine Isabelle is a fox. And she loves making horror films, good news for us pervy horror fans! ðŸ˜‰ 
 
 Title:   Idle Hands 
 Released in:  1999 
 Starring:  Devon Sawa, Seth Green, Jessica Alba, Elden Henson, Vivica A Fox, Jack Noseworthy, Katie Wright, and Christopher Hart's hand 
 Directed by:  Rodman Flender 
 Written by:  Terri Hughes & Ron Milbauer 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  A stoner's hand becomes possessed by an evil spirit and it kills his two best friends. To try stop the killing, he chops his hand off but, much to his chagrin, it just keeps moving and escapes his house to go wreak havoc at a school Halloween dance. 
 Why I Love It:  Despite its silly subject matter, this film is actually quite good. Laugh out loud funny with awesome special effects (that still hold up today), it's a great popcorn movie. Plus, Devon Sawa. Total 90's babe. Meow. 
 
 Title:   Near Dark 
 Released in:  1987 
 Starring:  Adrian Pasdar, Jenny Wright, Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton, Jenette Goldstein, Joshua John Miller, and Tom Thomerson 
 Directed by:  Kathryn Bigelow 
 Written by:  Kathryn Bigelow & Eric Red 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  After being bit by a beautiful vampire, a young man is given an ultimatum by her "family": make a kill within a week, or die. When he realizes he can't kill, he and the girl run off, with her family in hot pursuit. 
 Why I Love It:  I saw this for the first time as a teenager, and it had everything a teenage girl could possibly want. Romance, eye candy, and lots and lots of blood. Oh yeah ðŸ˜€ 
 
 Title:   Repo! The Genetic Opera 
 Released in:  2008 
 Starring:  Alexa Vega, Anthony Stewart Head, Paul Sorvino, Terrance Zdunich, Sarah Brightman, Paris Hilton, Bill Moseley, and Nivek Ogre 
 Directed by:  Darren Lynn Bousman 
 Written by:  Terrance Zdunich & Darren Smith 
 Based On:  Their play of the same name. 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  Set in a future where surgery has become a fashion statement, a chronically ill teen longs for the outside world. When she finally gets her wish, she's quick to notice that not everything in her life is as it seems. 
 Why I Love It:  A goth musical? With Sarah Brightman, Ogre, and Giles? How the heck could I  not  love it?? Great songs, great performances (even Paris!  gasp! ), and killer costumes, this was an instant cult classic. So much fun. 
 
 Title:   Signs 
 Released in:  2002 
 Starring:  Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin, Cherry Jones, and Patricia Kalember 
 Directed by:  M Night Shyamalan 
 Written by:  M Night Shyamalan 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  A preacher and his family find giant crop circles in their corn. Then they, and the rest of the world, come to realize that this time, it's no hoax. 
 Why I Love It:  A lot of people say that this was the beginning of the end for Shyamalan's films, but I really liked this one. Yes, there's a lot of self indulgent bullshit, but there's a lot of great, tense moments, too, which more than make up for it. 
 
 Title:   Sinister 
 Released in:  2012 
 Starring:  Ethan Hawke, Juliet Rylance, Fred Dalton Thompson, James Ransone, Michael Hall D'Addario, Clare Foley, and Nick King 
 Directed by:  Scott Derrickson 
 Written by:  Scott Derrickson & C Robert Cargill 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  A true crime writer moves his family into a house where a horrific quadruple murder took place. He finds old reels of home video in the attic that leads him to believe that these murders were just one in a string of horrifying serial murders, taking place as far back as the 60's. 
 Why I Love It:  This is an excellent piece of film. Well acted, well written, awesomely atmospheric. Us horror fans are blessed that an actor of Ethan Hawke's caliber loves doing horror films. But before you write this off as "just another ghost story", think again. It'd probably have been higher on the list, but I've only seen it once, and so many others are higher simply for being loved longer, hehe. 
 
 Title:   The Exorcism of Emily Rose 
 Released in:  2005 
 Starring:  Laura Linney, Tom Wilkinson, Jennifer Carpenter, Campbell Scott, Colm Feore, Joshua Close, Kenneth Welsh, Duncan Fraser, and Mary Beth Hurt 
 Directed by:  Scott Derrickson 
 Written by:  Paul Harris Boardman & Scott Derrickson 
 Based On:  A true story 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  A tough lawyer takes on the case of a priest who is accused of negligent homicide after the death of a young woman on whom he had performed an exorcism. 
 Why I Love It:  Exorcism movies, I find, are either amazing, or they're crappy. There doesn't seem to be a middle ground. This one is amazing. You wouldn't think a courtroom drama and exorcism horror would mesh well together in the same film, but they really do. I don't believe for a moment that this is actually a true story (not the possession part anyways, the  exorcism and trial  were real enough, though), but it's captivating, and all the acting is wonderful, especially from  Dexter  actress Jennifer Carpenter. 
 
 Title:   The Exorcist III 
 Released in:  1990 
 Starring:  George C Scott, Ed Flanders, Brad Dourif, Jason Miller, Nicol Williamson, Scott Wilson, Nancy Fish, and George DiCenzo 
 Directed by:  William Peter Blatty 
 Written by:  William Peter Blatty 
 Based On:   Legion  by William Peter Blatty 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  Yes 
 Of what?:  Sequel to 1973's  The Exorcist  , directed by William Friedkin and starring Linda Blair. 
 5 Second Synopsis:  As a police lieutenant mourns on the anniversary of his friend's death (Father Karras, from the first film), a serial killer strikes whose MO is eerily similar to a killer's who's been dead for 15 years. 
 Why I Love It:  This is the sequel that  The Exorcist  should of had, instead of  the abomination  that was made (seriously, what the hell was that??) It's a great story, and has real scares, with none of the camp that 90's horror was so famous for. A real, under-rated gem. 
 NUMBERS 3 
 
 Title:   Constantine 
 Released in:  2005 
 Starring:  Keanu Reeves, Rachael Weisz, Shia LeBoeuf, Tilda Swinton, Djimon Hounsou, Gavin Rossdale, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Max Baker, and Peter Stormare 
 Directed by:  Francis Lawrence 
 Written by:  Kevin Brodbin & Frank A Cappello 
 Based On:   Hellblazer  by Jamie Delano & Garth Ennis 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  A supernatural detective stumbles on a world-ending plot while ridding the world of demons. 
 Why I Love It:  I won't try give credit where none is due, Keanu Reeves is still a pretty bad actor. And yet this movie is awesome. The film doesn't follow the books very closely (but that's ok with me since I didn't enjoy them all that much anyways). But the story is great, the effects are amazing, and the supporting cast is very strong, giving poor Keanu all the help he needs. 
 
 Title:   Dracula 2000 
 Released in:  2000 
 Starring:  Gerard Butler, Justine Waddell, Jonny Lee Miller, Christopher Plummer, Colleen Fitzpatrick, Jennifer Esposito, Omar Epps, Jeri Ryan, and Nathan Fillion 
 Directed by:  Patrick Lussier 
 Written by:  Joel Soisson 
 Based On:  Characters created by Bram Stoker 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No. The  Dracula  story has been told in countless films, but this film, while based on the same story as all the others, is its own film, not based on its predecessors. 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  In modern-day London, the long-entrapped Count Dracula is unwittingly released by thieves, and goes to New Orleans to find the one born of his blood, Mary Van Helsing. 
 Why I Love It:  It's fun, hip, relatively well acted, and has a neat new idea for the identity of everyone's favourite Count. Gerard Butler turns in a mesmerizing performance, it remains one of my very favourite on-screen vampire portrayals of all time. And he's so sexy in this. So very, very sexyâ€¦. mmmmmmmâ€¦  snaps out of it  Ok, I'm done, sorry :-p 
 
 Title:   From Dusk Till Dawn 
 Released in:  1996 
 Starring:  George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Ernest Liu, Salma Hayek, Cheech Marin, Danny Trejo, Tom Savini, and Ted Williamson 
 Directed by:  Robert Rodriguez 
 Written by:  Quentin Tarantino 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  Two brothers on the run from the law take a father with his two kids hostage to sneak across the border into Mexico in their RV. Once there, they hole up in a brothel for the night to await a contact. Little do they know that this brothel is also a vampire nest, and they're going to have to fight through the night if they want to survive. 
 Why I Love It:  What not to love about this film? Badass characters, hyper-violence, buckets of blood, and lots of boobage, this movie is a ton and a half of fun, while still boasting a solid cast of good actors, and killer practical effects. Grab the popcorn and have a blast! 
 
 Title:   Identity 
 Released in:  2003 
 Starring:  John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, John Hawkes, Alfred Molina, Clea DuVall, John C McGinley, William Lee Scott, Jake Busey, and Pruitt Taylor Vince 
 Directed by:  James Mangold 
 Written by:  Michael Cooney 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  A group of strangers gets trapped in a small motel while a storm floods the roads. Elsewhere, a doctor awaits the arrival of his patient, who is on death row and is to be executed the next day. 
 Why I Love It:  Despite some rather shaky acting from some of the smaller cast members, this film is amazing. Good acting from the core actors, awesome story that'll keep you guessing till the very end, and a killer twist that actually makes sense. I'd have preferred the last 2 minutes to be cut from the film, though, I find it kinda cheapens the whole thing, which is why I gave it 9 stars instead of 10. 
 
 Title:   Queen of the Damned 
 Released in:  2002 
 Starring:  Stuart Townsend, Aaliyah, Marguerite Moreau, Vincent Perez, Paul McGann, Lena Olin, and Matthew Newton 
 Directed by:  Michael Rymer 
 Written by:  Scott Abbott & Michael Patroni 
 Based On:   The Vampire Lestat  and  Queen of the Damned  by Anne Rice 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  Yes 
 Of what?:  Sequel to 1994's  Interview with the Vampire  , directed by Neil Jordan and starring Brad Pitt. 
 5 Second Synopsis:  A long-sleeping vampire wakes when a bold and arrogant younger vampire decides to start a rock band, and divulges "vampire secrets" in his lyrics. 
 Why I Love It:  The acting is pretty shaky, the story is so far from Anne Rice's original idea that it probably shouldn't be allowed to claim to be based on her books, it's full of clichÃ©s, and yet I love it. And nothing anyone can say will change my mind. Trust me, people have tried :-p 
 
 Title:   Stir of Echoes 
 Released in:  1999 
 Starring:  Kevin Bacon, Kathryn Erbe, Illeana Douglas, Zachary David Cope, Kevin Dunn, Conor O'Farrell, and Jennifer Morrison 
 Directed by:  David Koepp

 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  After being hypnotized, a family man starts to unravel after he starts seeing cryptic messages from a ghostly girl. 
 Why I Love It:  Wonderfully acted, creepy and atmospheric, and well written, this is an almost perfect ghost story. 
 
 Title:   The Exorcist 
 Released in:  1973 
 Starring:  Linda Blair, Ellen Burstyn, Jason Miller, Max Von Sydow, Lee J Cobb, William O'Malley, and Mercedes McCambridge 
 Directed by:  William Friedkin

 Based On:   The Exorcist  by William Peter Blatty, a true story 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  After playing with a Ouija board, a young girl is possessed by a malevolent demon. Her mother begs a priest to perform an exorcism to save her. 
 Why I Love It:  Just the right amount of body horror with psychological terror, this is one of the original greats. Saw it for the first time when I was 16, and it still scares me today. A true classic. 
 
 Title:   The Last Man on Earth 
 Released in:  1964 
 Starring:  Vincent Price, Franca Bettoia, and Giacomo Rossi-Stuart 
 Directed by:  Ubaldo Ragona 
 Written by:  William F Leicester & Richard Matheson 
 Based On:   I Am Legend  by Richard Matheson 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  After an epidemic sweeps the globe and turns everyone into blood-sucking monsters, a lone survivor searches for a cure, while killing as many of the monsters as he can. 
 Why I Love It:  Vincent Price, Richard Matheson, and vampires? Of course I love it! No other reason is necessary! ðŸ˜€ 
 
 Title:   The Mummy 
 Released in:  1999 
 Starring:  Brendan Fraser, Rachael Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Kevin J O'Connor, Oded Fehr, Jonathan Hyde, and Patricia Velasquez 
 Directed by:  Stephen Sommers 
 Written by:  Stephen Sommers 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  Yes 
 Of what?:  Reimagining of 1932's  The Mummy  , directed by Karl Freund and starring Boris Karloff 
 5 Second Synopsis:  Adventurers looking for treasure and artifacts on an ancient Egyptian site accidentally awaken an evil mummy that had been buried for thousands of years. 
 Why I Love It:  I love anything to do with ancient Egypt, supernatural or otherwise, so it was a given that I'd love this one. Thankfully, it also happens to be great fun to watch. 
 
 Title:   The Stand 
 Released in:  1994 
 Starring:  Gary Sinise, Molly Ringwald, Jamey Sheridan, Adam Storke, Laura San Giacomo, Ruby Dee, Rob Lowe, Corin Nemec, Matt Frewer, Miguel Ferrer, and Ray Walston 
 Directed by:  Mick Garris

 Based On:   The Stand  by Stephen King 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  After a man-made super flu kills 99% of the people on earth, the survivors band together into two groups, one drawn by dreams of a kind old lady, the others by an evil man. 
 Why I Love It:  I saw this at 13 when it first aired on tv, and I hadn't read the book yet, which was probably a good thing, since it allowed me to love the mini-series, and not continuously compare it to the book. When I read the book a few years later, I was amazed at how much extra stuff was in it, but my love of the show was already cemented, hehe. It's hopelessly dated, but it's still a fun watch. 
 NUMBERS 2 
 
 Title:   Aliens 
 Released in:  1986 
 Starring:  Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, Carrie Henn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton, Jenette Goldstein, and William Hope 
 Directed by:  James Cameron 
 Written by:  James Cameron 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  Yes 
 Of what?:  Sequel to 1979's  Alien  , directed by Ridley Scott and starring Sigourney Weaver. 
 5 Second Synopsis:  The sole survivor from the first film assists a tough group of space marines in containing the Xenomorph threat, while a malevolent company wants the alien offspring captured alive. Naturally, stuff goes very wrong. 
 Why I Love It:  Do I really have to explain myself? A definite success in the merging of sci-fi and horror genres, it was, and remains, one of the best films of its genre. Everything was done so well that it's easy to forget that the film wasn't made recently, but rather almost 30 years ago. A sign of a job well done! 
 
 Title:   Beetlejuice 
 Released in:  1988 
 Starring:  Michael Keeton, Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, Winona Ryder, Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones, and Glenn Shadix 
 Directed by:  Tim Burton 
 Written by:  Michael McDowell & Warren Skaaren 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  After a young couple tragically dies in an accident, they're told that they will have to "haunt" their house for quite a few number of years. When a new family moves in and start making changes to their beloved home, they contact a "bio-exorcist" to make them leave. 
 Why I Love It:  This film almost didn't make the list at all, since I wasn't sure if I should include it in a horror list, but it's so awesome that I decided to go ahead and add it. Wickedly funny with awesome practical effects, this has been one of my favourites since I was a kid. 
 
 Title:   The Cabin in the Woods 
 Released in:  2012 
 Starring:  Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, Fran Kranz, Jesse Williams, Anna Hutchison, Bradley Whitford, Richard Jenkins, Amy Acker, Jodelle Ferland, and Sigourney Weaver 
 Directed by:  Drew Goddard 
 Written by:  Joss Whedon & Drew Goddard 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  Five friends go to a remote cabin in the woods for some R&R. Meanwhile, a government office seems to be preparing for something that involves the group. And that's pretty much all I can say without giving spoilers, just in case there are still a few horror fans who haven't seen this. 
 Why I Love It:  "Written by Joss Whedon" was all I needed to see to convince me to go see it. It was so much fun, so tongue-in-cheek, that's impossible to not love it. There are so many winks to so many horror films and tropes that even after multiple viewings, there's always something I didn't notice 'last time'. Just awesome. 
 
 Title:   Dracula 
 Released in:  1992 
 Starring:  Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder, Anthony Hopkins, Keanu Reeves, Sadie Frost, Cary Elwes, Richard E Grant, Tom Waits, and Monica Bellucci 
 Directed by:  Francis Ford Coppola 
 Written by:  James V Hart 
 Based On:   Dracula  by Bram Stoker 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No. The  Dracula  story has been told in countless films, but this film, while based on the same story as all the others, is its own film, not based on its predecessors, and is actually closer to the book than the rest. 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  After seeing a photograph of a woman who resembles his long-dead wife, a centuries old vampire travels to England to find her. 
 Why I Love It:  I don't really think I need to explain why I love this film, hehe. The only thing that's not perfect is Keanu Reeves' acting :-p 
 
 Title:   House on Haunted Hill 
 Released in:  1999 
 Starring:  Geoffrey Rush, Famke Janssen, Ali Larter, Taye Diggs, Peter Gallagher, Chris Kattan, Bridgette Wilson, Max Perlich, and Jeffrey Combs 
 Directed by:  William Malone 
 Written by:  Dick Beebe 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  Yes 
 Of what?:  Remake of 1959's  House on Haunted Hill  , directed by William Castle and starring Vincent Price. 
 5 Second Synopsis:  An eccentric millionaire offers a million dollars to one of four guests if they can survive the night in a supposedly haunted mansion, which used to be an asylum with a horrifying past. 
 Why I Love It:  Such a fun film that doesn't rely on jump scares to creep you out. I absolutely love this one. Strong acting, strong writing, and a superbly creepy setting make this film step ahead of a lot of others in its genre. 
 
 Title:   It 
 Released in:  1990 
 Starring:  Tim Curry, Richard Thomas, Jonathan Brandis, Annette O'Toole, Emily Perkins, Harry Anderson, Seth Green, Dennis Christopher, and John Ritter 
 Directed by:  Tommy Lee Wallace 
 Written by:  Tommy Lee Wallace & Stephen King 
 Based On:   It  by Stephen King 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  In 1960, seven outcast kids known as 'The Losers Club' fight an evil child-eating demon who poses as a clown. 30 years later, they are called back to fight the same clown again. (from IMDB) 
 Why I Love It:  I watched this when it came out,which meant I was 9 years old.  Pennywise  traumatized the crap out of me, and I've hated clowns ever since. But despite all this, I loved it, and still do. I'm not sure I'd have liked it so much had I seen it for the first time now, because it absolutely  screams  early 90's, so I guess it's a good thing I saw it way back then, hehe. 
 
 Title:   Pitch Black 
 Released in:  2000 
 Starring:  Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser, Claudia Black, Rhiana Griffith, Keith David, Lewis Fitz-Gerald, and Simon Burke 
 Directed by:  David Twohy 
 Written by:  Jim Wheat, Ken Wheat, and David Twohy 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  A cargo ship carrying a dangerous fugitive crashes on a planet that is always bright. When the sun finally goes down, though, the survivors realize that they are not alone. 
 Why I Love It:  I can't really explain why I love this one so much. It should have just been a generic crash-land-on-dangerous-planet thing, and yet just because all components were slightly better than usual, it made this film a total gem. At least to me, hehe. 
 
 Title:   Stigmata 
 Released in:  1999 
 Starring:  Patricia Arquette, Gabriel Byrne, Jonathan Pryce, Nia Long, Thomas Kopache, Rade Serbedzija, Enrico Colantoni, and Dick Latessa 
 Directed by:  Rupert Wainwright 
 Written by:  Tom Lazarus & Rick Ramage 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  A young woman is plagued with vicious bouts of stigmata, the wounds of Jesus Christ while being crucified, after receiving a rosary from her mother from Brazil. A priest from the Vatican is sent to investigate. 
 Why I Love It:  I'm usually not big on religious stories, but this one spends more time on the characters, and less time being preachy, and so I enjoyed it very much. The story is great, most of the acting is great, and Gabriel Byrne is a stone-cold fox. Three great reasons to love it, hehehe. 
 
 Title:   Gin Gwai (The Eye) 
 Released in:  2002 
 Starring:  Lee Sin-Je, Lawrence Chou, Candy Lo, Yut Lai So, Edmund Chen, Chutcha Rujinanon, Sue Yuen Wang, Pierre Png, and Yin Ping Ko 
 Directed by:  The Pang Brothers 
 Written by:  Oxide Pang, Danny Pang, and Yuet-Jan Hui 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  A young woman, blind from birth, gets cornea transplants, allowing her to finally see. But she soon realizes that her new eyes see much more than everyone else. 
 Why I Love It:  Asian films are often too weird for me to enjoy, but when they get it right, they get it  damn  right. The acting, effects, and atmosphere are all stupendous. A definite gem, express from Hong Kong. 
 
 Title:   The Woman in Black 
 Released in:  2012 
 Starring:  Daniel Radcliffe, CiarÃ¡n Hinds, Janet McTeer, Liz White, Shaun Dooley, Mary Stockley, Roger Allam, Jessica Raine, Sophie Stuckey, and Misha Handley 
 Directed by:  James Watkins 
 Written by:  Jane Goldman 
 Based On:   The Woman in Black  by Susan Hill 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  Yes 
 Of what?:  Remake of 1989's  The Woman in Black  , directed by Herbert Wise and starring Adrian Rawlins. 
 5 Second Synopsis:  A young, widowed lawyer is sent to close the estate of an old woman who just passed away. While getting her affairs in order in her manor, he is plagued by an evil presence that brings a horrible end to some of the towns' children. 
 Why I Love It:  Superbly acted and creepily atmospheric, this film was a masterpiece. Young Daniel upped his game for this role, and he did a wonderful job. It's hard to be in a film with so little dialogue and still be entertaining, but he, and the rest of the cast, managed beautifully. In my opinion, it's one of the finest films to come out of the horror genre in the last 15 years. The only reason it's not in the number ones is because all the films up there (save one) are long-time favourites. 
 And now, for the best of the best, my very favourites, the top 10 horror films that I strongly suggest everyone see, even those people who don't really care for horror. As usual, these aren't in any order, it's a 10-way tie for the number 1 slot, hehe. There's only one recent film, one from 2002, two from 1999, and then the rest are 1994 and earlier. But, like I said in my intro, you won't be seeing hardly any of the 'usuals' in this spot. My number one spot(s) is reserved for films that are actually good ðŸ˜‰ So, without any further ado, here are my- 
 NUMBERS 1 
 
 Title:   Fright Night 
 Released in:  1985 
 Starring:  Chris Sarandon, William Ragsdale, Amanda Bearse, Roddy McDowall, Stephen Geoffreys, Jonathan Stark, Dorothy Fielding, and Art Evans 
 Directed by:  Tom Holland 
 Written by:  Tom Holland 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  A teen becomes suspicious of his new neighbour when bodies of young women are found dumped in trash bags. He soon realizes the suave, handsome man is an evil vampire, and he tries to enlist the help of a tv vampire slayer to stop him. 
 Why I Love It:  One of the original great horror-comedies, this film is fun, campy, and scary. The actors are perfect in their roles, especially Chris Sarandon as the evil yet seductive Jerry Dandridge. The remake, while nowhere near as good as this one, is still worth a gander. 
 
 Title:   Interview with the Vampire 
 Released in:  1994 
 Starring:  Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Kirsten Dunst, Antonio Banderas, Christian Slater, Stephen Rea, Domiziana Giordano, Indra OvÃ©, and Thandie Newton 
 Directed by:  Neil Jordan 
 Written by:  Anne Rice 
 Based On:   Interview with a Vampire  by Anne Rice 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  A young man who has lost his wife and baby in childbirth is offered immortality by a charming but ruthless vampire. We follow him through his centuries of life as he tells his story to a young writer. 
 Why I Love It:  So beautiful and sumptuous. Incredibly acted and written, it follows the book quite closely (which is to be expected when it's the author who writes the screenplay). A lot of the actors don't look like their book counterparts, but the movie is so well done that I was able to forgive this. 
 
 Title:   A Nightmare on Elm Street 
 Released in:  1984 
 Starring:  Heather Langenkamp, Robert Englund, Johnny Depp, Amanda Wyss, Nick Corri, Charles Fleischer, John Saxon, and Ronee Blakley 
 Directed by:  Wes Craven 
 Written by:  Wes Craven 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  In the dreams of his victims, a spectral child murderer stalks the children of the members of the lynch mob that killed him. (From IMDB) 
 Why I Love It:  This was the very first horror movie I ever saw, even before  The Lost Boys  , which means I was just a wee thing (only 3 or 4 years old) when I saw it. And it's stuck with me ever since, still one of my top 10 favourites, even with the sometimes laughable acting and effects. When a movie is this good, lots of stuff can be over-looked! hehe 
 
 Title:   Poltergeist 
 Released in:  1982 
 Starring:  Craig T Nelson, JoBeth Williams, Beatrice Straight, Heather O'Rourke, Dominique Dunne, Oliver Robins, Martin Casella, and Zelda Rubinstein 
 Directed by:  Tobe Hooper 
 Written by:  Steven Spielberg, Michael Grais, and Mark Victor 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  A young family are visited by ghosts in their home. At first the ghosts appear friendly, moving objects around the house to the amusement of everyone, then they turn nasty and start to terrorize the family before they kidnap the youngest daughter. (from IMDB) 
 Why I Love It:  An absolute classic of the genre, it's still one of the very best haunted house films ever made, even 32 years later. 
 
 Title:   Sleepy Hollow 
 Released in:  1999 
 Starring:  Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Jeffrey Jones, Casper van Dien, Richard Griffiths, Michael Gough, Marc Pickering, Lisa Marie, Ian McDiarmid and Christopher Walken 
 Directed by:  Tim Burton 
 Written by:  Andrew Kevin Walker 
 Based On:   The Legend of Sleepy Hollow  by Washington Irving 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  A slightly eccentric Constable is sent to the small town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate killings that the locals are sure were committed by a ghostly headless horseman. 
 Why I Love It:  This is Burton and Depp at their very best, when the creative mojo was still mojoing, and they were still making terrific pictures together. The scenery is dark and brooding, the characters are all captivating, and Johnny Depp is, of course, absolutely gorgeous. Simply wonderful. 
 
 Title:   The Conjuring 
 Released in:  2013 
 Starring:  Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga, Lili Taylor, Ron Livingston, Shanley Caswell, Hayley McFarland, Joey King, Mackenzie Foy, Kyla Deaver, Shannon Kook, John Brotherton and Joseph Bishara 
 Directed by:  James Wan 
 Written by:  Chad Hayes & Carey Hayes 
 Based On:   The Demonologist: The Extraordinary Career of Ed and Lorraine Warren  by Gerald Brittle, a true story. 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  When the strange occurrences in their new home become more frequent and violent, a family of seven asks a husband and wife team of paranormal investigators to help them. 
 Why I Love It:  The most recent film in my whole list, and yet it blew right to one of the top spots almost immediately. Everything in this film is perfect. All the actors are in excellent form, the writing and directing are phenomenal, and it's more than just a little scary. Not many recent films have this kind of power and atmosphere. If you haven't seen this yet, I highly reccomend that you drop everything and go watch it right now!! ðŸ˜‰ 
 
 Title:   The Lost Boys 
 Released in:  1987 
 Starring:  Jason Patric, Corey Haim, Keifer Sutherland, Jami Gertz, Corey Feldman, Dianne Wiest, Barnard Hughes, Edward Herrmann, Jamison Newlander, Alex Winter, Billy Wirth, Brooke McCarter, Chance Michael Corbitt, Folsom the Dog, and Cody the Dog 
 Directed by:  Joel Schumacher 
 Written by:  Jan Fischer, James Jeremias, and Jeffrey Boam 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  When brothers Sam and Michael move to a new town after their parents divorce, they quickly realize that the town is over-run by vampires. Sam gets help from self-appointed vampire slayers, but for Michael it may be too lateâ€¦ 
 Why I Love It:  It was the first vampire movie I ever saw, and was the beginning of a life-long love affair with all things that go bump in the night. The story isn't really anything new (I'm not even sure there's any original ideas left anywhere), but the ride is so fun that it doesn't matter. Their vampires are the 'real' deal; they're strong, fast, sexy and oh so evil, just the way vamps aught to be, hehe. 
 
 Title:   The Ring 
 Released in:  2002 
 Starring:  Naomi Watts, Martin Henderson, David Dorfman, Brian Cox, Jane Alexander, Lindsay Frost, Amber Tamblyn, Shannon Cochran, and Daveigh Chase 
 Directed by:  Gore Verbinski 
 Written by:  Ehren Kruger 
 Based On:   Ringu (Ring)  by KÃ´ji Suzuki 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  Yes 
 Of what?:  Remake of 1998's  Ringu  , directed by Hideo Nakata and starring Nanako Matsushima. 
 5 Second Synopsis:  After her niece dies under mysterious circumstances, a journalist promises her sister she will investigate the death. What she finds is a cassette tape that kills you in seven days if you watch it. With the clock ticking, she must figure out what the spirit in the tape wants, or else die like everyone else who has seen it. 
 Why I Love It:  It doesn't happen very often that a remake is better than the original, but this happens to be one such instance. Despite the dated nature of some of the plot points (does anyone even own vhs anymore? lol), this film is still immensely watchable and creepy, even 12 years later. Everything is wonderful, acting, effects, writing, everything. Not just one of my favourite horror movies, it's one of my favourite  movies  , period. 
 
 Title:   The Silence of the Lambs 
 Released in:  1991 
 Starring:  Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, Ted Levine, Anthony Heald, Frankie Faison, Brooke Smith, Lawrence T Wrentz, and Diane Baker 
 Directed by:  Jonathan Demme 
 Written by:  Ted Tally 
 Based On:   The Silence of the Lambs  by Thomas Harris 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  A young FBI rookie is sent to ask the help of brilliant cannibalistic killer Dr Hannibal Lecter in catching another killer who kidnaps his victims, holds them for many days, then skins them to make a "woman suit". 
 Why I Love It:  I love serial killers. I've got this weird, morbid fascination with them. I watch a lot of true crime stuff, read true crime books, and of course, I love serial killer fiction as well. And this film, even after so much time, is still the best of the best. Hannibal Lecter and Buffalo Bill are still two of the creepiest serial killers ever to be captured on film, and it's still, to my knowledge, the only horror film not only to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture, but to win it. And it was very much earned. 
 
 Title:   The Sixth Sense 
 Released in:  1999 
 Starring:  Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, Toni Collette, Olivia Williams, Trevor Morgan, Mischa Barton, and Donnie Wahlberg 
 Directed by:  M Night Shyamalan 
 Written by:  M Night Shyamalan 
 Based On:  N/A 
 Remake/reimagining/sequel?:  No 
 Of what?:  N/A 
 5 Second Synopsis:  A boy who communicates with spirits that don't know they're dead seeks the help of a disheartened child psychologist. (from IMDB) 
 Why I Love It:  I do love me a good old haunting. I remember when I saw this for the first time. I went to see it at the cinema with my cousin. And we were both so blown away by that ending, we went back to see it again right after, just to see if we could spot any mistakes that would have the twist make no sense. We couldn't. And thankfully, unlike a lot of films with such twists, this film is so good that even knowing what's going to happen doesn't take any enjoyment away from the film. 
 PHEW!! That's it! I'm finally done!! I hope you guys really enjoy this article, it took me more than 3 weeks to complete! (Not working at it full time, obviously, but still!) I had loads of fun making it, and I hope you have as much fun reading it. 
 Thanks for coming by, and stay tuned for more! (I'll try my best to return to a more regular posting schedule ðŸ™‚ ).

 Movies, shows, books, music, games, fashion, makeup, food, I love it all! I'm a 38 year old mother of a rambunctious 9 year old boy. I'm often bed-bound because of illness, so I have a lot of time to spend on entertainment. I enjoy reading all kinds of blogs with top 10 lists and the like, but am often frustrated when the top spots are reserved for the same old stuff that, most of the time, I don't really like. So I decided to start a blog of my own, and throw my two cents out into the gaping sea that is the internet. I'm really enjoying writing these posts, so I hope they reach at least a few people who will enjoy them too :-) M.
