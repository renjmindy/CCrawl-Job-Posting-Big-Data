 I Get Around 
 June 15, 2019   cagethunderdome Leave a comment 
 So, not only was I finally able to get into the ring-I also tossed Cole back in by his trunks. 
 Turnabout is fair play, after all. 
 Heels can also get over-confident, particularly when the match has, frankly, been pretty fucking easy for them so far. Cole gave me an opening and I took it. 
 And once I was in the ring, I was determined to not only get my own back, but to give him the ultimate humiliation of losing to someone he didn't see as a credible threat. 
 His gorgeous, perfectly defined abs made for an oh-so-inviting target, too. 
 He didn't seem to like me standing on them and flexing. 
 As I listened to his groans as I put him through the wringer, I began to believe, you know? Believe that I could beat him, believe that I could be a BGEast star, believe that I, a rookie in my first match for the company, could take down one of their biggest and nastiest heels-something no one else had done so far. 
 I also was learning that I liked being in control, punishing my opponent, and even humiliating him a bit. 
 I also learned about over-confidence.

 Touch My Body

 It took me a while-and a lot of pain-to finally make it into the ring with Cole Cassidy. 
 He kept ambushing me-and beating on me-and not letting me get into the ring. I could get up to the ring apron, but once there-yeah. 
 Did I mention he kept  taunting  me, too? Yeah, there I was, crumpled on the mat outside the ring, my back and abs aching, trying to catch my breath…and then over it all I can hear him  sneering  at me. 
 Sneering. 
 Yeah, I took a lot of shit from him. 
 But you see-there's another lesson I learned early in pro wrestling:  never go to the well too many times.  Cole kept coming back out of the ring and after me…enjoying himself, obviously-and finally his overconfidence (and to be fair, who wouldn't be overconfident at this point? It's not like I'd even landed a fucking blow) was his undoing. 
 I got a great punch into his abs and doubled him over. 
 And it was time for some goddamned payback.

 No, not intimidating in the least. 
 The set up for the match was basically this: Cage, new wrestler in the BGEast Arena stable, wants to wrestle, and has challenged, Cole Cassidy, one of the nastiest heels ever to climb through the ropes for the BGEast cameras. 
 This is what the write-up on the website has to say: 
 Cage Thunder is one well-traveled wrestler. He 's faced some of the toughest men all over the world, but is always ready for more challenge. Of course, plenty of his hard-earned experience has come at the cost of some harsh punishment, but the masked star has never backed down from a challenge yet. Still, someone might want to offer Cage a little friendly advice before he bites of more than he can chew, if he hasn't already. When Cage let slip he'd be willing to take on dom heel and destroyer of men Cole Cassidy, more than a few ears perked up, and at least one devious mind set the wheels of fate in motion. 
 When word reached Cole he had a potential challenger (victim) in the making, he just had one question: "Where is he hiding?" Cut to Cage Thunder's daily gym workout at one of the rings he frequents: sans mask, pumping iron with thoughts of taking Cole Cassidy to the mats on his mind? When none other than Cole himself barges in, Cage is caught off guard to say the least. His hopes that the alpha male doesn't recognize him, and just there for a workout, quickly dim as Cole's attitude makes it clear he's not here for a pump. The beast is a specimen of physical perfection as he slowly strips his street clothes away, down to a simple pair of briefs, revealing his marvelously muscled physique, every curve and ridge of muscular definition standing out in stark contrast, as though to impress anyone in the gym able to catch a glimpse. 
 When Cage tries continue his routine, Cole humors him, sliding into a weight machine himself and working up a sweat as he pumps up his already impressive pecs, watching an increasingly nervous Cage from across the gym. When Cassidy has finally had enough of the game and gets in Cage 's face, the soon-to-be victim tries to rise to the challenge, only to have Cole bury his fist wrist-deep in Cage's abs. Thunder finds himself slammed to the wall, gasping for breath before Cole's fingers clench 'round his throat and force him upright. A few more fists and knees to the gut with Cage pinned to the wall and Cole finally lets him slump down, choking and panting. "I thought you wanted to wrestle Cole Cassidy?" He mocks his already downed and exposed challenger. 
 And yes, for an aspiring pro wrestler, there's nothing quite so humiliating as getting your ass kicked completely before you even get in the ring. 
 Choked, stomped, slammed, punched and beaten  before  I even got in the ring! 
 And it was beginning to look like I was never going to even  get  in Cole's ring….
