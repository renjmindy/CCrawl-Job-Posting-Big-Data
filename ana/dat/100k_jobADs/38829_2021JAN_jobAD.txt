  CAREEREALISM Media  
 Work It Daily | Where Careers Go To Grow 
 December 05, 2014 
 Here at CAREEREALISM, we don’t want people being able to spot the hottest trends, we want leaders who can CREATE the hottest trends! Good companies have a set of 4-5 traits they expect their employees to have to be part of their team. Great companies will have the same, but each employee will excel in one or more of those areas. Trend setting, Independent thinking, and creativity are just a few of the 11 top traits for employees at CAREEREALISM to excel in. Each day, our team works passionately to help individuals everywhere find career happiness and achieve professional success. CAREEREALISM Media was created in 2009 on the belief that every job is temporary. It's made up of two sites - The first, CAREEREALISM.com, is an online career advice magazine. The second, CareerHMO.com, is a virtual career coaching service. Together, they make up a company that strives to help professionals everywhere reach their goals.  “One of the upsides to joining a growing company like us is the  opportunity you have to do meaningful, impactful work  from day one.” _- J.T. O'Donnell, founder & CEO, CAREEREALISM Media _
