 Yearly and Monthly Astrology Forecasts 
 PISCES HOROSCOPE 2019 
 Now on amazon in kindle and paperback 
 Yearly overview and monthly forecasts for Pisces on love, life, sex and career. 
 “There is something electric in the air and Pisceans feel a sense of impending change and opportunity – life is about to go from simmer to boil. 
Pisces is all ready to embrace 2019 and you are staring by getting the roadmap out – no, I do not mean to A-Z of whatever you are, you are going to be looking at the potential routes for your life and how to reinvigorate your goals. It is not about career goals as such, it is about having a purpose and knowing that there is meaning in your life. 
We all have to let some hopes and dreams die along the way as we cannot chase every star and often dreams fade as we mature and basically grow up and yet it is vital to have dreams and hopes as they are what give our life a little bit of salt and stop it becoming bland. Pisces is more aware of the role these dreams and chasing them have on your life and you are ready for some new ones. Some call this phase a life audit, and yet that can be confused with a midlife crisis which has all sorts of negative connotations of balding men with sports cars and trophy girlfriends, this is not what Pisces are going through, it is more to do with injecting life with greater fulfilment and also having goals which serve as avenues to meet new and different people and rediscover things about yourself.”

 ARIES 
 Love  - Set time aside for love – spoil yourself and your loved one with massages, foot rubs and a TV dinner; make the most of Sunday but indulging in what you both enjoy most and shutting out distractions. 
 Career  - A time to bring greater organisation to what you do – put the bigger plans on the back burner and get to grips with details and tie up lose ends ahead of the week. 
 Health  - Greater energy and motivation mean even ambitious goals for fitness and sporting pursuits can be achieved today. You are at your most competitive and also most agile. 
 TAURUS 
 Love  - Love can be quite a tense arena today – there are things unsaid and emotions bubbling below the surface which are hard to define but which are making you uneasy. 
 Career  - Taurus are feeling some pressure; it is as if you have to up your game and yet you do not quite have a strategy set out yet. You have to put a few things in place and trust that the bigger pieces will fall into place and they will. 
 Health  - Unhealthy food can make you very lethargic now and so address tiredness by avoiding fast food and pre pared food instead of drinking coffee. 
 GEMINI 
 Love  - A time for single Gemini to be more philosophical in love, if you explore different ways to allow love into your life you can discover what brings you lasting contentment rather than momentary delight. 
 Career  - Good things come to your from the karmic cycle and so progress in your career is more about your past actions towards others than anything else. 
 Health  - If you have any pending financial matters to settle, do it now rather than putting it off for Monday as that which plays on your mind drags you down more than you think. 
 CANCER 
 Love  - In marriage and also romance you may have to bide your time; nothing much is happening and you cannot force the issue. Play it cool and wait for signs that the tide will soon bring in a new wave on which to ride. 
 Career  - In terms of career you have done enough talking, you have set out your stall, you should stay quiet and not add any more information or argument to the arena until you see what your opponent or superior is going to throw back. The ball is in their court. 
 Health  - Artistic expression can be very relaxing and so the best way to unwind is to hall out the paints or the pencils or indulge in any form of creativity even singing in the shower to help you blow off steam. 
 LEO 
 Love  - Sun approaching a square with Neptune makes being straightforward impossible as emotions are too complex and you wish to avoid showing weakness, however do not hide the truth or obscure it with bluster. 
 Career  - There is a cold light of day realism dawning in terms of career prospects and this is excellent as your recent lofty plans can now be moulded into something more practical. 
 Health  - In health, back pain can be an issue and this may stem from new exercises you are doing or to a poor quality bed and so if it does not ease up after a few days look into getting another bed or foam topper or perhaps it is chair you use which needs some adjustments. 
 VIRGO 
 Love  - You may feel that your partner is rather self centred and even intolerant of your deeper needs and emotions, you may have to accept this indifference for a few days; being dramatic about it will not help. 
 Career  - Don’t hanker after chances lost, things have now moved on and instead of trying to salvage something, wipe the slate clean and focus on the next big opportunity or plan of action. 
 Health  - Faith is the vital element in health – without believe in your diet plan or exercise routine or even in your personal trainer you cannot progress. Cultivating positivity assists in all health matters even more so than usual, so drive yourself forward with inspiring thoughts and keep doubts and negativity at bay. 
 LIBRA 
 Love  - The time for talking is over – you need to see some action. If Librans are finding that you are still having to explain yourself or nag a partner, you may have to accept they are just not going to get it and you need to move on from the issue or even from the relationship. 
 Career  - Getting ahead in your career means you have to focus on the way you manage people and the manner in which you communicate strategy – you have to be more creative about disseminating your message and that means being clear and simple as well as positive. You must believe in what you say if you want others to act 100% on your instructions. 
 Health  - This is a very good time for health as you feel more relaxed and are more at ease and less conflicted. It is however a time when you indulge more in alcohol and sweet treats and so calorie counting may not be going well. 
 SCORPIO 
 Love  - In new love affairs, what was going swimmingly and seeming like a summer haze of romance may be about to enter a rather complicated patch and so watch out for this and stay on your guard for control issues surfacing. 
 Career  - All may not be what is seems with a new opportunity that is coming up this week and so stay wary of offers from those in authority as they may seek to disguise ‘hard work for no more pay’ as some sort of chance to shine. 
 Health  - Avoid fresh ginger or chilli peppers and even garlic; Scorpio do not react well to these flavours right now. Make sure stir fries you purchase do not have these as part of the mix. 
 SAGITTARIUS 
 Love  - In romance Sagittarians can be a little emotional and not always that rational – keep things light hearted and stay joking with your sarcastic wit, don’t get too deep or you may end up feeling all at sea and a little confused at the reaction you get. 
 Career  - Get well prepared if you are gearing up for any presentation or encounter with the media or a large group as this chance to take the limelight may be more important for you than you currently think. 
 Health  - It may be worth asking more questions before you enter a sexual relationship with someone. In any event, stay cynical and stay protected. 
 CAPRICORN 
 Love  - Strong feelings, courtesy of Mars conjunct the moon, cause you to react quickly and impulsively in you marriage; with reason often having little baring on your decisions. You are emotionally quite charged up making this a volatile day, but a pro active one. 
 Career  - Do not be complacent in your dealings with managers or your boss; their mood may be about to take a turn for the worse and so prepare to get on their good side if they still have one. 
 Health  - Capricorn should focus on heart health this coming week and so other than eating more oily fish and less fried food, remember that yoga, Pilates and resistance training are all excellent for your heart and have low barriers to entry in terms of being accessible to most age groups and fitness levels. 
 AQUARIUS 
 Love  - You keep changing your mind in terms of decisions that affect your love life and that can make you tricky to be with as you don’t seem to know what you want or when you want it. 
 Career  - Time to be charming and more diplomatic; you tend to be very stubborn and that can be counter productive even if you are convinced that you are right and everyone else is wrong. Hear people out in the short run and you may be surprised. 
 Health  - Aquarians are feeling very tense and this can make you snappy and irritable; avoid arguments and avoid sparing partners. Try and look for neutral activities that engage mentally and physically without the risk of confrontation. 
 PISCES 
 Love  - Stay busy as right now the devil will make work for idle hands; or to put it another way, if you linger to entertain negative thoughts about your love life these can snowball into unhelpful confrontations 
 Career  - You may have to make some brave decisions this coming week and so stay in a fight ready mode – be prepared for action rather than assuming you will get what you want in a passive manner. 
 Health  - Over eagerness or over confidence can lead you into situations that may do you no good in terms of physical or emotional health and so no jumping into the deep end.

 Daily Horoscope May 26, 2018 
 Posted by  lisalazuli 
 0 
 ARIES 
 Love  - Relationships with fixed signs and the earth signs suffer the most challenges for Aries or should I say that you can be very challenging for them to deal with as you are so unpredictable, highly strung, and lively. 
 Career  - If you want to grab the headlines in your sphere of influence, you must capitalise on your position or build on what you have rather than striking out in on unrelated tangent. 
 Health  - You will jump at anything that provides excitement as your spontaneous side needs expression and part of you just needs to see how far you can push it. 
 TAURUS 
 Love  - Taurus are very curious, and you are also quick form attractions to others; you can get yourself into a spin, though, as you want to start a relationship fast, and you may not be as proficient in the nuances as you think. 
 Career  - Making new connections in your networks and extending those networks is important, and you should be more active in looking for people, associations, or groups to team up with – you may be able to add your creativity in exchange for something of value to you. 
 Health  - There is a chance to reduce stress and smooth over relations with people you deal with daily, especially if you have been at loggerheads, i.e., neighbours, etc. 
 GEMINI 
 Love  - Gemini have a chance to improve your status professionally; in some cases, this may be by virtue of a new love relationship or perhaps the new circles your partner is moving in is exposing you to a new set with whom you can network or spread your ideas. 
 Career  - Gemini should not be disheartened when you look at your age and circumstance and feel that certain things you wanted have passed you by, as even more exciting things are getting ready to rock your world. 
 Health  - They say Gemini sit on the fence and yet this is a defence mechanism you have, an essential one as you need to avoid confrontation and the stress of being put on the spot. 
 CANCER 
 Love  - Not a good time to pool resources with a partner, open a joint bank account, negotiate a prenup, share an asset or getting deeper into financial involvement. 
 Career  - Inventors get a boost, but it may not be so much about having an idea from scratch; it may be more about developing an idea into a sellable format that can grab attention and take off. 
 Health  - This period coming is also good for resolving childhood issues based on the greater awareness you now have on your life. The trick however is not getting stuck on ‘understanding’, but moving on to taking life forewad in a different way. 
 LEO 
 Love  - You need a greater degree of independence in relationships, but you should not resent a partner who appears to be denying you independence as you are probably the one who gave them permission (tacitly) to do that in the first place. 
 Career  - If you are not aware of your own need for power, you may attract people who are power hungry and who may be out to manipulate you – this will stir up resentment, and you may even feel hurt by the way they behave, but this is a call to you by the universe to learn healthy and effective ways of taking control of your own life. 
 Health  - Eat balanced meals, and make sure you do everything in moderation – no need to starve or be strict, just be moderate this weekend. 
 VIRGO 
 Love  - This is the start of a period when relationships which are restrictive and backward-looking, which offer no scope for your development as a person tend to fall by the wayside. 
 Career  - Changing dynamics at work or in your wider social environment can put you in contact with people who are unusual or eccentric, and you can learn from them as they draw you into their world. 
 Health  - Headaches are a sign you have gone too far – listen to your body. 
 LIBRA 
 Love  - Family matters and events in connection with your home are favoured, and that makes this a good time to have family over to stay, prepare for big family events, or entertain in your home. 
 Career  - You may work frenetically, tearing things up and starting over again; perfection is the aim, and that does not necessarily mean perfection in the traditional way, rather a perfection of purpose 
 Health  - Eat more salads and fruit salads, and make sure any soups do not have cream added. Eat gluten-free food. 
 SCORPIO 
 Love  - Unfulfilled sexual or romantic passions can be channelled into superb artistic work or poetry and music. This is an exciting time in love relationships, it’s more roller coaster than chilled glasses and candlelight, however. 
 Career  - Defeats are not really defeats right now; they are just messages that you are not at the right time and place and with a little more tinkering and preparation you can achieve perfection and more fortuitous timing. 
 Health  - Any form of control by others is fiercely rejected – Scorpio would rather be alone right now than stifled and controlled. 
 SAGITTARIUS 
 Love  - Your natural rhythms are rather out of sync, and that can make you totally disinterested in sex and affections while at other times you are really randy. 
 Career  - Embrace the future; you may well not agree with everything that is happening, but that’s a matter for philosophy; businesswise, you can gain financially from changes as soon as you accept that they are coming and look for ways to profit from them. 
 Health  - A good time for hiking, climbing, sailing, and adventure sports which are challenging enough to keep you focused. 
 CAPRICORN 
 Love  - You may rub your partner up with some new quirks and habits – it may become obvious that there are elements of your partner’s personality which are not very tolerant, and you may have been a little more boxed in than you realised. 
 Career  - You are highly entertaining and may find that comedian or entertainer in you who had been itching to bounce out. Often talents are revealed in a roundabout or unexpected way. 
 Health  - It is important to let your children choose their own direction as there can be a slight desire to live your dreams out via them. 
 AQUARIUS 
 Love  - Realisations dawn and a stroke of luck or a blessing that comes in the disguise of some disruptive force can open up a crack through which you can escape a mindset that is limiting intimate potential. 
 Career  - Events are stimulating, and you are enticed to try new things and new ways, out with the old and in with the new. In some cases, you reject what is perfectly OK if you see it as boring; any different and out there draws you like a magnet and in general conventional thinking is tossed aside. 
 Health  - This is a very competitive time where you aim for targets and do not consider defeat. You give off an air of confidence and also aggression which can wrong foot others and give you the upper hand. 
 PISCES 
 Love  - You can overlook many things your partner does as you tend to understand that the intentions were not bad even if the final result was a bit under par. 
 Career  - Thoughts tend to speed up, and often you reach a sudden conclusion that makes sense, and you are not even sure how you got there. 
 Health  - Pisces may want to think about adding more whey to their diet for its L-tryptophan and L-glutamine content, which are pre cursers to serotonin the ‘happy’ hormone.

 ARIES 
 Love  - Aries may not be heavily engaged in the relationship sphere as the big wide world calls and you are drawn to press on with ambitious plans, looking for greener pastures and perhaps not paying attention to your nearest and dearest. 
 Career  - Be careful of expert opinions or the advice of accountants or lawyers, etc. – make sure they have full information as their advice or calculations may be compromised as they do not have the full facts. 
 Health  - Stay away from crowds as they can bring out a wild side of you and you can feel inured to do things that you may not do if you were not carried away with the collective mood. 
 TAURUS 
 Love  - New relationships where you are still the centre of your lover’s attention satisfy most; Taurus must not, however, lead people on just to get that attention you crave. 
 Career  - You are very purposeful and have a strong need to take control which can put you on a collision course with those who do not share your vision. You may take decisions fast to prevent others interfering or modifying your plans – you are not in the mood to be stopped. 
 Health  - Often, mental issues you tackle right now can have been inherited or ingrained in you from parental reactions. 
 GEMINI 
 Love  - Sometimes it is time to move on and Gemini may need to cut ties with an ex; you do not need to know what they are doing or to feel somehow responsible for them, let them go and this will help you to focus more fully on new relationships. 
 Career  - Dealing with larger groups could pose difficulties and slow you up; smaller, more focused groups tend to give better results and quicker ones. Smaller teams are more effective. 
 Health  - Connecting with who you are, being bold about your beliefs and expressing yourself and your views, even if it flies in the face of group think is vital to an inner sense of power and be able to distinguish your true needs.

 Health  - You will be picking up a positive and supportive energy that you can work within and which enhances your natural abilities to get the most out of other people. Gut feel and instinct serve you well. 
 LEO 
 Love  - If life has become a tornado of activity or a treadmill of work, now is the time to shout ‘stop’ and create room for the affection, romantic stimulation, and feelings of togetherness that make the treadmill bearable. 
 Career  - You have more time than you think, and the worst thing you can do is sacrifice speed for accuracy just because you are under imagined pressure or feel that if you do not finish in double quick time, you will miss an opportunity. 
 Health  - You may have to deal with crisis in confidence, doubt in your own ability, and even a battle of wills with your coach or mentor, but you need to stick with it and gather the mental discipline to muddle through. 
 VIRGO 
 Love  - While the relationships which start now may not last, they can be triggers for a revolution in your life and a deeper connection with yourself. Even stable relationships cut deeper and demand changes and evolvement from you, perhaps more so than your partner. 
 Career  - You will find ways to circumvent an obstacle even if you cannot totally get rid of it – the universe will send you a new route as the course you are on is destiny. 
 Health  - Find a way to cast off the chains of adult life in some small way and reconnect with an inner child that is playful, excited about life, and intrigued by the great mystery of existence. 
 LIBRA 
 Love  - You can click with Scorpio, Aquarius, and Leo, who will be intrigued and also flattered by your depth and also your need to understand them. You are insatiably curious in the relationship sphere, you need to know everything and potential lovers adore that attention. 
 Career  - This is a fabulous weekend for Librans who write romance stories or novels or who perform as you have an added passion and understanding of the deep and dark forces in human nature, and you can convey those with authenticity. 
 Health  - Where there is a will, there is a way, and starting today you have the willpower and resolve to deal with medical and psychological problems bravely. 
 SCORPIO 
 Love  - Scorpio should see anger as a sign of insecurity and that you need to sure up aspects of family and home life. Often your anger explodes in the most personal aspects of life even though that is not the source of the anger. 
 Career  - Appeals to your emotions cannot work now as you will make decisions based on logic and reason – this makes you a tough person to convince of anything as you want facts! 
 Health  - This is a good period for being more regular about eating and exercise; you can set up routines and targets and will have a high probability of sticking to your rules and exceeding those targets. 
 SAGITTARIUS 
 Love  - Sagittarians love debate and are turned on by a good argument; you have to work hard to keep it about the facts and not get emotional or that ruins the thrill of the exchanges. 
 Career  - This is a powerful time intellectually, you are able to be more forceful and effective in terms of communicating information that you feel others must hear even if they do not understand it yet. 
 Health  - Travelling can be undertaken spontaneously, a great time for a sudden weekend away. You enjoy flying by the seat of your pants and taking off at a moment’s notice is very refreshing and enlivening. 
 CAPRICORN 
 Love  - Love affairs which start now are characterised by laughs, banter, fun and also some rather arousing emotional drama. 
 Career  - A change in core assumption can give you a whole new outcome that may just be a better fit regarding the bigger picture. So question everything even the unquestionable. 
 Health  - Right now you need to think about the specific ways in which you are insecure and how it affects you. You then need to trace it back – often issues like abandonment, being the black sheep of the family, bullying by an authority figure or being undermined. 
 AQUARIUS 
 Love  - Aquarians love a chase and so tonight you may be bolder than usual in chatting new lovers up or inviting a friend on a date. You will initiate sex and you especially enjoy new locations and new positions. 
 Career  - You need to lead right now and so if you feel that any meeting, group situation or procedure at work is stagnating, you are the one to kick start a whole new phase, often quite bravely. 
 Health  - You have a huge amount of energy right now and if you cannot fully engage in a sport or a consuming mental task you may get headaches or feel very irritable.

 Love  - You are rather mischievous, and you delight in entertaining others with your wit, charm and also your ability to play piano, tell stories or jokes. Pisces are masters of the social scene with effusive charm and diplomacy. 
 Career  - This is a very persuasive time, and Pisces can win others over with ease – it is easy for you to get your own way and lure others over to your way of thinking. You are clever with words and display a high degree of emotional intelligence. 
 Health  - Eat what is in season in your region. While caffeine is OK in small doses, make sure you have a quality coffee rather than a caffeinated soda.

 ARIES 
 Love  - Aries seek admiration and you may be too dependent on others for positive feedback where you should be working on developing your own self esteem from within and focusing on your innate positives that come naturally, so naturally you take them fore granted.

 Health  - While you have a great deal of enthusiasm, you tend to spray your energy here and there and so you end up feeling tired, possibly exhilarated but not with much success under the belt. 
 TAURUS 
 Love  - You are emotionally very impressionable today and while that can help you to understand others better, you are best not putting your own feelings on the line as you are better dealing with other people’s need than honestly confronting your own. 
 Career  - There is a fine line to tread between being assertive and being aggressive, you tend to take offence fast and that makes you take a fight response before it is needed.

 SCORPIO

 ARIES 
 Love  - A day filled with promise for meeting partners with potential and yet that potential can take a year or so to unfold. In marriage responsibilities feel lighter now, and so this is a good time to strengthen the emotional and sexual side of relationships. 
 Career  - This is an ideal time for planning not only staff parties but parties for your suppliers, distributors or anyone who you see as an essential part of your network and day-to-day worklife. 
 Health  - This is a very good time for training and weight-loss exercise; this is also great for those who want to build up to a big challenge fitness-wise. 
 TAURUS 
 Love  - You want the one you love to have your back, just as you have theirs, and any sense that they are less committed than you can make you withdraw and be less emotional. 
 Career  - Working in teams can be frustrating to you, and you may resent having to drag along the less able members – you need to make everyone feel included and valued to create more productivity in general. 
 Health  - You may want to press yourself hard physically, but this may be to let off steam rather than for fitness sake per se, and you should be careful to be measured and not reckless. 
 GEMINI 
 Love  - You will do anything for your loved one, and if someone crosses your partner, you will take it personally and go out of your way to fight their corner. You will also stick up for your partner if they are criticised by your family. 
 Career  - Often, your pre-conceived ideas can cloud your judgment, and you may resent being questioned. Try to take a step back and ask yourself if you are making decisions on actual facts or perceptions as perceptions can be more powerful than reality to you. 
 Health  - Trust in all your dealings is very important, and if you do feel that you have been betrayed or that your interests are compromised, you can be quick to end the relationship or take further action. 
 CANCER 
 Love  - Cancer are friendly and sociable, which means if you are single you will be placing yourself in the ideal circumstances to meet interesting new partners who have good long-term potential. 
 Career  - Sharp and eloquent, you know what you want, and that will make it much easier for you to get it. Your focus is clear, and your mind is processing information fast. 
 Health  - This is a great time to start lessons to improve skills, i.e., your golf swing, tennis serve, French pronunciation, your vocal range (if you are a singer), etc. 
 LEO 
 Love  - This is a very practical and solid time in relationships where contentment, security and common purpose grow, increasing deeper understanding and long-term happiness. 
 Career  - Your judgment is very good right now, and that can help you in business, i.e., by choosing the right associates and identifying the best plans, and it can also help you if you work with people where you make judgement calls every day, i.e., the police, social work, legal advice or arbitration. 
 Health  - You will get bored very fast, and it will take a great deal to keep you occupied; you will seek new people, places, and often you can be rather extreme in seeking new experiences. It’s all about novelty and creating excitement. 
 VIRGO 
 Love  - Your partner may find you a little erratic and very hard to understand. You are extremely impulsive right now, and some of your decisions may not go down well. 
 Career  - Today old school ties, glass ceilings and perceived social class divides are more apparent and may hamper your progress. You have the will right now to fight against entrenched views and change things for yourself and others. 
 Health  - Don’t overdo it – this weekend it can be hard to know when enough is enough. So be it partying, promoting, working – know when enough is enough and don’t burn too much of the midnight all. Pace yourself from today. 
 LIBRA 
 Love  - A great time for the start of a new love interest. Aquarians are very appealing to the opposite sex right now as you are giving off a confident air. You are also more likely to make a move on someone who interests you, and this will open the door to new romance. 
 Career  - Creatively you are fired up and can produce work fast and furiously – some of your work may need quite a bit of refining and editing later as you are inclined to just go for it, letting vent to all your deeply held emotions. 
 Health  - You are not likely to make new friends or contacts now unless there is a very powerful reason to form that connection as you simply do not have the emotional energy to keep superfluous friendships going. 
 SCORPIO 
 Love  - Scorpio are great actors, and often they play a role; it can be part of a fantasy or indeed a way of self-protection, but how long is it sustainable, and what happens when reality tests a new relationship? 
 Career  - You may find that you are disappointed in an authority figure who was once supportive and even instrumental in helping you in your career – this reflects how far you have come and that you can now see their mistakes and know that you want to avoid those mistakes. 
 Health  - It can even be that you have a period of lessened contact with family members who you feel are controlling or are negative influences. 
 SAGITTARIUS 
 Love  - Your partner cannot be convinced by arguing; let the matter lie, and discuss it at a time when you are both relaxed. Use the art of subtle persuasion rather than hammering home your ideas aggressively. 
 Career  - This can a good day for any Archer involved in teaching or raising awareness, no matter what the subject, as you are skilled at putting ideas across in an inspiring way. 
 Health  - Sagittarians have to be wary of bad habits making a return as your disciple and resistance is low and so stay away from situations where you could face temptation and fall off the wagon. 
 CAPRICORN 
 Love  - You are very romantic right now and also extremely adaptable to the needs of your partner. You may get quite some satisfaction from helping or caring for your loved one. 
 Career  - You can rely on your gut feel, flashes of insight and sudden inspiration to give you a spurt on in both business and artistic pursuits. 
 Health  - Your ESP is strong right now, and you should not ignore hunches about people or places, even if they do not make sense – you are attuned to the atmosphere and able to pick up on subtle signals others are giving off. 
 AQUARIUS 
 Love  - Little will get you down right now, and even if your loved one is a little reserved or even down in the dumps, you will cheer him/her up. You will most likely want to surprise your partner with a special gift, meal or even a trip away as you are highly spontaneous. 
 Career  - Those with artistic interests will have excellent prospects in terms of receiving more training and honing your talent by developing new skills. This is an excellent time for all self-expression and for taking creative projects forward. 
 Health  - This is a time of beig mature and you need to face up to the sharp side of things – this means acknowledging that there are often tough decisions to make in impossible situations, and that you cannot always please everyone, but you still have to be decisive to get ahead. 
 PISCES 
 Love  - Pisces are looking for a mirror for their own emotional intensity and may find love with Scorpios, or Cancer especially right now. 
 Career  - An ideal time to begin new adventures, especially ones that are ambitious and long range – this is the time to start journeys (not in terms of travel, but terms of goals), and you should enjoy every step of the way rather than fixating on the eventual outcome. 
 Health  - Understanding your own psychology and especially your relationship psychology could be the key to breaking bad habits. It is also time to address areas of your life where you are becoming too inflexible and a little obsessive.

 April Horoscope 2018; Love, Career, Health. 
 Posted by  lisalazuli 
 0 
 ARIES 
 Love  - Aries need to manage their jealousy, possessiveness, and sexual desire carefully as it is hard to sweep things under the carpet – as if you do they tend to build up like a volcano; however, it is also not easy to be open with your partner as with Jupiter and Mercury both retrograde communicating and being open minded and tolerant is hard as emotions, especially the deep seated and explosive ones can get the better of you. 
 Career  - Mercury retrograde in your first house encourages Aries to press the pause button and also the reset button regarding the way you project yourself. You need to perhaps redo your CV or your Linked In profile, and if you regularly use the same speech or presentations, you need to bin that and start from scratch. 
 Health  - With Chiron entering your first house, Aries have the power to make the best of what may seem to be a limiting or a bad situation. Often it is the struggles you face which define you more than your successes and which shape you and compel you to discover a talent you may otherwise never develop. 
 TAURUS 
 Love  - Taurus have a great deal of charm and a positive energy, and yet Taurus can go overboard in relationships, especially new ones, setting your sights high and having great expectations which are almost impossible to meet. You can be a little rollercoaster: going from hot and quickly to cold when your route map for the relationships no longer matches reality. 
 Career  - With Mercury retrograde until the 15th of April, you may be in a wait and see mode – it could be that you are relying on other people getting their act together or approvals from government or large business coming through, but you cannot yet get going even though you are itching to. 
 Health  - While you need stronger boundaries from those close to you who seek to externalise their issues, your healing can be their healing too, and so you should not shut yourself off totally. 
 GEMINI 
 Love  - A very good month to meet a new partner. Love relationships at work are likely and can get deep very quickly, but perhaps you should hold off on the sex for a little while as the stars suggest that new sexual relationships can be off to a tricky, yet exciting start with some quite explosive episodes which may not bode well for your working relationship if you are together most days. 
 
 Career  - The challenge for Gemini this month is to ask yourself where you are regarding your life socially: do you accept anything and go with the flow to be trendy and surrounded by people? Where do you start and your friends end – are you an extension of the social group or its leader regarding thought? How influenced by friendship groups are you? Do they have the power to make you feel bad about your life or inadequate? 
 Health  - It is a time to embrace being different and to throw off any masks you wear to make yourself more ‘acceptable’ to the people and places you think matter. Only when you move will you begin to feel your shackles. Who really matters? 
 CANCER 
 Love  - You can be quite erratic this month, and if you are with a Taurus, Leo, or Scorpio, they may not like that at all; however, Gemini, Aquarius, and Sagittarius will want to encourage it and use the opportunity to get the relationship into a whole new mode where it’s all spontaneous, and anything goes. 
 Career  - This movement this month of Chiron into your tenth house cusp will last all year and is a call to jump on some new train tracks with your name on them. Yes, you need new meaningful goals that dovetail with your values and passions and give you a sense of pride and self-respect that is irrespective of worldly reputation and measurement. 
 Health  - Limit caffeine this month as you are hyper as it is. Avoid sweeteners and also chocolate, especially dark chocolate. Eat more whole grains, eggs, avocado, and nut milks. Make sure you get sunlight or supplement your vitamin D. 
 LEO 
 Love  - Love running smoothly means being aware, watching what you say, and being cognisant of what is going on. Leo must be willing to adjust and take on board the feedback you get both explicit and implied from your partner. Communication is not just about what is said, it is understanding what is behind the words and reacting to that quickly. 
 Career  - Mercury is retrograde until the 15th of the month, but it goes direct at the same time as the new moon giving you impetus to get cracking on things again. Until Mercury goes direct, it is an ideal time to refine and perfect – while dealing with the messy little details can be a real snooze fest, they are best dealt with now so that your projects can build up steam after the 15th and more importantly so you are not as vulnerable to criticism and attack. 
 Health  - Strong opinions or beliefs can be causing you more pain than the good they bring into your life. Leo may need to detach a little from things which could be becoming obsessions. Is some desire, belief, or quest taking over your life? 
 VIRGO 
 Love  - Virgo are very expressive right now; you are exuding charisma, and your devil may care approach is very attractive. Right now, you have a certain Scarlett O’ Hara about you; you are more flamboyant and also dramatic, and you do not take any nonsense from anyone. 
 Career  - You will not take no for an answer this month; Virgo are more wilful and decisive, especially when it comes to eliminating waste or anything deemed trivial or superficial, and that includes people. You are highly incisive and intuitive in the way you see to the heart of a matter, and while in your Virgo way you always prefer reason and logic, you cannot deny the strong appeal of gut feel right now, which cannot be explained away. 
 Health  - With Chiron entering your 8th house this month, you are entering a phase of sexually questioning and awakening. This is a time when those of you who have experienced ambiguity about your gender may be ready to take the next step in addressing this issue and becoming more comfortable with who you are. 
 LIBRA 
 Love  - The asteroid Chiron passes into your 7th house this month, and that propels you to work on relationships of all kinds and also to learn from them. It is not enough to keep plugging away in the same old manner; it is time to be more aware of what goes on at a subconscious level and to be more honest about key emotional drivers in relationships. 
 Career  - Passion for a cause or for your work can have a deeply healing effect. Often immersing yourself in some artwork, study, or perhaps an engaging business project can help you escape other element of your life and create a meaning which helps you transcend limitations. 
 Health  - This month is an excellent time to seek psychological help or to commence counselling. It is a time when you are more able to face what is painful as you want to transcend your current limitations and find a pathway to a better future. 
 SCORPIO 
 Love  - Scorpio prefer one to one companionship right now and will prefer cosy nights in with a partner rather than going out or hanging out with friends. If you are dating, you may keep that under your hat or only tell a few close friends rather than broadcasting your dating curriculum and introducing everyone to your new beau. 
 Career  - This is not a month where Scorpio enjoy networking or work-related social events – you like to get on with the work and are not that patient with schmoozing and corporate networking. 
 Health  - Scorpio are a little vulnerable this month, and so it is best to surround yourself with friends and embrace the predictable rather than throwing yourself to the lions regarding any situation in which you may face criticism or harsh treatment. You are more sensitive to rejection, and so it is not the best time for dating unless you are developing a friendship into a romance. 
 SAGITTARIUS 
 Love  - Romance in the workplace is a distinct possibility, and so you may want to linger by the coffee machine just a tad longer and have a chat. Do not get so buried in your iPad or phone that you forget to check out any new talent in your office. 
 Career  - You have heard the phrase get back on the horse – they always say the sooner you get back on the horse after a fall, the better. This month it is time for Sagittarians who decided in some part of life not to get back on the horse, to do it. It can be especially relevant to romantic life and creative life as these are both elements of life where you put yourself on the line and almost up for criticism and selection, and rejection in this area can be more painful as it is like something fundamental about us is rejected. 
 Health  - Although banana is fattening, Sagittarians have a sweet tooth this month, and quite an appetite and so eating banana can help fill the gap and give you that sweetness you crave in a healthy and energy boosting way. 
 CAPRICORN 
 Love  - It is a time when you do sweep things under the carpet, not because you are afraid of dealing with them or are avoiding stuff, you just realise that these issues are not a priority and are better left for another time. 
 Career  - Mercury is retrograde until the 15th of the month which means you may have to retrace your steps and begin to review information or work already done so that you can spot errors and update with new information or new perspectives which are dawning on you. 
 Health  - Chiron enters your 4th house, and this presents not a once in a lifetime, but an opportunity that does not come around every decade to resolve past issues and put away the effects or dispel the shadow they cast. We live in an era where suddenly due to changing attitudes and the openness in which sensitive issues are discussed it is now OK to speak about events of the past which were suppressed for many reasons due to fear, family, or social norms of the time. 
 AQUARIUS 
 Love  - Relationships somehow feel less comfortable this month; you are more aware of imbalances. Maybe you are giving more and feeling more, or perhaps you are the one being accused of not feeling or giving enough, and that may totally confuse you as it may not be your perception of events. 
 Career  - Mercury is retrograde until the 15th leading to some chopping waters and fluctuating circumstance in your daily life. Colleagues, systems, IT networks, the mail and deliveries cannot be relied upon so leave extra time for anything going by post and make sure you check any information that is handed to you by others as there are often mistakes. Double and treble check anything that goes to press and make sure you reference your sources. 
 Health  - With Chiron entering your 3rd house, Aquarians are presented with ideas that are healing and can potentially change your life by a change in your mindsets, but to benefit you have to let go of some of the fundamental building blocks of your worldview. 
 PISCES 
 Love  - You enjoy debate and conversation in love, and you are very good at relaxing your partner and getting them to open up to you; you will draw out all sorts of interesting information. You can get your partner to reveal much for very little information from you in return, you can speak freely without actually saying much. 
 Career  - Pisces can be very clever with money and other resources, you are good at juggling things about and getting quite a lot out of very little. You are good at edging out of things and can be inventive with the excuses. You can turn things about very quickly creating a positive out of a negative. 
 Health  - You may begin this month feeling tired and also less enthusiastic. The start of the month can be quite energy sapping as it is more frustrating and also filled with those boring or unpleasant chores that have to be done.

 Sagittarius Horoscope 2018 - Life, Love, Career, Health.

 Bigger and better in 2018. 
 “2018 is a year where Sagittarians can rely on a little magic. ‘One dream, one soul, one prize, one goal, one golden glance of what could be’ – the atmosphere around you is more electric and also more supportive, you feel increasingly plugged in to a grand scheme. Sagittarians are magnets for new situations and circumstances which offer more than you even imagined. Flashes of light show the way as your intuition fires up and guides you onto surprising routes where you are joined by people who before seemed opposed to you, but who you now see are on the same mission. Inner contentment and peace can be found more easily now via both the people you meet and circumstances you find yourself in. ‘The day will dawn of sanity’ as Jupiter acts as your guardian angel offering you spiritual protection and you are able to rid yourself of self-destructive tendencies, deeply ingrained fears and the burden of guilt. The bell that rings inside your mind is challenging the door which your own fears and anxieties have kept locked to you for so long. The magic is in unlocking, releasing and shining light into the dark places in your life.”

 ARIES 
 Love  - Love and romance can be a mine field where whatever you do you seem to run into a brick wall of misunderstanding and frustration and so no better time for a good romance novel and a quite night with a hot chocolate. Love your own company. 
 Career  - This is a blood sweat and tears time in career and so you have to knuckle down put in the hard work and show grit and determination, no Aries impatience now, draw on your inner steel and grit your teeth. 
 Health  - Aries have to be careful of your health right now as you may be run down and so boost your health with some fresh smoothies or take a singular iron supplement with vitamin C. 
 TAURUS 
 Love  - Events at home are very demanding and family matters or issues to do with home alterations or repairs can make you anxious and can also cause disagreements and discord in love. 
 Career  - You may struggle right now with choosing a priority, you feel as if your dreams are just there, just hovering and yet you cannot find the mental strength to just do that little bit extra that you know can be the difference between success and failure. Be patient, the mental energy will return.  
 Health  - Goals for self improvement may hit a set back and Taurus have to deal with some demoralisation – you need a good rest and then you will begin to feel the inspiration return. 
 GEMINI 
 Love  - Sex life is at a low ebb, there does not seem to be much time or even energy for intimacy and so not a bad time to withdraw and take you foot off the gas until the mojo comes back and it will just like a ball bounces back. 
 Career  - Things are slow when it comes to feedback from your communication efforts, you may find footfall weaker and it is a struggle to get the message out. It is a good time to rework wording on ads and find new keywords as the old message and keyword may not be hacking it. 
 Health  - Gemini tend to feel insecure on a very deep level and you may not even want to share your fears with those closest to you and so those nagging fears and anxieties can undermine your best efforts, so focus on these and put a positive spin on them. 
 CANCER 
 Love  - You have to be really cautious in love right now, this is not a good time to get engaged or have any engagement celebrations – be slow to commit in fact, be a commitment phoebe why not, it’s the best options right now. 
 Career  - Negotiations tend to go slowly, meetings are frustrating and often unproductive and so cut them short and devote time to something more productive. 
 Health  - It is a good time to do your own thing and work off your own initiative; working with others, even those you trust and love can be draining and you can have more satisfaction on solo projects and also if you get some exercise in an anonymous or remote location. 
 LEO 
 Love  - You have to work at relationships, the grass is not greener and if you are dating jumping from one relationship into another will be like jumping from the frying pan into the fire. 
 Career  - You may not be enjoying your work right now but you are committed to it and you feel an odd satisfaction in drudging through. A good time to deal with a large volume of necessary but not inspiring work. 
 Health  - Leo are very tenacious right now, you are able to put on a brave face, take on extra responsibility and absorb pressure – make sure you are conservative about what you eat, stick to plain food and avoid strong spices and sauces. 
 VIRGO 
 Love  - You cannot go faster than you are going, trying to get to that next stage in love won’t happen right now as you still have lessons to learn from your current position and so take note and ask why before you ask what next. 
 Career  - It is all about technique and so if Virgo are struggling in terms of your management decisions or coming up with creative inspiration, get back to basics, look to theory and look to formulae and use these building blocks to come up with 90% of the plan and then just add the cherry on top. 
 Health  - Time to get a cholesterol check or a blood pressure check. If you are younger make sure you switch to healthy fats now like coconut oil or extra virgin olive oil. 
 LIBRA 
 Love  - Right now Libra must look to the past in terms of your relationship, not to wallow or indulge, but to see it through more mature eyes and to review what happened with the tools you now have at your disposal to understand. 
 Career  - You will be looked upon by others to give advice as they sense somehow that you have the answers, and in fact, you do. 
 Health  - The foundation is critical to any building, and when it is not solid, that building is always shaky and vulnerable to attack, that means that your plans for self improvement in health, fitness or mentally must be rooted in a philosophy or a system of belief that can sustain you in the toughest times. 
 SCORPIO 
 Love  - Scorpio need to be free-spirited and independent and that means you have to give your partner more freedom too. New relationships which place undue pressure or demand are quickly discarded. 
 Career  - Shyness can be a problem today and you prefer to retreat and work in the background, this is not the most confident day for public speaking or dealing with people en masse 
 Health  - You cleanse yourself psychologically, you will experience many health benefits from more energy to faster recuperation or even total recovery from long-term complaints/ailments; however, it is not all one-way traffic, you can also support psychological healing by eating well.  
 SAGITTARIUS 
 Love  - You will not allow things to drift, and you will devise new ways to make your marriage or relationship more enjoyable, more conducive to romance, and more sexually exciting. 
 Career  - While Sagittrians can get by with less of the material, you will seek more regarding your interactions with other people, and you want those interactions to be more productive and so you look to cultivate loyalty in your business contacts. 
 Health  - Daydreaming becomes a vital part of life and escapism into your fantasy world where nothing has to make sense and where everything flows along at a happy pace is essential for relaxation and your general well-being. 
 CAPRICORN 
 Love  - Feelings of self-doubt and problems with self-esteem will be worked through – one person you cannot hide from now is yourself, and you are going to be there in the mirror, in the rear-view mirror, in your dreams and on your shoulder demanding love, understanding, nurture, and attention. 
 Career  - It is not just about being patient, it is about using that waiting time and those passing storms to prepare better, analyse your maps and to get that boat into perfect nick before you can set sail once again. 
 Health  - Polyphenols which can be found in strawberries, blackberries, plums, spinach, artichokes, cocoa, and cloves are excellent micronutrients which can help issues like stamina, osteoporosis, weight management, and cardiovascular health. 
 AQUARIUS 
 Love  - Marriage is all about changing and adapting to each other, you lose parts of your old life to build a new life together, it is a very forward thinking time when you are likely to feel optimistic and make far-reaching plans. 
 Career  - You may be spotted by someone with power who sees a spark in you which they want to nurture and work with. 
 Health  - Nothing can be taken for granted, but at the same time, the changes should not be seen as a threat; you are entering a time when some comfort zones need to be shattered, so they do not hold you back as you embark on new adventures. 
 PISCES 
 Love  - You demand freedom in relationships, but you almost enjoy it when a partner is a little possessive and sets down some boundaries – but you will never admit that. 
 Career  - You may find you no longer fit in with certain types of people; you are more discerning when it comes to associates and will gravitate away from people who do you or your reputation no good. 
 Health  - Positive new outlets for emotional expression, be they creative or based around charitable pursuits can serve as an escape. Events now can catapult you into a new arena of life, causing a sudden release of responsibility or obligation.

 ARIES 
 Love  - You may need to change your mind and so in love you may have to put the brakes on one course of action and admit that you are not that comfortable with it; it is not about be inconsistent it is about being honest. 
 Career  - Mercury going retrograde means that you have a three week period starting today when you need to refine your approach to situations; this is not a good time to launch a new venture or start a new job or business you should rather go over and over plans and strategies to make them perfect. 
 Health  - In your health and exercise routines perfection is important and so perfect your style and work at technique and you can get more out of your exercises. Be more careful about reading label and knowing what is in your food. 
 TAURUS 
 Love  - Go with your hunches about people and get ready to start new friendships that are platonic or romantic and are slightly wacky and which encourage you to go places that are somewhat uncomfortable but intriguing. 
 Career  - Patience is absolutely vital and you need to keep the faith with your chosen direction while the shoes drop and everything falls into place, not a time to quit or throw in the towel, hang in there. 
 Health  - Much of what happens that is important happens behind the scenes and so the psychological work you do on yourself and the way you work on tackling fears and any internal conflicts can have a great impact on your year going forward. 
 GEMINI 
 Love  - If you partner is not on board with your goals this is a time you need to accept that support is not forthcoming and learn to develop positive voices in your head to give you that boost regardless of a partner’s indifference. 
 Career  - Time to withdraw from your networks or the work you do with organisations connected to your work – you want to evaluate how useful your contacts are and whether you need to sort the wood from the chaff and get rid of time wasters. 
 Health  - You need to focus on your goals and not get waylaid by the social carousel; is your health important or is being popular more important, make a choice and ditch the in crowd for more time in the gym. 
 CANCER 
 Love  - If you have any online profiles on dating sites it is time to update them and add some more spin and polish – be more daring and sell yourself. This is an advert for you and so get excited about what you write and put more of you in there. 
 Career  - You cannot take anything for granted especially in terms of any high profile work or publically important announcements ad so make sure you are word perfect and totally confident in your arguments. Delay a presentation if you are not quite ready yet. 
 Health  - You need to have a complete plan if you want to be more healthy – that includes what you eat, when you eat, how you eat and fitness timetables. It should also include sleep and meditation. 
 LEO 
 Love  - You don’t want to be arguing over beliefs and overarching themes, right now in love the best thing to do is take it one day at a time and concentrate on the trivial little details which can bring you together where the big issues made divide. 
 Career  - You need to have a plan A, B and C right now – you also need to go over the little details as they smaller things can trip you up now rather than the biggest things which may have all your attention. 
 Health  - Your long terms plans can be thrown into quandary thanks to Mercury Retrograde in Aries and so you need to hold on to your dreams while allow yourself to adjust the compass to take account of new circumstances. 
 VIRGO 
 Love  - You need to work hard at understanding in love and this means tackling tough issues and bending your head around those parts of your lover or spouse’s character that confuse or even annoy you. 
 Career  - Mercury retrograde in your 8th means you need to tackle finances and debt and develop new schedules to keep debt down; not the best time to take on more debt or make a major investment decision where you pool money with others. 
 Health  - A time when you have to dig deep in order to succeed, you also have to make use of your instincts and also of a Machiavellian streak that can manipulate a situation in order to survive. 
 LIBRA 
 Love  - Assumptions are dangerous in love and so you have to strip away any perceptions that are not based on 100% facts as that is the best way to deal with confusion and distrust. 
 Career  - You need to be keenly observant and watch out for small signs and signals that people you work with are getting ticked off, side-lined, bullied or annoyed and you need to address their concerns. 
 Health  - Mercury retrograde in your 7th means that you need to be careful of whom you share with and so this may not be the best time (for 3 weeks from now) to have counselling or therapy. 
 SCORPIO 
 Love  - Scorpio need to look out for getting involved in relationships where you are effectively the parent, the back stop and the one with whom the buck stops. In existing relationships avoid slipping into this parent child situation. 
 Career  - From today with Mercury retrograde in your 6th house Scorpio will learn fast who you can rely on in terms of your colleague and employees and who are just free loading or secretly undermining you. 
 Health  - Today Scorpio need to go back and look at the facts of your life and come to better conclusions about how and with whom you deploy your energy, don’t get stressed out over things you could just throw on the scrap heap. 
 SAGITTARIUS 
 Love  - In romance you just have to muddle through right now and for the next 3 weeks as with Mercury retrograde nothing can be predicted and it is a good time to get to know each other better sexually and emotionally with no strings or expectations attached. 
 Career  - Creativity can follow a zig zag pattern right now and so you must improvise in any artistic pursuit and go with the flow rather than sticking to rules. 
 Health  - Having fun and being spontaneous are as worthwhile as any other health pursuit and so forget the gym or the diet and enjoy the day. 
 CAPRICORN 
 Love  - In love, you can sit back and wait – things come to you and you do not need to be looking as love can arise in the most mundane, obscure and unusual of places. 
 Career  - It is very important to go back right now to your mission statement (in your business) or to refocus on your core value and aims that you may have lost sight of in the day to day rush and so think about that and see how it changes your motivation. 
 Health  - Capricorn should not hesitate to question their fundamental values in order to get to the heart of what you believe and resolve inner conflicts that may arise. Small insights can net you large gains, particularly in the future stability of your ship. 
 AQUARIANS 
 Love  - Love and sex tends to go out the window as things are about to get hectic and in the mad rush communication is not that effective – you tend to do what you have to do and have little time for cozy nights or meaningful conversations. 
 Career  - A period of confusion follow Mercury going retrograde in your 3rd house and you will have to change tack and deal with what comes up as it comes up rather than things that were on your to do list. 
 Health  - You should delay any work related travel for the next few weeks starting from today as it can be disruptive, unproductive, stressful and very draining. Make better use of facetime and facebook lives to connect with others. 
 PISCES 
 Love  - Pisces are having a touch of difficulty in new relationships as although you are naturally optimistic on the outside, your new partner may be touching off some sensitive issues that you normally bury and that may make you withdraw. 
 Career  - With Mercury retrograde in the 2nd house of money you need to be money wise and keep things simple, not a good time for go for any plan that is highly complicated or which you do not fully understand, 
 Health  - You can feel pulled in two different directions and weighing pros and cons is rather stressful, you need to pull away from people who are forcing you to make a decision in one direction as you have to be fully happy with decisions now and it is better to go with your heart rather that with the pressure.
