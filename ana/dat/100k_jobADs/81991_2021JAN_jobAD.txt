 As 2020 draws to a close, there are 10.7 million unemployed U.S. workers. Surges in cases of COVID-19 and increases in hospitalizations have led to record numbers of new jobless claims. 
 New jobless claims for the week ending December 19 came in at 803,000, according to the  Department of Labor . That's less than the 888,000 expected by economists. Updated unemployment data will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on January 8.
