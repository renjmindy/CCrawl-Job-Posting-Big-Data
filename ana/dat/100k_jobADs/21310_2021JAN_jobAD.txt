 Not just tools - job orders, too 
 Our modern production facilities offer you the opportunity to manufacture your own articles in the quantities you need. You can work your metals in a variety of ways or you can mould plastics on our injection moulding machines in your chosen (company) colours using a single or multi-component process. In addition, we can offer you modern magnetic engineering and a variety of individualisation techniques for applying logos, slogans or labelling to your products. And the best thing for you is that you don’t have to invest in any expensive, high-maintenance machinery of your own. 
 What can we do for you?

 Good reasons for job order manufacturing at WURO 
 Low costs 
 For many busi­nesses, the acqui­sition of expen­sive machines for each indi­vidual machi­ning process is simply not worth­while. That’s why we offer you job order manu­fac­turing for metals and plas­tics to help keep your produc­tion costs down. A signi­ficant competitive advantage! 
 Certified quality 
 Your expec­tations are what drive us on. That’s why we always ensure that our opera­tional proce­dures are closely moni­tored and constantly opti­mised. For us, the certifi­cation of our work processes to DIN ES ISO 9001 simply goes without saying. 
 Long-standing expertise 
 Since 1961, we have been your reliable partner for tool manu­facturing from Freudenberg in Germany. From us, you get every­thing from a single source, from design to com­pletion, which gives you full control over the entire process from start to finish. 
 Personal contacts 
 Personal customer care is extremely important to us. So that you can constantly be brought up-to-date quickly, we provide you with your own personal contact who is extremely well acquainted with your project. This cuts out the unnecessary trouble of finding the right person. 
 Flexible all-round solutions 
 With our versatile range of machines, we can simul­tane­ously take on several process steps, making things much easier for you. Metal working, plastic injection moulding and indivi­duali­sation all under one roof. This reduces manu­factu­ring time and increa­ses our speed of response to short-notice alteration requests. 
 Punctual processing 
 To prevent bottle­necks in your opera­tional proce­dure, we process your articles quickly within a trans­parent, pre-defined time frame. This enables you to plan the sub­sequent work stages reliably.
