  6 Steps To Building Your Real Estate Career From The Ground Up  
 Adept Marketing 
 August 10, 2013 
 You've completed the required training. You've successfully passed the tests and paid all of your fees. It's finally time to begin your  real estate career . But where do you begin? 
 
 1. Review The Laws 
 First, check with your local real estate association for specific laws in your state. Although most states require realtors to work in an office under a broker for a set period of time, the laws vary from state to state. If your state requires this, you should find a real estate office that you feel has the same goals, personality, and style that fit you and your vision for your future career in real estate. 
 2. Get Business Cards 
 Business cards are one of the easiest self-promotional items you can have. Order or print about 250 business cards with a professional picture of yourself and your contact information. Hand these cards to everyone you meet, from your child's teacher to the cashier at the grocery store. Let people know that you're a real estate professional, you never know when you will find someone looking for a  new home . In addition, some people have found success with sending postcards to friends and acquaintances announcing their new position. **** 
 3. Buy Professional Clothes 
 If you don't already have them, purchase professional clothing. Always arrive for work appearing clean and professional, since you only get one chance to make a first impression. Keep your car clean as well, since many clients will want to ride with you rather than follow you in their vehicle when they go to see a home for sale. 
 4. Advertise 
 Advertise, advertise, advertise. After contacting those you know, many offices will ask you to make cold calls in order to establish a customer base. In addition to cold calling, mail flyers or hang them on door knobs, purchase newspaper space, radio time, and any other type of advertising you can afford. Remember that establishing your customer base can take time, so prepare yourself financially. 
 5. Hold Open Houses 
 Volunteer to hold open houses or assist colleagues with showings as much as possible. Some offices also offer certain times when real estate professionals can be the "realtor of the hour". During these periods, all incoming calls are forwarded to the realtor on duty. This is a great way to establish new customers, so be sure to take advantage of as much call time as you can. 
 6. Make Contacts 
 Not only focus on building your customer base, but your home builder contacts as well.  Home builders  are the ones that supply you with homes to sell to those customers. Having a solid relationship with any home builder will help your career in the right direction. Remember that the real estate market is highly dependent upon our economy. Be patient, determined, and out going in order to obtain success. Your new career can be a bit intimidating at first, but if you jump right in, you will be comfortable in no time.
