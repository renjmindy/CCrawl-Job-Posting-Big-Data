 Post I Like - The One Thing We Need To Improve In 2020 
 January 3, 2020January 3, 2020 Hammad Rais 2 Comments 
 
 For many, their workplace is a heaven but do they actually know that some of their colleagues may consider it as hell? 
 Because a place where most of us spend such a big amount of our weekly time should be a place where individuals are treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their personal believes. 
 Kally of  MiddleMe  is talking about what should be done to improve and nurture a healthy working environment, regardless of its size.

 MiddleMe 
 We are in the 21st century however, we are still very much lacking in basic human decency to treat an employee in the workplace. 
 In Japan, people are suffering from Karoshi –  overwork death  in Japanese. All over the world, females are being paid significantly lesser than their male counterparts. In reality, many of us are still suffering from workplace abuse and harassment. Something that nobody wants to talk about. A sensitive topic that managers and HR want to shush it under the carpet. 
 It’s shocking, isn’t it? 
 Bullies are not just in school or in the playground. They are very much real in our workplace. A place where we suppose to feel safe where we put in many hours, sometimes more hours than we spent at home. 
 
 It isn’t just about the one-time careless sexist remark from your coworker. 
 
 It’s about fearing  you will be fired  anytime because you…

 How Much To Give To Get Some? 
 April 25, 2017April 25, 2017 Hammad Rais Leave a comment 
 An out-of-nowhere spike in workload will always result in the utter disturbance of inner harmony, especially for someone who so much long to keep his mind sane.

 Out Of The Blue 
 March 7, 2017September 21, 2018 Hammad Rais 16 Comments 
 For me, yesterday was a hectic day and today was mere inches away from being a disastrous one!

 Okay, let me explain. Today, 2 senior most officials from my company's global HQ in Germany landed in Karachi to meet us and get an in-depth insight about our working. Since my company is a small but vital part of their giant organization, this visit was termed as the most important event of the year by our local management.  Continue reading ->

 The Story Of My Garden 
 February 2, 2017November 15, 2017 Hammad Rais 6 Comments 
 I work in a garden where many other gardeners also work. Some of them have more tools than others, hence they can perform more efficient gardening. This garden comprises of many sections and it is full of different kinds of plants. Many of them produce fruits all year long while many are not so fortunate.

 Project Portfolio 
 July 25, 2016 Hammad Rais 4 Comments 
 23rd Feb 2015 was the day I published my first post. It was also the day I created it up and the reason for doing so was an assignment. I was doing a short course on Content Writing back then and the instructor advised every individual in whole class to create their respective blogs on WordPress.  Continue reading ->

 Reblog: The Zakota Syndrome - Sitting Idle At Workplace 
 April 27, 2016April 27, 2016 Hammad Rais Leave a comment 
 
 Exactly a year ago, I published a post on my blog about those individuals who show up everyday in their offices for work but instead welcomed by boredom. All those 9 to 5 workers (including me) goes through this many times and we don't know what to do when this happens. So on one such day, I wrote up a post for those people and published it here. 
 Back then, I had no idea that this post of mine will become my #1 viewed post! 
 That's right. This post holds the record of my most viewed post and it is still going strong. 
 If you are sitting idle in your office these days, then this post is for you, my friend. 
 Enjoy!

 What is the relationship between a 2 decades old TV series catchphrase (about which the world has no idea) and sitting idle at workplace?

 The Day I Became A Lion Hunter 
 December 20, 2015October 18, 2017 Hammad Rais 8 Comments 
 Like all other fathers of super-charge kid (or kids), weekend is something very special. Kids anxiously look forward to spend time with their daddies who were unable to play with them on weekdays because of their jobs. 
 Uzair is no exception and weekend for him means staying with his Baba from dusk till dawn, and beyond.  Continue reading ->
