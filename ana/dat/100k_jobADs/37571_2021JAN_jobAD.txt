 WHY DO WE SHOW EXPIRED LISTINGS? 
 We are seeking a person or couple to be our maintenance person/team for summer of 2019. 
 This person will be responsible for physical upkeep of the park including minor bush/tree trimming, fixer-upper projects, maintenance of flowerbeds, and other similar duties as assigned. (No lawn mowing.) As compensation, a site will be provided at no cost and includes water, electric, sewer, cable TV, and WiFi hookups. 
 We are a 32-site campground in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. You can expect mild summers and will work in tandem with our camp hosts, though you will have separate duties. Our campers are mostly retired folks who enjoy our quiet park. We are pet friendly, too! You'd be expected to be on-grounds from mid-May to early to mid-October, though dates are negotiable.
