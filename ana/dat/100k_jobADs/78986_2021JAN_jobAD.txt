 Help for Job Seekers 
 WorkHere is a text based recruiting service. 
 If you are having problems, we want to help. 
 What is WorkHere? 
 Employers engage WorkHere to provide a very high level of customer service to job seekers like you. Our client employers want you to have a real person to help you through the first steps of the hiring process. All jobs WorkHere recruits for are direct hire (meaning you are on the actual employer’s payroll). In most cases, we do three things to help you with your job search: 
 
 Answer questions and help you understand the job and the employer. 
 Confirm you are qualified for the job (and we will even help you figure out what is the best job for you). 
 Connect you with the interviewer or hiring manager, if you are qualified and interested in the job. 
 
 Can I Call WorkHere? 
 WorkHere relies on chat and text messages to communicate. If you want us to respond quickly, typically in a few minutes or less, please text us. 
 I’ve Deleted or Lost My Chat With WorkHere 
 You can text us at (317) 827-7069 to reconnect. Our system will connect you with the WorkHere chat team member you were working with. 
 Is WorkHere a Chatbot? 
 We are a service that features live, human agents. We do have chatbots that may answer when a live human is not available. 
 Does WorkHere Get a Percentage of My Pay? 
 No. WorkHere does not get paid by a percentage of wages nor do we get a cut of your pay. We are paid on a fee-for-service basis by the employer for advertising jobs and providing our live chat service to job seekers like you.
