The Bottom of a Bottle 
 Trust me, I've been there, I've looked, I've searched and I know now, that there are no answers to be found in the bottom of a bottle or on the edge of a blade! Fighting Hard, Recovering, Rebuilding, REBORN. Moving on from addiction to a new life.

 In Awe – Job 36:27-32 
 In awe 
 We watch the lightening 
 Light up the night skies 
 Through our windows 
 We watch 
 As the rain falls 
 We shudder 
 At the crack of the lightening 
 And roar of the thunder 
 Yet so many 
 Just stand in wonder 
 In awe 
 While the faithful 
 They know 
 Our Gob be awesome in power 
 He commands the rains to fall 
 To bring life to His creation 
 And to those 
 Who stand there and watch 
 In awe 
 
 Job 36:27-32
