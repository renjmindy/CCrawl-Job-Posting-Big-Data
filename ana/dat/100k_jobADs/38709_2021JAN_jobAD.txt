 Primer Tricks

 Tinted Formulas: light pink primers can add a glow. Lilac shades brighten sallow skin, and green formulas neutralize redness. 
 
 
 Don't Pile Up: When you overload on primer, it piles under your foundation, instead a small drop will rub into the skin for even coverage. 
 
 
 Pat your Eyes: Pat around the eyes and on the lids, primer acts as a three-in-one. It prevents makeup from smudging by absorbing oils, it softens, and it counteracts redness. 
 
 
 **TIP: To set your makeup, follow this order: primer, liquid foundation or tinted moisturizer, translucent powder. Without a dusting a powder, the water in your makeup and the silicones in most primers repel each other.

 Baby Johnson Cleans your Makeup Brushes 
 
 Post author By  Ayah Mufleh

 No Comments on Baby Johnson Cleans your Makeup Brushes 
 
 Cleaning your makeup brushes on a regular basis is an absolute must for many reasons. After multiple uses, bristles begin to build up with residual makeup, which makes them less effective when it comes to application and they become a home for bacteria that will irritate your skin and cause breakouts. 
 Professional makeup artists usually clean their brushes after every use, but for us at-home users, every week is a good time, but again it depends on often you use them. 
 
 Step 1  You'll need Baby Johnson and a fresh towel to lay the brushes on to dry. . 
 Step 2  Add Baby Johnson on to a surface , run your brush’s tip under lukewarm water and gently swirl the brush tip of a surface (a bowl). Tip: Never turn brushes up vertically — make sure they’re always facing downward — otherwise, water will weaken the glue that holds the bristles together. 
 Step 3  Once all the residue is completely gone, set your brush flat on the towel to dry. 
 
 Instead of using a bowl or the surface of my sink I've been using the  Cleaning Mat  by Sigma Beauty. I love it because it has 7 different textures to remove everything off your makeup brush without damaging the brush.

 Apples? Cheekbones? 
 
 Post author By  Ayah Mufleh 
 Post date  July 3, 2018 
 1 Comment on Apples? Cheekbones? 
 
 Sometimes it's quite confusing to know where to apply the blush to achieve the look you want, here are two simple ways: 
 
 
 For APPLE like blush:- Smile in the mirror so your apples pop out. Hold the smile while you brush the blush along. Try not to get too close to your nose. 
 
 
 For CHEEKBONES blush:- Suck in your cheeks so your cheekbones pop out. Move the blush along the top side of it. Try not get too close to your eyes. 
 
 
 I use the  Charlotte Tilbury Blush , it's so pigmented and gives me the subtle pinkish color that works so naturally with my makeup.

 Eye-lighting - basic

 No Comments on Eye-lighting - basic 
 
 Processed with Snapseed. 
 Even though it's all about brightening the inner corner of the eyes and making you look 100% more awake. Highlighting is a very important technique used in makeup. If you highlight incorrectly or in the wrong place its a recipe for disaster. 
 Makeup by Alexandria  
 "Highlighting the inner corner of the eyes has been around for awhile," explains celebrity makeup artist Kira Nasrat. "When you add an extra layer of highlighter in the inner corner of the eyes it makes your eyes pop and look further apart." ( Marie Claire) 
 Image: Shutterstock 
 The placement of the highlight is very important when trying to create naturally beautiful eye makeup. Your lighter colors (whites, creams, and pearls) should be applied in the inner corners, the middle of the eye, and just under your brow bone. Apply your lightest colors first, and then move on to your darker shades. 
 Apart from the inner corners of the eyes you can use the highlighter under the eyes to hide any dark circles to create the soft focus effect. You should use a solid highlighter and apply it after foundation but before concealer. 
 P.S. For a night time look apply a more metallic shimmery shade than the regular beam highlighter used for the day.

 For Flawless Foundation 
 
 Post author By  Ayah Mufleh 
 Post date  April 22, 2018 
 No Comments on For Flawless Foundation 
 
 When foundation is done wrong, there’s no hiding the mistake. You need to learn/ know how to apply it because a bad foundation always shows. 
 Use a Brush: Spread foundation into the skin with light, circular motions. This technique also lets you use less product and build coverage, since it’s easier to add more foundation than to take off excess. 
 Apply foundation everywhere: You probably already know to blend foundation past your jawline and onto the neck, but if your neckline is showing, you’ll want to blend the color there too. Plus, don’t forget the ears! Fair-skinned complexions in particular are susceptible to redness on the ears. P.S. blend a light layer of foundation over your eyelids and lips. 
 Use highlighter  before  foundation: there's no strict or defined way of applying makeup, some people apply concealers before foundation others don't but I can tell you what actually works. for a subtle natural look, you can actually apply your highligher before the foundation so the glow looks more natural, as if it's actually coming from your face (natural light). Having the highligher applied before your foundation can help last a full day, I don't know about you but when I apply the highligher after foundation it tends to get a little dull throughout the day. Having it underneath, gives that glow. 
 Ishimmer Foundation Recommendation: 
 1- Giorgio Armani  Silk Foundation. 
 2- Giorgio Armani  Maestro Foundation . 
 3- Becca Aqua  Luminous Foundation . 
 4- Fenty Beauty  Pro Filt'r 
 5- Charlotte Tilbury  Magic Foundation

 Coconut Oil as a Makeup Remover? 
 
 Post author By  Ayah Mufleh 
 Post date  April 10, 2018 
 No Comments on Coconut Oil as a Makeup Remover? 
 
 Coconut oil, a favorite of the Victoria's Secret Models, that reminds you of the sand on your feet and salted breeze by the beach. 
 Other than its fresh and beach-y scent it has great benefits for the skin, acting as a makeup remover is one of them. I was surprised by how quickly it took off eye makeup and by how easily it worked and it actually removes waterproof mascara without rubbing the eye out. 
 Surprisingly so many celebrities are on for this routine, some use it as a natural mouth wash (removing stains from the teeth), some use it as a makeup remover and others use it as a form of the "no make up look" as a dewy look. 
 Suki Waterhouse - uses coconut oil to treat damaged dry skin. ( aceshowbiz.com ) Miranda Kerr - uses coconut oil for the face and hair. ( hawtcelebs.com) 
 Here's How:- Since coconut oil is solid at room temperature, scoop out a little and rub it between your fingers to warm it up first. Smooth that over your skin with your fingers, then wipe it off with a dry cotton ball and it'll take your makeup with it. Repeat until all of your makeup is gone and then maybe one or two more times. 
 Why?: Coconut oil breaks up water-resistant substances used in eye shadow and mascara, releasing them from the skin and lashes, it'll even leave your skin softer and younger-looking. It's great for your skin, because it moisturizes, soothes and hydrates. 
 ***Disclaimer : Please do not use if you have allergies or skin irritation.

 Contour Kit… 
 
 Post author By  Ayah Mufleh 
 Post date  June 9, 2015 
 No Comments on Contour Kit… 
 
 Anastasia Beverly Hill, Contour Kit. A palette with six shades, three for contouring and three for highlighting. Darker shades of the palette are for shading and defining while lighter shades are made to enhance features. The set contains all the colors to emphasize the jawlines, cheekbones, lips, browbones, eyes and nose. 
 Its variety of shades are suitable for most skin tones. For those with lighter skin, contour using Fawn. Those with medium skin should stick to Java. And lastly those with darker skin should be using Havana. I think all the highlight shades are fabulous and like there is a shimmer one as well. I especially love Banana as its yellow undertones mask virtually any redness and is perfect for setting your under eye concealer. 
 
 Contour + Highlight Tip: Draw lines down either side of your nose with a shade 2-3 tones darker than your skin tone. This gives the illusion of a longer, slimmer nose. You can also apply the darker shade under your cheekbones to exaggerate them. The key is to BLEND. You can also apply the contour on your jawline to define and slim your face. Dab a highlighter on the top of cheekbones, your cupid’s bow and down the center of the nose for a dewy finish. There you have it xxx

 No Comments on 4 steps to master the winged liner!! FINALLY 
 
 Kardashian makeup master Mario Dedivanovic understands the struggle. Kim Kardashian's very onw makeup artist gives out his 4 tips to master the winged liner. 
 
 "Determine first how far out you want to wing the liner." 
 "Using an nude or white pencil, draw a little dot at the outer corner of eyes to where you want the line to reach." 
 "Draw the line along your lashes and connect the line to the dot for a perfectly even wing." 
 "Lean your elbows on a flat surface or table in front of mirror so that you have a very steady hand. Wah lah!" 
 
 *** Mario Dedivanovic was asked which liner was his favourite, and he recommends M.A.C Liquid Liner.

 An #essentail of mine #bettyloumanizer by @thebalm_cosmetics I wear it a lot, it gives a dewy and #luminous look. Adds warmth and #glow to your face. A must have #summer accessory. Just imagine wearing it after a #tan can be used as a #blush too (bronzed look) 
P.S Never wear a #bronzer all over your face.
