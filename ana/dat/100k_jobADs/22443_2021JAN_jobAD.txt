 Mr. Macapagal, 
 To qualify for the said healthcare jobs in UK, applicants should be eligible to work in the United Kingdom. This means that you need to have a valid UK visa or or UK right to abode certificates for you to be able to work UK in either temporary or permanent caregiver UK jobs. But this is only applicable if you are applying directly to the country where you wish to work. If you go through channels like a recruitment agency, they are the one who takes care of the necessary papers. 
 For your further info, I have already featured an article about a POEA approved UK Jobs in Care, just visit the article with the same title on this website for the contact infos and address of the recruiting agency. To easily find the article, just go to the Category Section of this website which can be found on the left side of this website. Look for the category Caregiver Jobs in UK and click it, then look for the article titled UK Jobs in Care. Be sure to check with the recruiting agency if the POEA job order for the said caregiver jobs in UK is still active or not because it was approved for recruitment by the POEA last June 1,2009. 
 For more agencies offering nanny and caregiver jobs, I suggest that you also visit the website Nanny Jobs Online at jobsnanny.com and Caregiver, Nanny, and Housekeeping Jobs Worldwide at nannyjobsonline.blogspot.com 
 For nursing jobs abroad, I suggest that you visit the website Nursing Jobs Abroad for Filipinos at nursingjobs.ph 
 For POEA approved jobs, I suggest that you visit the website approvedpoeajobs.blogspot.com
