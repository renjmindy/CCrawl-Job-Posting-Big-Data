 Thiago Alcantara posted a  video  clip in which he bid farewell to his club Bayern Munich, in preparation for his joining Liverpool in the next few hours. 
 During the  video , Thiago said, "Yes, I have made the most difficult decision in my sports career." 
 And he continued, "I will close this chapter of the story with this wonderful club, in which I matured as a player for 7 years, during which I won titles and had fun and also we went through difficult times together." 
 "But what makes me feel most proud is that I arrived in Munich as a young player full of dreams, and now I will leave, and I have all achieved them with a club with a history and culture." 
 "Here I learned to love the culture of bidding farewell to the club today, but I will never forget it, Mia San Mia." 
 And he added, "I experienced wonderful moments in Bayern, everywhere in Munich. My family and I were treated very well, and loved every second of me here. My decision stems from a purely sporty nature. As a footballer I want new challenges to develop myself more." 
 "Bavaria will remain my country, thank you, Bayern."
