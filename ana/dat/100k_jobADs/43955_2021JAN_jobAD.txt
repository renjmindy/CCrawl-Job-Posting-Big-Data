 Cancer Messed with the Wrong Hellion 
 Simply the Best Job Yet! 
 January 8, 2017 Tink the Belle 
 A little over a year ago, I received a grim cancer diagnosis from Dr H. 
 This particular surgeon looked far too frail and unsteady to be in a kitchen slicing tomatoes, let alone performing an intricate surgery. 
 I just wanted out of there. 
 Then I had the privilege of meeting Dr K, an oncologist with the bedside manner of a boorish oaf. 
 Dr K. informed me that all the prayers in the world wouldn't be enough to save me. 
 He also made it clear that I could go to 100 different doctors, and they would all confirm this. 
 At that point, I was not fearing cancer as much as being "treated" by these two doctors. 
 So out the door I went, thinking of all the other possibilities that surely must exist. 
 After trying a little of this and some of that, I was doing fairly well. 
 I had taken total charge of my personal health, while doing my best to reduce the level of stress in my life, and even taking an extended time off from work. 
 I became my own full-time job. 
 It was the best job I ever had. 
 Reconnecting with myself. 
 Finally becoming Number One.

 Seems to me Dr K. could learn a thing or two about the power of prayer. üòâ

 In retrospect you should thank those two doctors. They provided you the impetus needed to take back control of your life. Their disconcerting manner made you more cognizant of your NEEDS allowing your conscious mind to re-direct your priorities and place YOURSELF FIRST! Sometimes situations that seem like a "black hole," in reality provide clearer insight for pursuing better directions in life. 
 Often traditional doctors focus on extending mortal existence. To many of them, this is how they define LIFE. They think in terms of QUANTITY rather than QUALITY. None of us know our length of stay on this planet, but ALL of us possess the skills (if we look within ourselves) to create a quality we truly desire. It sounds like these doctors helped you find this path of self direction. CONGRATULATIONS and enjoy the PROCESS and JOURNEY!

 Thank you! Indeed the process and journey was a defining moment in my life that led me to an oncologist who truly and passionately encouraged me to visualize the healing during my treatment . I'll be discussing that more in my next blog post, so stay tuned. üôÇ

 "Finally becoming number one." Congratulations for making that shift. We're plagued by messages to care for everyone else and in doing so, sacrifice ourselves. Blessings to you. You have a beautiful site that radiates with hope.

 love, love, love this - I was diagnosed on 2007, first had a horrendous general practitioner, then an awful oncologist. somewhere I read that the most 'difficult' patients statistically live the longest - so began my journey of truly seeking self-awareness & assertiveness! as well as knowing when to change doctors! 
 best of all the best to you, dear Tink üôÇ
