 Jobs at the Willi Elbe Group in Raufoss 
 JOBS AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES IN RAUFOSS 
 In 2001 the Willi Elbe Group acquired its location in Raufoss, Norway from the previous owner, and in 2010 it left its former location in an industrial park and built its new factory. In the 8,000 m² facility 71 employees operate an array of interlinked, highly automated metal forming systems equipped with state-of-the-art robotic technology and integrated heat treatment capabilities for cold extruded aluminum parts. 
 We currently do not have any vacancies. 
 Living and working in Raufoss 
 Raufoss, with its approximately 7,000 inhabitants, is the center and the administrative capital of the district of Vestre Toten, in the county of Oppland in the center of Norway. Raufoss is also a stop on the Gjøvikbanen, a Norwegian railway line that operates between Oslo and Gjøvik. The Vestre Toten district, itself with 13,000 residents, is 100 kilometers north of the capital city of Oslo, and only 60 kilometers south of Lillehammer, site of the 1994 Winter Olympics. Though primarily agricultural in nature, the landscape of this region is also known for its productive forests. Countless lakes and ponds dot the region and provide hours of enjoyment for the nature-lover. The river Hunnselva flows northward from Lake Einafjorden through Raufoss to the Lake Mjøsa in Gjøvik. It is distinguished as the only northward-flowing river in all of Norway. In addition to its natural charms, the town of Raufoss also has an active football club that plays in the second Norwegian division. What’s more, Raufoss has a lively music scene where well-known musicians such as Ronni Le Tekrø from the rock band TNT have gotten their start. Here is just a small sample of the many attractions nearby:
