 How job coaches could soon be doctoring your medical records 
 Morning Star – 3rd March 2016 
 pilot scheme in London sees medical experts tasked with getting the jobless back to work. It’s a frightening taste of the future, writes LINDA BURNIP 
 ON FRIDAY, members of Disabled People Against Cuts (DPAC), Mental Health Resistance Network (MHRN) and Boycott Workfare will be protesting together with medical professionals against the placement of job coaches in seven Islington doctors’ surgeries.

 In September 2015, the ‘Working Better’ pilot scheme was launched 
 What is the scheme about? 
 Under the scheme, unemployed residents, who face long-term, health-related barriers to work can volunteer to be referred by their GP for personalised employment coaching, offered on a one-to-one basis at their GP surgery.

 DWP ‘ruined me’ with ‘victimisation’, says disabled benefit claimant 
 DNS - 4th March 2016 
 A disabled man has accused the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) of victimising him and ruining his life after it tried – and failed – to prosecute him for benefit fraud, despite letters from medical professionals confirming his serious medical conditions. 
 The case of Gary Moyse has shone a spotlight on DWP’s use of fraud investigators, and of secret filmed footage in cases where a claimant has a serious but fluctuating condition.

 I will repeat it @geoff 
 It’s so serious @geoff, it ought to be investigated by the police. 
The ATOS nurse EMMA BRODRICK should be dragged through the courts and sued for every penny she has. 
Even a prison sentence is not harsh enough for these twisted bastards that play with peoples lives. 
How many more disabled people has she hurt in her quest for easy money? 
 More to the point, how many have died? 
 She has probably moved across to MAXIMUS. They pay mega bucks to murder claimants.

 Geoff - I completely agree with Sarah7 - this despicable woman should be hunted down and her sorry arse dragged through the Courts. 
It sounds like there is enough evidence and through the 'people tracing' assets/companies available in this day and age I would imagine that she could be found if required. There cannot be too many "Emma Brodrick"s around in Britain!

 CAMERON WANTS YOU TO OPEN A SINGAPOREAN FORTUNE ACCOUNT TO DRAW ON IF YOU FALL ILL. 
you fund it yourself 
 The Government plans to introduce a “Help to Save” scheme for low-paid workers to build up a rainy day fund. 
 But with details of the scheme still under wraps, savings insiders believe such a scheme may look more like insurance than a typical savings account. 
 The Prime Minister David Cameron said this week: “We intend to bring forward a ‘Help to Save’ scheme to encourage those on low incomes to build up a rainy day fund.” 
 The scheme will be outlined in full at the March 16 Budget, he added. 
 Schemes like this exist in other countries - Singaporeans pay into Fortune Accounts which combine insurance and savings elements and pay out when they are sick. 
 One advocate of the scheme is free market thinktank The Adam Smith Institute. 
 In 1995 it published a report praising Fortune Accounts, which concluded: "Some party, some government, will have to replace the welfare state by a less destructive alternative. The Fortune Account is the shape of its replacement." 
 The Government has been in discussions with Legal & General, an insurance provider, over its suggestion of a workplace income protection scheme which pays out if you fall ill. 
 Legal & General sees this as a way of building on auto-enrolment, which allows workers to join company pension schemes and save into a private pension that will boost their future retirement income. 
 With statutory sick pay at just £88.45 a week, there is no doubt that low-paid workers could benefit from more support if they fall ill. In fact, many of us already choose to fork out for protection insurance in case something goes wrong. 
 The question is whether a 'help to save' scheme will boost your income, or simply replace money coming from existing benefits.

 This makes me realise how lucky I actually am! I'm currently off sick I managed to drop some heavy play equipment on my foot at work yesterday (I work in a school). 
THEY sent me home today and gave me a lift. And I'll be paid for the time. 
My heart goes out to everyone who is persecuted by this evil government!

 UNUM PROVIDENT 
This sounds rather like the re-introduction of the "Back up plan", that was advertised by UNUM insurance briefly in late 2011. Just before the Welfare reform bill was voted on in the house. Conveniently for them, the chief advisors to the government and Lord Fraud on Welfare reform, were…… UNUM insurance. 
Documents even came to light, on how their sales operatives could demonstrate to employers, that the people who worked for them would eventually get very little or no money in sickness benefits from the state, so it would be advisable to invest in UNUM's employee income protection plans. The "Back up Plan" was heavily advertised on television for about three months, before people realised, who was promoting it, suddenly it disappeared never to be heard of again. 
It just seems oh so very strange, that an insurance company that has been described as an "outlaw company" by the California insurance regulator, and has had to pay out millions in penalties for wrongful denial of disability claims in the USA, is suddenly capable of giving such "wise"??? advice here. The question is, wise for whom?

 "HOWS THIS FOR BEING EMBARRASSING TO THE DWP" 
 From: J Hicks 
 24 August 2015 
 Dear Department for Work and Pensions, 
 Children with Heart Defects being refused DLA 
 How many children with heart defects who have previously been 
receiving DLA have been refused this support in 2015 ? 
 Are children with heart defects being targeted by the government to 
reduce costs for support ? 
 Yours faithfully, 
 J Hicks 
 …………………………………………………………………………………………………… 
DWP ANSWER 
 DWP Response 
 We can confirm that the Department does hold some information falling within the description 
specified in your request. However, we estimate that the cost of complying with your request 
would exceed the appropriate limit of £600. The appropriate limit has been specified in 
regulations and for central Government it is set at £600. This represents the estimated cost of 
one person spending 3½ working days in determining whether the Department holds the 
information, and locating, retrieving and extracting the information. Under section 12 of the 
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) the Department is not obliged to comply with your request 
and we will not be processing your request further.

 I honestly cannot come to terms with what i have just read. 
 Children with heart defects being denied Disability Living Allowance. 
 Who or what from the dark vestiges of hell could put a childs life at risk? 
Only one of Mark Swastikas PCS thugs that derive pleasure from reading of their conquests in the obituary columns, surely? 
 After the first few deaths, killing becomes a lot easier. A bit like riding a bike for the first time. 
 There is no difference between pulling a life saving treatment from a childs arm or disability denial, the result is the same.

 Bedroom tax campaigner’s ‘contempt’ for ministers who forced his family to fight 
 One of the disabled campaigners whose “bedroom tax” cases were heard in the Supreme Court this week has spoken of his “contempt” for ministers who have forced them to spend years fighting for their rights through the legal system. 
 Paul Rutherford said it was tough and even “scary” to take on the government, but that he and his wife Susan “owe it to all disabled people to see it through”, despite a legal battle that began in 2013. 
 He said: “I have nothing but contempt for anyone who can put people like us through this, just by making a policy that is ideological and hasn’t saved money.” 
 The Supreme Court was asked this week to deliver a final ruling on whether the bedroom tax discriminates “unjustifiably” against disabled people. 
 The court heard evidence concerning six disabled people, who have all been struggling since the introduction three years ago of what the government calls its spare room subsidy removal policy. 
 Disabled activists were outside the Supreme Court in Westminster to show their support for the disabled people and carers who have spent years trying to persuade the courts that they should be exempted from the bedroom tax.

 "WELL DONE" 
 Disability rights activists, trade unionists and healthcare professionals blocked a major central London junction on Friday afternoon in protest against plans to embed job advisers with family doctors. 
 Traffic news warned motorists to avoid Old Street roundabout at the height of rush hour after about 100 protesters blocked traffic for about 30 minutes while following a demonstration outside a nearby GP practice. 
 Campaigners are furious about a scheme being piloted in Islington in which long-term sickness benefit claimants – in particular those with mental health problems – are offered sessions with job coaches in an effort to return them to work.

 That vagabond should be given six months hard labour. What right does he have to cajole and accost citizens on the high street, just so that he can get money to feed his addictions. He is a vagabond. And it is deplorable that these people think that they have the right to "beg" from citizens. He should be in a British version of a FEMA camp, going cold turkey and eventually being retrained to work in a charity shop for his JSA. Prefferably a Heart Foundation store as the staff are as miserable as fuck in there. 
Roger Has Spoken.

 All of us (whether we can actually afford it or not, - or are working or not, or are on benefits or not) have to pay at least 25% of our Council Tax! 
This is where all of OUR money goes when we PAY our Council Tax!

 Whilst watching one of my favourite programmes this evening (Grand Designs) - on More4+ Channel - I was confronted with this:- 
"You can Supercharge Paralympics GB 
Text SUPER to 70070 to donate £5 
SUPERCHARGE PARALYMPICS GB 
paralympics.org.uk/supercharge 
#supercharge 
Each text donates £5 to British Paralympic Association (Charity 802385 England/Wales) 
Your standard network charges apply" 
 Whilst I realise that Channel 4 is the so-called "Official Paralympics Broadcaster" as they now call themselves - I really object to the fact that they are "appealing for funds" and also making 'real' disabled people look 'more' than what they are actually are and 'more' that they can actually achieve - at least in the eyes of the 'general public' - the 'sheople' or 'sheeple'. It is really demeaning and it is also very patronising as far as I am personally concerned.

 All of the 'real' disabled people that I know of cannot, in any way take part in any 'Paralympics' whatsoever. 
They have all that they can do to look after themselves everyday. 
Every day for them is a total struggle to survive - both physically and also financially. 
Fuck Channel 4 - And fuck the 'Paralympics'. These 'Paralympians' are only after one thing - fame and fortune and also the highest possible medals. 
THESE 'PARALYMPIANS' ARE NOT 'FULLY' DISABLED - THEY MAY BE 'PARTIALLY' DISABLED, - BUT THEY ARE ONLY AFTER ONE THING - 'FORTUNE' AND 'FAME'.

 When are you filthy rabble gonna understand, You don't get anywhere by protesting, demonstrating or rioting. You get somewhere by being polite and asking for concessions nicely. As the great working class hero, John Major once said, "You know you are winning the argument when you're opponent starts to shout and swear." 
And you know what, he was right. He was always right. And you, You vitriolic, rancid rabble of shitehawks, you need to remember that when your out there, protesting, your bitter little faces all screwed up with impotent rage,

 Roger what's that new movie, Oh yes 'London is down', just like John Major was when he took over from Thatcher. The book by Max Hastings, 'The Editor' shows how Major couldn't lead a jazz band never mind a country. He was more than grey he was puce.

 Roger - You may well have spoken and indeed, you may well be right - but there are far too many people on here. Far, by far too many for you for ever to comprehend. You, my (not) friend do not realise exactly what you are saying. Margaret Thatcher - your 'hero' eventually fell and 'died' with advancing dementia (felled by her own Conservative administration!). John Major - an increasingly very weak and totally failed 'Prime Minister' - felled by his 'Conservative' colleagues and 'Ministers'! 
WHEN ARE YOU, ROGER GOING TO GET A REAL 'JOB' AND STOP ATTACKING EVERYONE ON HERE. 
I HAVE GOT A JOB, ROGER - WHAT IS YOURS - DO YOU HAVE A JOB?
