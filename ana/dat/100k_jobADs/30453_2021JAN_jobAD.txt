 About this project 
 it-programming / others-5 
 USD 100 - 250 
 I need an analytical video software in Spanish/English with: 
*Perimeter movement sensor (as shown in the videos sent and by the images sent by you at the beginning of the conversation). 
*Object tracking, (as shown in the videos sent). 
*People counting and facial recognition (with database this recognition is to validate the entry and exit of authorized personnel). 
 
 Have a minimum database for 5000 records that will serve for facial recognition. 
*Must be able to send emails (minimum 5 accounts) with images by generated alerts and view the  cameras from a mobile device. 
*Additionally the software must send emails and images simultaneously for each alert and generate metrics of the events. 
 The software will be hosted on a server or in the cloud and will be installed remotely, so you must work with WiFi. 
 This includes an app to view the cameras remotely. 
 A dashboard that generates the metrics. 
 The dashboard with the metrics must be accessed with a password. 
 Send emails with alerts and images of the events and photo of the person who approaches or stays longer than allowed in the delimited area (polygon). 
 Software, dashboard and APP would go with our brand. 
 It has to be closed code. 
 The use would be for all IP cameras without distinction of brands or models. 
 Bi-directional audio. 
 As you can see in the videos, areas must be delimited so that nobody can access at pre-established times and also send images and alerts in case this polygon is accessed.
