  How Do I Make Sure My Resume Gets Looked At?  
 Work It Daily 
 April 14, 2009 
 Dear Experts, I recently sent my resume to an organization that I know starts hiring in April for a seasonal event. With all the resumes they receive and internal referrals, I want to make sure my resume is looked at. What is the protocol for following up with a phone call about possible positions? I don't want to come off as annoying but I know that in some cases persistence can pay off. Also, what is the best way to approach a company/organization for an informational meeting? I would like to simple introduce myself and have them put a face to a resume if something comes up in the future.  Our Twitter Advice Project (T.A.P.) is no longer an active campaign.
