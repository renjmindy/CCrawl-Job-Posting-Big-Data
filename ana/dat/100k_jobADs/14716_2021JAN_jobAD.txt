 Finding inspiration as we launch our Job Coaching service! 
 **Welcome to The Kudos Group 's first ever blog! We hope you'll keep readingâ€¦ ** 
 As we are about to launch our new offering -  www.myjobcoach.co.uk  - I ( Sandra Webber , Director here at Kudos) am thinking about who has inspired me this week in the world of work? The answer: two people at opposite ends of the career journey! 
 Person one is a character from a recent programme on a Channel 4 Documentary - Fabulous Fashionistas - who still loved her job and she was 87! Check out the trailer: 
 (Full documentary: http://www.channel4.com/programmes/fabulous-fashionistas/4od) 
 The moral of the story here, to coin a phrase and a familiar hashtag, is - #dosomethingyoulove 
 **The other person I found inspiring, was a young graduate who had secured a job - fresh out of uni. **The job was going well, he loved the team, his manager was good, everything looked perfect until he was called into the office and told that due to financial pressure they were making redundancies! He was understandably devastated; the career he thought he had embarked on came to an abrupt end without any warning. 
 As I type, to his credit and with help from a supportive recruitment agency, he is being interviewed for another good role - only 3 working days later! Fingers crossed he is back in employment soon - and he will have acquired a valuable skill in the process by learning to cope with change. 
 So here is my reflection on the week and advice to all of you out there looking for your first ever position, promotion, or a career change: 
 Find a job you love to do and learn to adapt quickly to change.
