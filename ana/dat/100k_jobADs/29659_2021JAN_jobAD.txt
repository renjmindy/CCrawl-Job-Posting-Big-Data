 Proposal Report: Axial Loading behavior of Tri-tubular conical ener... 
 Published: 4 months ago  Deadline: 11 Bids: 3 
 Need help in doing report on the topic below: 
In this project, Tri-tubular conical energy absorber will be designed, fabricated and tested under axial compression loading. Aluminum and glass/epoxy materials with one natural fiber/epoxy material will be used to fabricate cones and tubes of a different design arrangements. In addition to the tri-tubular conical energy absorber components, axial loading will be performed on bi-tubular cone-tube and single tube and cone components. 
Maximum Height and minimum diameter of the energy absorber components will be 120 mm and 56 mm respectively. Effects of cone and tube design parameters, material used and cone semi apical angle on the axial compression load-displacement relation and on the specific energy absorption will be drawn and discussed for all the tested tube and cone arrangements. In addition, maximum crush force efficiency and stroke efficiency will be determined and discussed. 
Crashworthiness analysis with final comparison will be performed on the results obtained from all the tested cone.

 Rendering done for a real estate project with 10 tiny houses 
 Published: 5 months ago  Bids: 6 
 I need a rendering done for a tiny house project to be built. It is 10 tiny houses. If you are using a free program do not respond. 
 If you use a program like Lumion 10.5 it will work for my project and I can get the right outcome. You will not be able to provide the requirements with a free version.  I have attached the property and views of the lake. 
 The dimesions are 50 by 40 meters each house has 20 meters of land. The property is on a sloap I need views of the lake. I am sending an example of the units and the way we want this to look. 
 It will be a sunset view with a the firepits and a Gazebo in the middle of the community. I want to know how long it will take for a draft. I want to see a draft before you do the whole job. 
 I have not had any luck with a prior freelancer. He could not do it. Using a free program from sketchup.I am sending over what he did to show this is now what I want. 
 The images are nothing like my property. It looks like a cartoon as you can  see.You  can see the actual lake and land in my photos and in a video on you tube link attached.
