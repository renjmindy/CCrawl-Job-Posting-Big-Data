Dedicated staff are available to help you articulate your military skills and communicate them effectively to civilian employers, connect with veteran-friendly employers, and access benefits specifically available to support veterans.

 WorkSource Montgomery provides “Priority of Service” to veterans and their eligible spouses in accordance with the Jobs for Veterans Act of 2002 and the Veterans’ Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006. Veteran trained staff assist veteran customers by making sure they have their veteran information correctly displayed in MWE so as to receive priority service.
