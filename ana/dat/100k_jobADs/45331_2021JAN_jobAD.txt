  5 Career Paths in Disaster Management  
 2U 
 November 14, 2012 
 Over the past 30 years, the planet has seen a steady rise in weather-related and geological natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, and last week’s devastating Hurricane Sandy. There have also been large-scale disasters of man-made origins, such the 9/11 World Trade Center attacks. While these situations culminated in staggering amounts of damage and the loss of life, many hard lessons were learned from them and a new urgency to save lives in future disasters is gaining momentum. For those who want to choose an altruistic and truly life-saving  career path , there are many opportunities in the professional field of disaster management. Three of the most prominent U.S. organizations in the field are FEMA, the American Red Cross and the National Guard. The  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)  is a part of the United States Department of Homeland Security and is responsible for federal emergency relief when local and state authorities become overwhelmed in a declared State of Emergency. The  American Red Cross  is a humanitarian organization led by volunteers and offers services in five areas besides domestic disaster management: helping the homeless and the needy; the organization of blood drives; education for preparedness, health and safety; communication and comfort services for military members and their families; and international relief and development. The  U.S. National Guard  is a reserve military force made up of part-time members who hold full-time civilian jobs. Among the many duties they perform, they provide security and transport during evacuations and have engineers to address dangerous situations and trouble spots. Between the three organizations, the enlistment and volunteer attendance is in the tens of thousands, with plenty of demand for those with skills that can be applied to disaster management. Of the various career positions in disaster management, here are five:
