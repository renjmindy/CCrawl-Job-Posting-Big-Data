 When Your Workers Compensation Benefits Are Less Than the Costs of Your Workplace Injury 
 You might benefit from the services of a Hauppauge on the job injury lawyer from our firm if you have been treated unfairly after sustaining a work injury. Depending on the nature of your injury, your accident costs might be very costly. In addition to medical fees, you may also be out of work for some time and unable to earn your regular income. If your injury is permanent or long term, you may be out of work indefinitely. In addition, serious injuries often require significant physical rehabilitation. 
 As a result, the insurance company may very well try to avoid paying out what will likely be an enormous sum of money. This is not fair to you, the injured worker. At Polsky, Shouldice & Rosen, P.C., each of our on the job injury lawyer in Hauppauge makes every effort to right the wrongs perpetrated by insurance companies. Give a  Hauppauge on the job injury lawyer  a call today at (718) 875-0909 to find out how we may be of assistance to you. There will be no charge for this phone call. 
 Permanent or Long-Term Disability 
 When a workplace injury is especially serious, it can result in permanent injury or long-term disability. Even if full recovery is possible, the employee’s job may no longer be available or suitable for them once they are ready to return to work. As a result, the injured worker may lose out on a substantial amount of income as well as bonuses and other benefits. 
 A Hauppauge on the job injury lawyer from our firm may be able to help you recover these losses. Request a free consultation today to find out more about your legal options. You can reach us at (718) 875-0909. If it is not convenient for you to come to our office, one of our attorneys can discuss your case with you over the phone. If you are hospitalized because of your injury, we can come to your location. 
 Common Damages Associated with Serious Workplace Injuries 
 In the immediate aftermath of an accident at work, it may not be apparent the extent or seriousness of the resulting injury. In fact, the true nature of a workplace injury may not be evident for months. In addition, the time required to recover may take longer than anticipated and a full recovery may not be possible, depending on the injury. 
 Each Hauppauge on the job injury lawyer from our firm understands this all too well. Very often, an injured employee will accept a workers’ compensation benefits package that is far less than the full costs of the injury. We can help you avoid that outcome. Here are some of the most common costs associated with serious injuries that not all workers realize they may face: 
 · Physical rehabilitation 
· Medical devices such as crutches, shower chair, spinal pillows, etc. 
· Multiple surgeries 
· Medications 
· Unearned wages while out of work 
· Transportation costs to and from doctor’s appointments, surgeries, etc.
