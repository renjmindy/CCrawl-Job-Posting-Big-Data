 How to Care for a Newly Painted Vehicle 
 So, you just got a brand new car paint job. Your ride is looking crisp and beautiful. But, how do you go about keeping it looking that way? 
 The solutions are actually a lot easier than you may thing - and no, they do not all involve keeping your car in a pressurized room and never driving it. 
 Here are some tips for taking care of that brand new car paint job: 
 Know how to clean it 
 When cleaning a new car paint job, make sure to avoid using detergents or cleaners. These can be harsh and damage your paint job. If it is the summertime, you should wash your car with cold water, and (ideally) in the shade. However, if it is winter, you should use warm water. Once you finish washing the car, make sure you wipe off any water sports with a chamois, or a soft cloth. 
 Wax free for 90 days 
 While you may be tempted to try and protect your new car paint job by getting a wax or a polish right away, try and hold off. You should not use any type of sealant product on a new paint job for at least 90 days. 
 Cold weather care 
 If you get a new car paint job within the winter months, you will want to make sure that you have hidden areas (like under the fender) pressure washed to remove road salt that can decay the paint. You also want to avoid scraping snow and ice from painted surfaces (let it melt, or brush it off.) 
 Avoid parking under trees 
 Parking under trees can cause sap, water, or other debris to unnecessarily fall onto your car, damaging the new paint job. Likewise, avoid parking near facilities that produce lots of smoke.

 It's a good thing you mentioned that it's important to take care of a newly-done paint job on any vehicle-even if you're extremely tempted to wax the car right away after a new paint job it's best to hold off on it. The reason for this is because the paint needs time to set before you can go ham with waxing down the car. If I had the chance to bring a car in for a new paint job I would ask the people in charge about how to take care of the car immediately after getting the paint job done.
