 “All I wanted was to live a life where I could be me, and be okay with that. I had no need for material possessions, money or even close friends with me on my journey. I never understood people very well anyway, and they never seemed to understand me very well either. All I wanted was my art and the chance to be the creator of my own world, my own reality. I wanted the open road and new beginnings every day.” ― Charlotte Eriksson

 HUNTED: Chapter 15 
 November 8, 2020  /  @labriejames  /  Leave a comment 
 Hey Guys!!! Thank you much for your patience with me. I started a new Pampered Chef Biz and things just TOOK OFF. It's been impossible to keep up on my everyday life. I decided to go off-the-grid for a few hours today so I can't get this eagerly awaited chapter out to you! Let me …  Continue reading HUNTED: Chapter 15

 The air was heavy between us as we sat around the coffee table again. I took my usual place on the loveseat and he took his usual place on the floor, propped against the futon. I curled my knees to my chest and started to trace my teeth with my fingers while I waited for him to say something. Anything.

 I reach out and cradle his face in my hands, my thumbs resting below his eyes, catching his tears. “Me too, Jax, me too.” He rests his forehead on my shoulder and wraps his arms around me tightly. My arms squeeze around his neck and I feel him start to shake. We stay like that for awhile, crying together, grieving together, trying to find solace. 
 HUNTED: Chapter Ten

 “I just witnessed my best friend get murdered and survived two gunshots! If I feel like getting drunk I am going too.” I snap. They were right though, I never drank. It wasn’t my thing but hours ago we laid Juliet to rest and I realized that her murderer could have been watching us, or me rather, for awhile. Call me crazy but that was a hard pill to swallow. 
 HUNTED: Chapter Seven

 My mom always told me that beauty is achieved, not genetic. In other words she was firm believer in self-made, store bought perfection. I think she said this because her daughter was born just shy of beautiful, a mutant if you well. It was her way of trying to make me feel pretty but never once have I taken her actions as a compliment. Dad tells me I’m the green apple in a sea of red ones. A unique find, an acquired taste. In the end all I ever felt was less then. Never greater then. 
 I'm Not God

 I'm not sure what the right word is, ignorant maybe? I feel as though I am at a loss for words. It's not writers block as much as it is guilt of the mind. I have no clue what needs to be said and how to say it. My mother would never say anything, her …  Continue reading I'm Not God
