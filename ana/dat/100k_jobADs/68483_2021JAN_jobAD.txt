  Are You on Google Plus? 3 Ways it Will Affect Your Job Search  
 Heather Huhman 
 October 04, 2011 
 Google Plus has taken the Internet by storm. The  latest numbers  say 13% of U.S. adults have already signed up for the service and, in a year, that number could reach 22%; making Google Plus the number two social media network and leaving LinkedIn and Twitter behind. A lot of folks are excited about this platform, mostly because it addresses some of the flaws of existing social networks—such as organizing your contacts, distributing content to the right audience, and allowing for group video chat, among other things.  Recruiters, human resource professionals and hiring managers are particularly interested in figuring out Google Plus for sourcing job candidates.  Unlike Facebook, Google Plus allows for searching and finding candidate whom they are not connected with, and the platform certainly has more to offer than LinkedIn thus far. Here are some things  Google Plus  offers that can have a substantial effect on your job search: 
 
 
 Enhanced privacy settings.  Not only can you share specific information with Circles of your choosing, but you can also opt to share information publicly—meaning potential employers or other influential connections (whom you’re not already connected with) can see it, too. Instead of worrying about privacy, you can use it to your advantage. 
 More conversation.  The platform encourages interaction through content sharing, status updates, online and video chats (Hangouts). Want to learn more about something a hiring manager posted? Ask about it! Interested in speaking face-to-face with a networking connection? Set up a chat to talk with them in more depth. 
 Greater online visibility.  If you choose to make your profile public, it will be easier than ever for you to be found online. Although the search capabilities of Google Plus don’t include some specifics yet, surely they will in the future. (So, be sure to complete your profile to help potential employers find you!)
