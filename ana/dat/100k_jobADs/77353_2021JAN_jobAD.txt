 We’re looking for somebody to help us create and maintain an online infrastructure that supports millions of concurrent players in a secure, stable, highly performant and reliable manner. You’ll be using a wide combination of the latest AWS, Google Cloud and web technologies (Lambda/Cloud Functions using C# and JavaScript, Node.js, Terraform/Serverless, Cognito/Firebase, DynamoDB/Bigtable, Docker/Kubernetes etc) to allow us to dynamically scale a fleet of containerized, .NET Core based game servers. Perhaps you already have experience with many of these technologies, or perhaps you've got a proven track record in taking on similarly complex challenges. 
 Ideally, you’ll be Melbourne based and already hold a Visa allowing you to work in Australia. We’ll consider a remote position for the right candidate, if you’re willing to be available with crossover during Australian business hours.  ‍

 WORK CULTURE

Team happiness and fulfillment is essential for our business to be successful, and we know that means a respectful work/life balance. 
 We are an equal opportunity employer and encourage diverse applications. 
 If you can tick most of the requirements for a role but not all,  please do contact us . We are always interested to see candidates who could grow into an advertised role. Don't let the list of attributes scare you off if you feel a role is really you.
