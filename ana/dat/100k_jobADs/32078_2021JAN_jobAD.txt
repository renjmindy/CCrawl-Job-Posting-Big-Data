 Are you passionate about cycling? 
 Are you fanatical about health, fitness and community? 
 Does poor customer service bother you? 
 If the answer to all of the above is yes - please read on! 
 I'm looking for expertise in web design, e-commerce, property acquisition and accounting / financial management. I have a business concept that fills a gap in the market, at a time where the cycling / fitness industry is in a golden era - with a view to scale into some of the world's major cities. I have a strong operational background in leisure & hospitality, a great network and an MBA education. 
 I'm looking for 1-2 co-founders, and an advisory team who can help refine the concept, and put the wheels in motion (!) to get this venture moving quickly. I'm as passionate about my concept as I am about people. 
 Given this is at concept stage, there is no salary...yet. 
 If you're interested - drop me a CV!
