 New Year! New Things! 
 So it's been a busy year (and …uh… change) since Don't Quit Your Day Job went on hiatus. I've been distracted by improv and a new-found fiber arts gang and all manner of other mischief, but the biggest, most all-consuming distraction of the last year has been the addition of a truly precious little girl to the family, and my big sister's long-overdue promotion to "Mom". So she and her cousin are the stars of the comic marking their aunt's triumphant return to late nights cursing at my computer and unsteady drawing hand. You all remember  Missy . Now meet JoJo. 
 I have a whole pile of new things in store, so stick around friends.

 Good thing we're not paying them by the word… 
 Don't Quit Your Day Job 
 Improvised Charles Dickens ? What could possibly go wrong? 
 I am somewhat relieved to say that rehearsals have not  actually  devolved into Dickensian Speech for Sport …yet. 
 I've had the privilege of lighting this show, and it has been one ridiculous and amazing Victorian-era tale after another. We've had a happy family of morticians, a secret society of lamplighters, and one ill-advised voyage to Australia. There are top hats and tragic deaths, fancy accents and small children who speak above their age and station, all served up with the usual spontaneity and mischief that come with improvised narrative. 
 We will round the halfway point of the run this weekend, and I can't wait to see what the second month will bring.

 Trick  and  Treat 
 Don't Quit Your Day Job 
 Apologies for the low quality. The last-minute gag seemed like a good idea. Drawing a comic with the fancy pens and India ink seemed like a good idea. Doing both at the same time… did not quite produce the desired results, but I didn't really have time to start over before Halloween was over. So here you go - a little window into my drawing process. 
 I may feel compelled to clean it up later in the week, if I have time. 
 Speaking of time, I guess now is as good a time as any to make this official: 
 The comic will be on a sort of hiatus for a while. The holidays are always insane for me, and this year I'm even more behind on projects than usual, so the comic can't have a monopoly on my precious evening hours. I may do a low-tech, scan-in comic like this one when inspiration strikes. 
 More importantly, I have a large backlog of completed projects that I haven't blogged about yet. So there should be more non-comic posts coming in the next month or two! 
 I've also been wanting to step back for a while and work on the comic - I already have some upgrades in the works for Page and Karen, and I have some new characters I've been itching to add. So look forward to that in the new year!

 On Bird-Watching 
 Don't Quit Your Day Job 
 I've been out in Central Texas for almost two years now, yet I'm still losing my shit every time I spot one of these guys - much less the  three  that appear to live - or at least feed - right along my daily commute route. In my defense, several of my coworkers who have lived out here much longer than I have are just as thrilled as I am with our neighborhood roadrunners.

 Running rings around the competition 
 Don't Quit Your Day Job 
 I blame  Phil Plait . His blog is an unending stream of pretty space pictures, and he’s been getting  a little Saturn-happy  lately. 
 I mean, are these Cassini pictures not the prettiest things you ever did see?
