 The Bloomberg Middle Office Core Services team specializes in the development and management of post-trade workflows in the financial industry. Currently, we support post-trade workflows for 8000+ firms globally. Services developed by the group include VCON(Voice affirmation), Allocation processing, FX CMS (FX matching and settlement), and SSMO (TOMS/SSEOMS Middle Office). Our focus areas are to harmonize the post-trade stack for our clients to manage their operational processes efficiently. This involves understanding existing workflows (internal and external) and utilizing appropriate technology to transform the post-trade landscape. 
 We are looking for someone with a solid understanding of OOP and design skills. The ideal candidate should be passionate and focused on building complex applications for performance and stability along with ease of support and maintenance.

The ideal candidate would also demonstrate compatibility in working in a fast-paced environment and flexibility to adapt to changes as required.

Our current technology stack includes comdb2/postgres/SOLR for data storage, XML/JSON/BAS as data protocol, and RabbitMQ/Kafka/BAS as middleware. Most of our services are written in C++ and integration tests are written in Python. Our SDLC process includes hosting all repositories on GitHub and leveraging GitHub/Phabricator for code reviews, static analysis, continuous integration, and continuous deployment done by Jenkins. We use Jira to facilitate Agile practice and conduct scrum meetings, and utilize bi-weekly sprints and quarterly Product Increments for short term and long term plannings. 
 The team is responsible for engineering the next generation of post-trade applications leveraging latest and most suitable technologies to achieve high capacity, scalability, and extensibility to existing and future integrations, with including but not limited to internal products such as VCON, AIM, TOMS, TSOX, EMSX, and external OMS/EMS/Third-party systems.
