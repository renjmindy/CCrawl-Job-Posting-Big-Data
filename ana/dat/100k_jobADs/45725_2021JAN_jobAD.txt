 Do you have a strong knowledge base in and around Machine Tool / CNC equipment from a Sales or Applications / Service Engineering perspective? Are you feeling unchallenged and stagnant in your current role or perhaps want to take that knowledge and utilise it to grow and develop a customer base who want to own and develop their machining businesses with some of the most advanced and highest value CNC equipment on the planet? 
 This leading global business sells market leading Machine Tool equipment across the UK and Europe and then supports, manages and services their equipment across a variety of blue chip and private customers across a variety of sectors including; Aerospace, Automotive, Oil & Gas and Industrial Engineering. Their product set can range from £100K to £4M in value and their approach is one of relationship building, consultative sales and their machines are very much sold on capability, support and quality and not price which very much differentiates them in the market place. 
 The Sales Executive will be responsible for a geographical patch in the East of the UK, covering Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, East Anglia and Bedfordshire and will be responsible for building upon and developing their existing client base as well as building a pipeline of future customers in their area. This will be a mixture of account management and new business acquisition and will require an inquisitive but patient sales approach in order to identify new sales opportunities and turning them into sales over a period of time. 
 You will be hungry to sell but have the relationship in mind first and foremost and always be looking at the bigger picture and the reputation and quality of service of the business as a whole picture. This is not a quick sell but one that requires tenacity and patience coupled with the ability to close a deal when the time comes. 
 In return this growing and progressive business offers a market leading base salary with a very strong commission scheme, high spec company car, pension, healthcare provision and the opportunity to develop your career in an organisation rife with opportunity. Please get in touch with Matt Harris to discuss this fantastic opportunity in more detail.
