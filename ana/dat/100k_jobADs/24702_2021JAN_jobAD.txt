 Whacko Environmentalists - 0 Mankind - 1 
 Posted on  September 1, 2010  by  writerchick 
   
 
 
 Now I've been telling you folks that these greenie whackjobs were over the top - maybe now you'll believe me. 
 Apparently a whacko nutjob environmentalist thinks that dirty filthy human beings should be gotten rid of and to prove the passion of his belief took hostages at the _Discovery Channel 's _headquarters (Yes, the Discovery Channel, not BP Oil or a major filthy carbon footprint emitting corporate entity - but the Discovery Channel) . They think he had a bomb strapped to him but the cans were recycled so, it could be that used fertilizer and coffee grounds just don't detonate properly. 
 Long story short - the police didn't mess around considering thousands of lives were at risk and now he is one dead whacko environmentalist. To prove it here are some of his thoughts as voiced on his website (which I will not cite because I don't think crazy people deserve increased blog traffic), courtesy of ABC News: 
 
 Lee writes that the channel should cease its current programming and replace it with a game show about reducing the global population. 
 The channel, he wrote, should produce a program about "how people can live WITHOUT giving birth to more filthy human children since those new additions continue pollution and are pollution." 
 "The world needs TV shows that DEVELOP solutions to the problems that humans are causing, not stupify the people into destroying the world. Not encouraging them to breed more environmentally harmful humans," he wrote. 
 "Saving the environment and the remaning [sic] species diversity of the planet is now your mindset. Nothing is more important than saving them. The Lions, Tigers, Giraffes, Elephants, Froggies, Turtles, Apes, Raccoons, Beetles, Ants, Sharks, Bears, and, of course, the Squirrels. . . The humans? The planet does not need humans," he wrote. 
 
 This  article describes the ordeal  in full. 
 Well, Mr. Lee, I suppose I should congratulate you on acheiving your objective, at least in part - because now there is one less filthy human being on the planet. I'm sure the lions and tigers and bears are really jazzed too.
