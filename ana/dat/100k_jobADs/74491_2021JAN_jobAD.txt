 Number of Times Seen  â€“ 1 (23 Dec 2015) 
 Brief Synopsis  â€“ A biopic of the volatile genius Steve Jobs during three pivotal moments in his life. 
 My Take on it  â€“ I have always been a huge fan of Aaron Sorkin's writing; whether it be for TV shows (West Wing, Studio 60, Sports Night and The Newsroom) or for film ( Malice  (1993),  A Few Good Men  (1992), Charlie Wilson's War (2007) and  The Social Network  (2010). 
 I believe that he truly is one of the best writers around because of the way that he writes engaging conversations between characters (usually while walking) ðŸ™‚ 
 He once again writes some amazing conversations in this movie between the characters and it's quite easy to see Sorkin's hand in these dialogue sessions. 
 Unfortunately, I felt the story itself, and the way it is presented to us quite lacking. 
 Biopic usually take one of two forms; either giving an overview of the characters entire life or giving us a look at a pivotal time in their life. 
 This movie tries to give us a bit of both and falters because it tries to show us three pivotal events in Jobs' life that helped shape who he was but none of them feel complete enough. 
 Michael Fassbender is amazing as Jobs and shows his volatile temperament. 
 Kate Winslet is great as his loyal assistant who helps him throughout his professional career. 
 I had higher expectations for this film and this unfortunately just didn't meet those expectations. 
 Bottom Line  - Amazing dialogue written by Sorkin, but the story itself doesn't flow well enough and would have probably been much better if it had been filmed as a normal biopic instead of in three segments. Fassbender and Winslet are both great here but the material is a bit lacking. 
 MovieRob 's Favorite Trivia -  The three sequences in the film were filmed on 16mm, 35mm, and digital to illustrate the advancement in Apple's technology across the 16 years depicted of Jobs' life. (From  IMDB ) **

 Rating  â€“ BAFTA Worthy

 I agree with this one too, love the performance and style of the film but if you didn't know anything about Jobs, Apple etc you would be left pretty lost watching this

 Good analysis Rob. Sorkin definitely was bold with the structure here. But his dialogue was top notch as per usual. I found this story as exciting as an action flick actually. I didn't expect the movie to be framed around his best productâ€¦ his daughterâ€¦ and how she secretly inspires him. I was expecting it to be about Apple, but enjoyed the focus on the man's abandoment and control issues instead. Loved the performances too. Your opening quote is great because of the impact it lands with in the proper context.
