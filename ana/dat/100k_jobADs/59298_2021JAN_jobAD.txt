  The Most Demanding Careers In Alternative Medicine  
 Swati Chawla 
 June 20, 2014 
 The world of alternative medicine is wide, beginning from Chinese medication and reaching to massage therapy. If compared to most of the Western medical methods, alternative healthcare often looks for taking an insight to know the deeper cause of illness, instead of simply dealing with the symptoms of it.  Related:   5 Awesome Healthcare Careers With Salaries Over 100k  Alternative medicine practitioners do not perform surgeries on patients or even recommend drugs, rather they believe in the concept of herbal and natural remedies clubbed with homeopathy and massage therapy. 
 
 Concept Of Alternative Medicine 
 The primary precept of alternative medicine is simple and straight: bring respite and balance to the body, mind, and soul to be able to promote wellness. This idea of balance is as old as this holistic methodology itself. Another significant tenet of alternative medicine speaks out the idea that each individual belongs to separate arena when it comes to physical merits and demerits, and therefore, a strategy which is personally tailored must be developed for each individual (to help them attaining optimal wellness). To mention here, there are many domains of alternative medicine available for study: 
 1. Acupuncture 
 An acupuncturist uses small needles at particular points on one's body to take away the stress and relieve all the pain and illness. The theory of acupuncture came into existence in China and is one of the earliest forms of medicine. This exercise is helpful against pain, infertility, heart related diseases, migraine, digestive ailments, and more. 
 2. Massage Therapy 
 Massage therapy is another in the list of alternative medicine that is becoming more popular and acquiring accolades by more conventional healthcare providers and insurance providers. This therapy is used to cure general pain, stress, injuries, pregnancy related pain, and more such kinds of discomfort. The massage practitioners are going through an increased demand for their services, which showcases the fondness and fame that this therapy is grabbing presently. 
 3. Herbal Medicine 
 To find a substitute to Western drugs and all of the side effects emerging from it, herbal medicine supports more and more use of herbs that work together on the body to recover the poise and wellness. Herbalists can also pursue careers in retail, agriculture or consulting. 
 4. Chiropractor 
 Chiropractors are nothing less than alternative medicine practitioners. They do not attend "traditional" medical schools; however, chiropractors accomplish a doctorate degree in chiropractic, from a chiropractic school. They offer remedies for issues of the bones and joints. Most commonly, they treat neck and spinal pain, but many chiropractors cure a wide range of other conditions, too, such as headache. 
 5. Homeopathic Medicine 
 As we believe, homeopathy follows the thumb rule of "like cures like." Homeopathic remedies, which are specifically small vials of small white pellets, are usually made from plant, animal or mineral ingredients. The original extract is watered down many times using a method called potentization until there appear a few traces of the unique substance in the remedy. 
 6. Music Therapy 
 Music therapy! Sounds interesting, doesn't it? As the name itself can clarify as to why, this therapy is rapidly getting approval in the traditional medical care world. Healthcare institutions are able to identify the importance and benefits of music therapy. Therefore, music therapy will keep on earning accolades as it is being increasingly recommended by the providers. It has also started taking its place in the treatment strategy for an array of health problems. 
 Certification And Licensure 
 After obtaining a master's degree in alternative medicine, students are licensed by their resident State before they start practicing legally. Licensing requirements are different from state to state. In addition, there are also a couple of states not as of yet offering license in alternative medicine. In order to be accepted as an efficient practitioner in alternative medicine, licensure is quintessential. Some Institutes or medicine schools offer licensing as part of the educational procedure, making it much accessible for students to take a transition from an educational environment to a professional one. When selecting the best degree program from all the  demanding alternative medicine courses and training , find out if they offer licensure, and then apply.
