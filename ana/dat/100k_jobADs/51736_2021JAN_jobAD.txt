 What is Easy Cash Job? 
 Easy Cash Job(ECJ) is a website that claims to let you make money by either sharing the referral link or work on some simple tasks for them. 
 It is similar to many programs that I have reviewed before. These sites are generally called get paid to(GPT) sites. Because essentially you are paid to complete certain tasks for them. 
 For example, you could be asked to fill up surveys, data entry or testing mobile app. 
 This is a legit way to make money online. In fact, companies like  InboxDollars and Swaybucks  have been doing this for years. 
 The official website easycashjob.com was launched in April 2019. 
 So it is a relatively new company as of writing this review. Now, let‚Äôs see how to make money with them. 
 How to Join Easy Cash Job? 
 You need to provide information like your name, email, birthday, gender and password in order to register for an account. 
 The process is actually quite simple and after that you will get access to the member area. 
 Then, you will share your referral link to make money. You can earn $1 for each referral registered through your link. 
 Other than that, you can also complete tasks that are within the member area. Some tasks earn you $5, some earn $10. 
 The time it takes to complete those tasks also vary based on how pricey it is. Generally the more time consuming task is going to earn you more money. 
 How Does Easy Cash Job Really Work? 
 This is the part where it is going to get real and ugly. After reviewing more than 100 online programs, I have seen more than 10 programs that operate very similarly with ECJ. 
 Most of these websites do not pay their members. They either pay you in terms of stock or they straight up ban your account when you tries to withdraw the money. 
 You might wonder why would someone do something this lame. It is because they can have you done the survey for them for free. 
 Then they can sell these surveys to real company like  InboxDollars and Swaybucks . 
 The worst part is that there are rumors saying that they might even steal your credential and try to break into your bank account. 
 Remember you used an email and password to sign up for an account. 
 Please be extra careful here and don‚Äôt use any email that‚Äôs associated with your bank information. 
 What Do I like about Easy Cash Job? 
 1. Legit Business Model 
 Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the business model ECJ used is totally legitimate and it‚Äôs proven to let people make money. 
 But I doubt if you can get money from ECJ. Paid survey is a real thing for companies like  InboxDollars and Swaybucks  because they have thousands of users who actually got the money. 
 
 What Don't I like about Easy Cash Job? 
 1. Hidden Information 
 A legit company will disclose information like who is the company founder and where‚Äôs the company located at. 
 But sadly you can‚Äôt find anything on ECJ website. They seem to hide everything from the users and the customer service took forever to respond. 
 This is a big red flag because communication is the key for an online program to be successful. 
 2. Very similar to other scams 
 The structure of their website is too similar to many scams that I have exposed in the past. 
 It‚Äôs so close that I already knew this was not something great when I took a glance at its homepage. 
 They use a similar promotion badge and introduce similar method of letting people make money. 
 3. Not Passive Income 
 Even if you really got paid here in ECJ, I doubt if the time is worth it. When I am looking for a way to make money online, I prefer to use the time to build a passive income for me. 
 For example, instead of spending my time doing paid survey, I rather spend time writing blogs and reviews so that I get more visitors to my website and make more affiliate commission. 
 This is exactly how I make an extra income each month. The best thing is my website works 24/7 for me. 
 In other words, I can earn money even while I am asleep because my website is accessible worldwide. 
 There are people from different time zone will get to my site through Google. 
 Who Is Easy Cash Job for? 
 Easy Cash Job is for nobody because you can‚Äôt really make money here. You are exposed to the risk of phishing scam instead. 
 Therefore if you are really into paid survey, I recommend you check out the other programs I have mentioned above. Because those are the big major firms that have good reputation online. You are less likely to get scammed by them. 
 Is Easy Cash Job A Scam? 
 I think it is pretty obvious at this point whether if Easy Cash Job is a scam. Overall, I think you should not waste your time here.

 You need to learn the skills like search engine optimization(SEO), getting free organic traffic, monetizing your website in order to make passive income online. 
 Lastly, I wish you the best if you are working hard to increase your income. Please feel free to leave a comment if you have any question or concern. I am happy to help!
