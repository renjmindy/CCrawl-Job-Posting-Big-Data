 You'll be responsible for building and running the transactions engine that underpins our products 
 Role overview 
 What you will do... 
 As a Software Engineer in the Gaming Transactions squad you will be responsible for building and running the transactions engine which underpins our customer facing products. This is a new and rapidly evolving service which is a key enabler for our platform strategy. 
 You'll be leading the way with the latest technologies including: 
 
 Go  for our API backends 
 MySQL  and  Kafka  for data storage and transport 
 Docker  to containerise them 
 Jenkins  to build them 
 Kubernetes  to host them 
 Grafana  and  Prometheus  to monitor them 
 
 Itâ€™s quite OK if some of the above is new to you, so long as you have an appetite and energy for imparting what you know, and learning what you donâ€™t. 
 How you will do itâ€¦ 
 Reporting into the Lead Software Engineer, you will: 
 
 Turn concepts and requirements into highly available web applications and systems using industry standard languages and technologies such as Go, Kafka, Docker, Prometheus, AWS, Kubernetes, and Terraform. 
 Espouse the merits of idiomatic Go with a real passion for the language. 
 Actively participate in application and database design, data flows and detailed technical design. Ensure that analysis includes the wider view of technical and business impact. 
 Take ownership for code quality, security and scalability and have an equal grasp of the overall system you are working on and how it meets the needs of the end users, and business objectives. 
 Balance the commercial needs of the business against the ideal technical design, proposing sound phased or tactical implementations where appropriate. 
 Understand the importance of non-functionals such as real-time monitoring, good alert design and great logging strategies. Ensuring systems perform well to deliver the best user experience possible is something you consider as part of the normal delivery process. 
 Collaborate with other team members; learning from them, and in turn working with them to help them improve their own skills too. 
 Support the implementation of continuous integration to enhance deployment processes. 
 
 We are using virtual hiring and remote on-boarding to help our candidates and hiring managers stay safe. Face to face interactions will move over to video for this vacancy.
