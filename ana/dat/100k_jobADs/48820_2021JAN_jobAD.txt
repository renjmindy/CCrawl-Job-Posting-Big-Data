 Yes, Workable-hosted careers pages are optimized for both desktop and mobile. Share links to your open jobs via email or social media and candidates will be able to easily apply via mobile. 
 If you've built your own careers page completely  custom through Workable's API , mobile usability will depend on your site, however, when candidates apply for a job it will always be mobile friendly.
