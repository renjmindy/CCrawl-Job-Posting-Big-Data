 Effective Techniques to Deal with Difficult Customers: Resolve Complaints and Gain Customer Satisfaction 
 February 20, 2020   Trainhr Training 
 How to communicate effectively…well, this is a billion dollar question in the minds of most people for whom communication is part of their professional or personal existence. A gifted communicator is not necessarily the most effective one, and vice versa. Being articulate and stylish in one’s communication can help to make an impact to an extent. 
 However, it is the effective communicator whose impact lasts, because the effective communicator communicates what needs to be communicated, in the right measure, and with the accurate and exact choice of words. This communication may not be grandiloquent, may not consist of the most elegant words, or may not be the most attractive one, too. 
 The test of communication is in how effective it is, rather than how stylish it is. David Rohlander, author of the bestselling book,  CEO Code  , will, at a webinar that TrainHR, a leading provider of professional training for the human resources areas, is organizing on March 25, explain all the core aspects of effective communication. 
 To get a thorough understanding of how to cultivate effective communication, please register for this webinar by visiting  TrainHR . 
 
 At this webinar, David will help participants to understand how to use communication to deal with all kinds of people that we meet during the course of everyday life. He will explain how it is a great tool to deal with difficult people, especially when in sales and marketing. Participants of this webinar will learn how to be effective in communicating so that it brings a smile on their client’s face and make every customer happy. 
 David will traverse the road from the broad philosophy of effective communication to how to drill it down to activities in our daily lives to emerge successful as a communicator. 
 He will help the participants explore the five core elements of effective communication, namely trust, respect, understanding, empathy and resolution, out of all of which, the quality of understanding takes the prime position. 
 During the course of this webinar, David will cover the following areas: 
 
 What is Effective Communication? 
 Trust 
 Respect 
 Understanding 
 Empathy 
 Resolution 
 It is an art 
 Personal Agendas 
 Dealing with Difficult Customers and Clients 
 Understanding each Individuals Goals and Fears 
 Learning Specific Techniques to use with others, the Good, Bad and Ugly

 It is now well-known that the workforce of the future will be dominated by the Millennials. This generation, the first to grow up with the technological gadgets that we have come to depend on, adapts these technologies with far greater ease than the previous generations, and come with their own characteristics. 
 Since the workplace is going to be filled up by those of this generation, it helps organizations to learn how to make the best use of the talents and abilities the Millennials bring. This can be both a challenge and an opportunity for organizations’ HR. 
 Organizations should build the image of being millennial-friendly and brand themselves accordingly. The aim should be to create an organization that the Millennials like to work in. Organizations should understand what the Millennials prefer and how they like to learn and develop themselves.

 Transition from Peer to Supervisor 
 July 26, 2019July 26, 2019   Trainhr Training 
 A promotion may be the reward for an employee’s dedication, hard work, passion and discipline or much else. However, while it instils a feeling of great positivity in the employee who gets promoted, the same cannot be said about the colleagues she supersedes in getting promoted! The envy, the unease and the cantankerous feeling that a promotion could arouse in the rest of the team is not the best of feelings to encounter. 
 Yet, if the promoted colleague has to work with those same colleagues, it calls for adapting an altogether different outlook. The promoted employee has to motivate these jealous teammates and take them along, a challenge by any stretch of imagination. 
 How does the newly promoted employee do this? How does she ensure that every one of the uncomfortable team members is in the boat with her? This is the crucial learning a sixty-minute webinar from TrainHR, a leading provider of professional training for all the areas of human resources, is going to teach.

 The critical role communication plays in preventing and resolving many of the issues arising in managing a team which the supervisor was a part of, will be explained at this webinar. The ways in which boundaries need to be set, the ways by which to make communication effective, the manner in which to build trust and respect, and choosing the right manner in which positive feedback can be offered to peers and colleagues, are some of the topics that the expert will take up at this session. Tonia will help the newly promoted supervisors understand the ways by which to overcome their most pressing issues.

 Attracting, Growing and Retaining Millennials 
 June 4, 2019   Trainhr Training 
 The Millennials are the latest generation at the American workforce, which is now home to an amazing five different generations. The Millennials, born roughly in the early 1980’s and reaching their early adulthood in the early 2000’s, are unique in one sense: they are born and are growing almost conterminously with the explosion in the present-day technologies and all their attendant spinoffs, such as the social media. 
 As they are set to make up the largest chunk of the American workforce in the very immediate future, it is necessary for organizations to understand how to harness their talents and energies for the better of the organization. HR has to understand their qualities and characteristics and has to create a Millennials-friendly workplace that enhances their skills and abilities. 
 How do organizations do this? What are the ways by which they brand their organizations as ones that are amiable to the Millennials?

 Strategic Thinking Is More Than the Big Picture 
 May 23, 2019   Trainhr Training 
 We all know the importance of strategic thinking. This is the thinking that will grow organizations into leaders in their industry or spheres. Many managers are busy with far too many daily routines and activities that consume most of their time and allow little time to concentrate on the strategic. 
 Tasks are no doubt important, but one should not get bogged down too much into them to lose sight of the big picture. Losing sight of the strategic results in total breakdown for the organization, which will just be doing things routinely without growing. The challenge for managers and leaders is to balance the tactical with the strategic. 
 Visualizing the strategic goal and then determining how to get there is what leadership is expected to do. A leader who wants to get to the next level and also take the organization there has to be strategic in her thinking. She has to bring in a strategic perspective. 
 What is this strategic perspective? It combines business insight with knowledge of the industry. It makes use of competitive information. It goes beyond bringing in a global perspective, and combines strategic skillsets with the tactical. 
 So, how does a leader inculcate strategic thinking? This will be taught at a webinar that TrainHR, a leading provider of professional training for the human resources arenas, will be organizing on June 13. Valerie Pelan, President of Integrated Focus, will be the expert at this webinar. 
 Please register for this sixty-minute webinar by visiting  http://bit.ly/2WsLVAF . 
 
 This webinar is aimed at benefiting personnel such as Leaders, Managers, Individual Contributors, High Potentials, and Baby Boomers, i.e., anyone who is already performing a strategic role or will be called upon to do so. 
 Valerie will cover the following areas at this webinar: 
 
 Definition of strategic - but it is more than a simple definition 
 Its more than global perspective 
 It includes Business Acumen 
 Industry and competitive analysis - understand your company's industry and competitors 
 Distinguish between the short term and long-term company financials 
 Tools include: SWOT analysis and Blue Ocean Strategy 
 Compare leadership skills with manager skills 
 Leader focuses on big picture while the manager focuses on tactical actions.

 Attracting, Growing and Retaining Millennials 
 May 6, 2019   Trainhr Training 
 The generational spread that characterizes the American workforce today is unprecedented: it consists of no fewer than five generations. Quite naturally, the latest entrant into this workforce, the Millennials, will be the dominant group as the others start to phase out. They are set to constitute almost three fourths of the total workforce by 2025, an estimate made out by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 Hiring, retaining and getting the best out of the Millennials is a challenge that organizations face now. New generations have been entering the workforce from the beginning, but the Millennials are the first generation that was born contemporaneously with the onset of new technologies such as the internet and the many spinoffs it has brought in its wake, such as the social media, online learning and many more. 
 The Millennials are characterized by impulsiveness and a lack of attention, and a flair for the visual medium. These, plus other factors that mark them out, need to be factored in when inducting them into the workforce. This makes learning of the ways to handle them an imperative for organizations. If they have to derive the best that the Millennials offer, organizations’ HR has to learn how to optimize the organization’s resources by leveraging the unique strengths that the Millennials bring into the workforce. 
 The ways by which they can do this will be the learning a webinar that is being organized by TrainHR, a leading provider of professional training for the human resources areas, on May 15. The speaker of this sixty-minute session is Lynn Ware, CEO and President, Integral Talent Systems, Inc. 
 Kindly visit  http://bit.ly/2JjESDl  to enroll for this webinar. This webinar has been approved for 1 HR (General) recertification credit hours toward aPHR, PHR, PHRca, SPHR, GPHR, PHRi and SPHRi recertification through HR Certification Institute (HRCI). 
 
 The core of the learning taught at this webinar is the ways by which organizations can brand themselves as being Millennial-friendly. Dr. Ware will show the preferred ways in which Millennials like to learn and develop themselves (Millennial learning preferences). She will help participants discover the components of an integrated career development strategy for Millennials at their organization. She will help them identify leadership practices that are effective in engaging and retaining millennial talent. 
 Since this generation is closely associated with technology, an organization that wants to hire millennials needs to pitch itself as one that appeals to this generation by showcasing the technological innovations it adapts. Dr. Ware will explain the findings of research that has tried to understand what Millennials look for in their employee work experience. This is going to be a highly practical and interactive session in which participants will learn how to manage their recruiting process to attract millennial applicants over the competition, how to develop them and to retain them longer than average. 
 Dr. Ware will cover the following areas at this session: 
 
 Share research findings on what attracts and retains Millennial compared to other generations 
 Explore employment policies such as flexible work schedules 
 Build a Millennial sticky employment brand for your organization

 Transition from Peer to Supervisor 
 March 13, 2019   Trainhr Training 
 Gaining promotion and ascending the ranks in the organization is a great feeling. It doesn’t happen to everyone easily. Many have to toil for it and earn it. While this is a well-deserved promotion, it brings with it a dilemma for the newly-promoted employee: how to deal with peers, the very colleagues who she would have superseded to phase into the new position. 
 This can be tricky at times because of various reasons. When an employee gets promoted, it is not always going to be a pleasant feeling for many or all of her colleagues. Competition, lack of cooperation, jealousy, backbiting and all such negative traits can come to the fore when the colleagues are not comfortable with the rise of one of their own, to whom they would have to report in the future. 
 The challenge is to maintain cordiality and avoid and prevent bad blood among the team members. The newly promoted employee needs to motivate the team and manage it effectively if it has to be a high performance team. How does she ensure that the team members are going to perform well when they are waiting for an opportunity to bring the new supervisor down? 
 The ways of doing this is the learning a webinar from TrainHR, a leading provider of professional training for all the areas of human resources, will impart. At this session, Tonia Morris, Founder of Simply HR, LLC a consultant and management firm, will be the speaker. Please register for this webinar by visiting  http://bit.ly/2FbiGZD  . 
 At this 60-minute session, Tonia will emphasize the importance of communication in preventing and resolving many of the issues concerning how to manage a team of which the new supervisor was a part till the promotion. She will show how to set boundaries, how to communicate effectively, how to build trust and respect, and how to provide positive feedback to peers and colleagues. She will show how to overcome the most pressing challenges newly promoted supervisors face. 
 This webinar, from which personnel in positions such as Managers, Supervisors, Leaders, Human Resource Professional and Shift Leaders or Team will benefit immensely, will cover the following areas: 
 
 How to Communicate more Effectively as a Supervisor 
 When to be Flexible and when to Stand Firm 
 Steps to Build Trust and Gain Respect 
 How to Develop your Own Personal Management Style 
 How to Set Boundaries with Coworkers/Peers 
 How to Deal with Uncomfortable Situations

 The Millennial Workforce: How Smart Companies Engage and Tap Their Entrepreneurial Energy 
 March 12, 2019March 12, 2019   Trainhr Training 
 In this present scenario at the American workforce, where, as the Deloitte Millennial Survey, released in January 2014 shows, Millennials will make up nearly half the workforce by next year; there is a pressing need for employers to devise the right strategies to hire, retain and optimize this major chunk. 
 A few facts about the Millennials are well known. For instance, being the first generation to be almost contemporaneously born with the new technologies that are influencing our world; they are prone to very short attention spans and are more likely to rely on the visual medium to grasps concepts better. These apart, what is also striking about them is the fact that they hate working in a bureaucratic environment and love to be independent at work. 
 Being highfliers, they don’t like to be confined to the workplace for long. They love to be enterprising and will move to more rewarding opportunities much faster than the previous generations did. The criteria they usually consider for higher rewards include autonomy, freedom to be creative, and the opportunity for making an impact. 
 This makes it imperative for managers of the present-day organizations to create the right environment for this segment of the workforce if they have to leverage their skills and knowledge. The aim of doing this is obvious: to be in a position to better marshal their talent to make them more productive for the organization. 
 Thorough learning of how to handle the Millennials at the workplace 
 It is this knowledge that will be the core of a learning session that TrainHR, a leading provider of professional training for the human resources areas, is offering at a webinar.

 Define engagement and identify the three types of employees 
 Recognize the myths and the realities of the millennial workforce 
 Discover why millennials are great candidates for intrapreneurship 
 Review examples of intrapreneurship in large, medium and small size companies 
 Recognize the type of culture that encourages innovation and intrapreneurship 
 Discover why the manager is the key for employee engagement, innovation and retention 
 Review five management techniques that will lead to better communication and results with Millennials.
