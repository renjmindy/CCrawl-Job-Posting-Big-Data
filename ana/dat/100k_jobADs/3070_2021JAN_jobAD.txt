 Who are Kelsey's family? 
 Kelsey has a very tight knit family. The star suffered a terrible tragedy when her younger brother passed away back in 2013 from spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). 
 The disease can take away people strength, as well as their ability to walk, eat, and even breathe in the worst case scenario.

 Last month Kelsey shared the devastating news that her younger sister Kennedy, eight, who also has SMA, had been rushed to hospital after contracting coronavirus. 
 Posting to Instagram the star wrote: "Life is so cruel. My little sister kennedy got rushed into hospital yesterday and tested positive for COVID19, we are all so heartbroken as kennedy has severe breathing problems from her terminal illness SMA as it is.” 
 However two weeks later she shared  her joy that Kennedy had been released from hospital.

 The TOWIE star said: “She’s coming home from hospital today!!! Believe i cried happy tears all morning she’s the best xxxxx”. 
 What does Kelsey like most about being on TOWIE? 
 Kelsey told Bobby, in an interview with  OK!  , that she likes being on the show as she is able to campaign for awareness for sister’s illness. 
 The 20 year old said: “I got to speak about my little sister’s illness – she has spinal muscular atrophy, which means she’s paralysed from the neck down – and I’ve loved speaking about that.

 TOWIE stars: Past and present 
 “We’re doing a charity fundraising day on TOWIE. I’ve always wanted to do something like that.” 
 She then added: “I’ve had hundreds of messages, loads from families going through the same thing. And everyone’s just saying they’re proud of me. 
 “It was hard because I don’t really like speaking about it as I get upset, but I’m glad I did it.”
