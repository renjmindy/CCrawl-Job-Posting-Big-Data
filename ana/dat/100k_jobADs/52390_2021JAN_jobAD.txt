 Hiring: A Partner for our Family Ministry Team 
 Job Description (and feel free to share this post!) 
 You may or may not have been reading this blog when I posted this: 
 http://westcoastcm.com/2010/05/17/top-10-reasons-i-want-you-on-staff/ 
 Context: You see, a good friend of mine had left our family ministry team and I knew that only the right person could fill the gap left in our ministry team. Our church was in the midst of restructuring in such a way that we could strategically partner with parents of kids, cradle to college, to pass the faith on to the next generation. 
 And, because Jesus knows what he's up to, we hired the only person who could have filled the position we created. 
 Now, a few years later, we are looking to add another person to our team. 
 Earlier this year, our Middle School Director got married. That life-transition led him to begin interviewing at churches so that he and his new wife could take on a bigger role at a place that was looking at doing some of the same creative things in ministry that we've been doing to reach families in our community. Hard to blame him - 7 years ago, I did the same thing. I'm stoked (and a little sad) to say that he found an amazing fit out in Colorado, where he'll be able to help lead that church in a direction that's a little more  Orange  than it's been. 
 Soâ€¦ we're hiring. 
 The job description is here: 
 http://www.glenkirkchurch.org/page3-52/ResourcesJobopportunities 
 We only hire people who are passionate about partnering with families, who are innovative in ministry and have a track record of building teams who pass the faith on well to the next generation. 
 If that's you (or you know someone who fits that description), let me know. You can send me a message on Facebook ( HERE ) or Twitter ( HERE ) or leave a comment below and I'll put in a good word for you ðŸ™‚
