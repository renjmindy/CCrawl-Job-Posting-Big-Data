 What is the Living Income Guaranteed? 
 Posted on  October 11, 2013  Updated on  February 20, 2014 
 Living Income Guaranteed  is an economic and political mechanism to ensure the establishment of Fundamental Human Birth Rights of the public through allocating an allowance on a monthly basis to every eligible individual that is currently in a position of being unable to sustain themselves – and/or people in their custody – financially to a level that Human Dignity deserves and that currently lack such support due to reasons beyond their immediate control including – but not limited to – unemployment, lacking access to food, lacking access to housing, lacking access to healthcare, lacking access to education, physical disability, being retired or not old enough to have a job. 
 This is within the understanding that the existence of poverty and lack of education as the key to have a job and means to live is the result and outflow of the economic system’s malfunction, providing an unfair allocation of National Natural Resources, being unable to support every living individual with sufficient access to fundamental living necessities. The most immediate remedy is to eradicate poverty, through allocating/designating a monthly allowance to those that don’t have access to their fundamental living necessities, thereby empowering them to establish a dignified life, enabling each one to reach their potential, choose a career and contribute to the economy through their skill, labour and purchasing power. 
 
 Why is it called Living Income instead of Basic Income? 
 It is called ‘Living Income’ because it won’t only provide each one with the minimum required to survive, it implies sufficient allowance that is able to cover the fundamental expenses required for a dignified living  ~~~~–  Why? Because this will enable people to reach their creative potential, return to the job market, become independent from the Living Income and contribute to the progression of the economy. 
 This means that a  Living Income Guaranteed  should be provided to all individuals that are currently unable to participate in any economic activity due to the lack of jobs/education/health. However those that don’t participate in any economic activity but do have sufficient money to live due to, for example, family wealth, inheritance or any other regular income won’t qualify nor require the Living Income Guaranteed. 
 Why is Living Income Guaranteed Not Unconditional? 
 The reason why it is not given to all people unconditionally is because this would undermine the sustainability of an economic system that does require people to be motivated to educate themselves and work to enable the continuation and functionality of our societies. 
 That means that people that work won’t get the Living Income Guaranteed? 
 That’s right, however we Do propose that the  Minimum Wage is Doubled  (twice the Living Income Allowance), which means that there will be a series of reforms to take place first to make the Living Income Guaranteed a sufficient Allowance granted to cover fundamental living necessities, which is within the context of our current economy More than our current Minimum Wage standards. 
 This allowance should be sufficient for an individual to have dignified living condition  s  with guaranteed access to their fundamental human birth rights: Food, Water, Housing, Healthcare, Education, Clothing, Transportation, Public Services, etc. 
 Now to motivate people to work, the new minimum wage should be Double the Living Income Guaranteed in the most common economic activities which are at the moment associated with retail workers, waiters, cashiers, transportation workers, fast food industries, etc.. 
 So, anyone that genuinely wants to have a top quality lifestyle will not conform to only getting the minimum as the Living Income, but continue educating themselves, developing further skills to make more money and have more financial solvency. 
 
 What’s in it for the corporations with implementing the Living Income Guaranteed model? 
 A broader consumer base . Those that previously had no money to live and as such were not economically active will suddenly become active participants in the economy which will ensure that profit is also broadened for corporations, realizing that if more buyers emerge, there will be more profit that can be used to better the working conditions, to diminish the compulsive production and instead  adapt the prices to make things affordable , with great quality and providing a secure and harmonious working base, as well as proceeding to fund the automation of jobs that are currently deteriorating human health. 
 Workers will feel supported and cared for by their employers, which will result in individuals that no longer feel pressured and enforced to only be a  profit-making machine , but will feel happy and content to realize that their work is being truly remunerated and that their time and contribution to the corporation is being valued as the life-time investment it actually is. A  well remunerated individual will create a happier and fulfilled society  that is no longer afraid of not having sufficient money to feed their family, it will be the beginning of a new era of quality work that dignifies the lives of human beings that genuinely desire to improve their lifestyles. 
 
 
 
 Why is the implementation of a Living Income Guaranteed an immediate solution to the economic crisis? 
 More than a solution to a crisis, it should be understood as the  way to guarantee that the Fundamental Human Rights  to each individual are properly funded through allocating an Allowance as the access to the necessary things one requires to live in a dignified way – this is within the principle of Giving to others what we would like to receive, and if we want to live in a peaceful society, to have a happy and healthy living condition, we then must give access to this Allowance/Income as a living certainty that will eradicate the need to resort to crime, panhandling, homelessness, lacking education, health care that results in economical regression affecting every individual in society. 
 It is common sense that if we give an Allowance to every eligible individual to be well nourished, have proper living conditions with the fundamental necessary services, health care and leisure time, more educated beings will emerge from this when realizing that if one is given support as in getting an income to cover one’s living necessities, one learns how to give back to society too. This will be understood as a living principle that applies to every living being on Earth beyond any political, social, religious or ideological affiliation. We’re talking about physical living necessities that all human beings require to live in a dignified and sustainable way. 
 On top of this, many jobs are being replaced by  the rise of the machine , which will require more restructuring processes in our economy to finally upgrade the premise of being able to ‘make a living by having a job’ because if jobs are currently not available to all – regardless of having college degrees and necessary skills to have one – then it is certain that a new understanding of our economy should be grasped as supportive mechanism for all individuals rather than a restrictive and coercive one. 
 In the past, long-term policies and treaties have attempted to benefit the working class over time, and it has proven to be inefficient for the tightening policies implemented by corporations as well as the economic outflows have deviated their effectiveness. This is how through a direct intervention to provide the Living Income as an Allowance and doubling of the minimum wage, we are directing the problem at the root, instead of expecting third party actors and policies to solve the situation throughout time. 
 Will the Living Income Guaranteed undermine competition and as such create economic stagnation in society? 
 Not at all, actually it’s the other way around.  If we define  competition  as the ability achieve the best living condition in a society, by allocating Allowance to every eligible individual that previously had no access to it, we assure the activation of the economy and impulse people to  work if they do want to have a greater economic solvency  to cover other consumer desires for extra commodities that are not able to be paid for with the Living Income Guaranteed. Also, there is no limit to how much money you or corporations can make as long as their businesses do not interfere in any way with the nationalization of natural resources or fundamental public services – that is the condition. That means that the rules of a free market still apply and as such, the only constitutional and governmental management will be to supervise the implementation of the Living Income Guaranteed, as well as conducting the usual maintenance, management and provision of public goods and the justice department. 
 The more you prepare yourself, the better work you’ll have, the more benefits which means you will earn more money as well. Competition means bettering oneself to perform a certain activity the best way one can and this is an essential part of  human nature  that has kept our societies remaining competitive, innovative and creative at a local and global level. 
 You will also be able to truly have free choice on which work is best for you instead of engaging in working contracts based on need rather than preference or choice. This is the way to implement a real ethical environment at work too, where no more exploitation occurs since any job won’t be the result of a need to work in order to survive, but rather become a means and incentive to increase the quality of life. 
 How will it be funded? 
 Through the  nationalization of resources  , banks and basic services which means that if, for example, your  oil , gas, water, electricity, telecommunications ,transportation is defined as patrimony of the people, the profit that comes from the consumption/purchase of such goods and services should be sufficient to fund the Living Income Guaranteed for eligible individuals. This means there will be no need to have personal  taxation  but instead keep the VAT (Value Added Tax) as it is to continue funding the functions of the government – this is also within the consideration that as the purchasing power increases and consumer base broadens, the funds coming from VAT will also increase creating more solvency in governmental budget as well, which translates to higher quality public welfare. 
 Thus with the Living Income Guaranteed there is one thing that is of vital importance: no one in the system, no citizen will pay tax – all tax will be facilitated by either value added tax or sales tax or import duties. If you have a government system that is responsible because you have a system where each one is functioning effectively within the system, you do not need excessive tax; your tax is spent on things like roadwork, transport facilitation – all things that can be handled ‘in house’. 
 One of the things that can work quite effectively also in a country is to have a toll tax on the roads which are managed by the government and that keeps the roads in place, so according to the use that one has of a road = will be the amount of tax you pay, but there will be in this proposal no income tax, so nobody is going to pay for anyone’s Living Income Guaranteed, it’s coming from the resource companies which everybody in the country are participating in and your sales tax or your value added tax will be according to the amount of your participation within a particular system – this is a fair way of dealing with government tax collection. 
 This is how the distribution of wealth and profits is expanded onto those that would have no benefit from the commercialization of natural resources and basic services, and due to the constant consumption and requirement of these, it is ensured that the foundation of the Living Income Guaranteed will always remain sustainable and have sufficient funds to cover the beneficiaries’ expenses. 
 Another example is how through stopping allocating money to fund wars, the trillions of dollars that are spent in the warfare industry can be designated to revitalize the economy through funding the Living Income Guaranteed and supporting the health care, education, commerce, production industries and basic services that require to be improved at home. 
 Will Public Services also be Nationalized? 
 Health care, education, water, electricity, telecommunications,  media ,  banks will also be nationalized . Each country will have to assess their available resources in order for the government to make sufficient profit to fund the Living Income Guaranteed. 
 How can we implement the Living Income Guaranteed? 
 Through a political proposal, through existing or new political parties that have this mechanism as their key card to gain the majority vote to have our Fundamental  Human Rights  guaranteed through the Living Income Guaranteed. This means that the right to a Living Income must be granted on a constitutional basis – this is a national-based system constituted at a political level and able to be voted on within a democratic process based on the principle of one man, one vote.

 Living Income Guaranteed and the Rise of the Machine 
 Posted on  September 2, 2013  Updated on  October 31, 2013 
 This will be an ongoing discussion wherein slowly but surely we will dissect the situation around the idea that the machine could be ‘the savior of mankind.’ 
 Within this we have to first look at where we are with the machine as it exists now: 
 
 What is this machine? 
 What have we done with this machine? 
 How is this machine functioning in our current society? 
 
 Here let me give you a story… 
 About three years ago, one of the neighbors came and we were discussing things in general, he then mentioned an interesting event, a family member tendered for the engine block of one of the new Toyota models that were going to be produced. The specifications of the tender were that the block must last for a warranty period of five years. So in their diligence and commitment to get the tender, they engineered an engine block that would last 8 years. Obviously they were under the impression that if you produce something better than the specifications, your tender will probably receive a more positive view. Fascinatingly enough their tender was rejected, because it did not keep to the specification of a warranty of 5 years. 
 Now the engine block of a motorcar is engineered, produced and constructed by the machine, but who makes the machine that makes the engine block? That is the human and the human intent. 
If we take this now to a broader view of many, many products that are available in stores, we’ll notice that many of them are produced by the machine. But regardless of being produced by the machine (which by the way ensures a greater level of perfection than when it is produced by the human) – in total disregard of this potential perfection, the human would design the machine to produce the goods to only last a limited period of time. This causes massive levels of consumption, placing massive pressure on resources and all in the name of creating a market flow which produces money and profit, which produces – according to our well-drilled brainwashed economists –a market economy that’s necessary to keep the world economy going. 
 And within this obviously, the competition that exists between the remaining few corporations in this game of monopoly, is to see ‘who can destroy who’ in price wars. It’s an economic war going on and at the end ‘only one shall remain’ – and the one that remains obviously will determine in the end the quality of the product produced. If the consumer has already been conditioned by the fact that nothing else is available but that which has a limited warranty, the corporation can keep producing the same product over and over again, knowing that it will fail within a particular period of time where the consumer will be addicted and adapted to have the product and thus must replace it by their own apparent ‘free choice’ -- and so a market force is being created. 
 Is this really the purpose of ‘the Rise of the Machine’? 
What is the machine replacing but the human labor point? 
By replacing human labor what we have already seen is that many people lose their jobs and even those that remain employed, end up receiving lower incomes with only the few at the top receiving higher incomes. In this way it is ensured that those that do make the decisions, do not question the system; those that do not make the decisions have no choice, because otherwise they will have no job because of their diminished bargaining power in an economy with high unemployment. 
 So, a perfect slavery system exists – all in the name of the machine and the machine is blamed for it, instead of the human. 
 Certainly in a redesigned economy, the machine can play a significant role in perfecting the products available for the human race to use, perfecting the reduction of resources used in the production process, extending the life of the produced product as part of this perfection. Through this, allowing the human to benefit from their placement of the labor resource by ensuring that there is significant and enough Living income for each one to ensure that the product produced can be consumed but for mostly to ensure that the right to life is recognized as a human right, allowing the human to have more free time in which to develop their awareness to become more benevolent, less competitive and self-responsible. Those are the points which  should be  the outflow of the rise of the machine: a reduction in competition thus a reduction in conflict, a reduction in war and the development of quality production and sustainability, because the principles are understood as what is necessary to have an ecosystem that is effective and supportive in nourishing the human race as a whole. Unfortunately, this is yet to be considered. 
 You should watch the documentary 
 The Light Bulb Conspiracy  to understand the nature of the problem: the problem is the human being, not the machine. The machine certainly can create and contribute to a society that brings vast levels of freedom to everyone and our society can develop a higher purpose for its existence. At the moment, we’re at the most basic part of our existence where there’s not even a Living Income, there’s not even a Living Income for everyone! While this could have been possible if this was introduced as the machine was rising but instead, those brutal enough to take advantage of the situation forced a play that caused a massive problem in the world, and now all the top people, the elite in the world has no idea how to practically solve the problem. 
 So the solution to the problem is not apparent, more radical steps are being considered. I would suggest that the real radical step is to realize that the mistake was made when labor was removed from the equation of the pricing of a product, and it was replaced by the labor of the machine, you cannot compare the two: the machine is actually an extension of human labor and therefore the human should be glorified through it, it found a better way to create more time. But now instead, those that do not fit into the economic model are forced to use all their time to find ways to survive – that is certainly  not  the way forward. 
 Investigate 
  Living Income Guaranteed , become part of the research. If your objective and your principle is like ours: to find a practical solution that is best for all that works for everyone and you can see that obviously that is the only way we will have a workable solution on earth, then join us. There is no way that an answer on Earth is going to come through an individual, it’s going to require a group, the group as humanity to work together, to bury the hatchet and to forgive each other and to move on and create a system that is best for all – there is no other solution possible. And to simply try and ‘find ways’ that do not involve an outcome that is best for all: is just a waste of time.

 Living Income Guaranteed with Labor as Interest 
 Posted on  July 4, 2013  Updated on  February 20, 2014 
 With the nationalization of banks within the Living Income Guaranteed and the eradication of interest on money, the money supply will grow as a function of labor. The labor has a capital value that will increase the money supply. This has been effectively used by the Germans where they made labor one of the foundations of their economic system. And within the Living Income Guaranteed where you have a Living Income for all your basic needs and you have a guaranteed minimum wage that is double the Living Income Guaranteed, your labor value will be predetermined as part of every product and service produced. 
 This means that the input of your labor as value is reflected and revealed within the price of goods and services. This way each person will understand that part of the price is another person’s livelihood, and that as you give = you will receive. Labor then becomes part of the economic value system, part of the production cost – which must be valued sufficiently to be able to support the laborer. 
 Labor is the action of the human with a measurable value which will be like the accumulation of interest and you’ll have a compound interest effect, which will have the effect of an ever expanding economy, ensuring that everyone in the country has sufficient support to have a dignified life. This is a fascinating point that economists should have adopted long ago, but unfortunately labor has been demonized instead of realizing that that is the actual only real interest that can exist within a system based on money.

 Living Income Guarantees Business Profits 
 Posted on  July 4, 2013  Updated on  October 31, 2013 
 For the Living Income Guaranteed to work we require an economic model that must be efficient to follow very specific regulations. Just as one would regulate food and certify it for instance as ‘safe for consumption,’ we have to apply the same principle and certify businesses as ‘safe for the economy’. Within this, one will have to establish ways to ensure that businesses are not built on the ideology of competition but rather on the principle of profit and of quality. 
 Therefore pricing will have to be certified to be sufficient and effective to ensure the minimum wage at least, is paid to the employees, the business owner makes a profit and the resources bought are paid for at a price that ensures such profit. We have to also ensure that the business is compliant and the movement of sales tax/ value added tax is efficient so that both the government and the Living Income Guaranteed is effective; and then the consumer will be able to buy from businesses that ensure a good quality product, knowing that they are participating in an economic system that is taking care of each one’s individual dignified living with Living Income Guaranteed. Doing this will also ensure that things like poverty, debt and the many psychological issues that develop because of stress around money, start to disappear from society. 
 This also implies that the true supply and demand will be based on quality and preference wherein the necessary research should be done and facilitated before one brings out a new product on the market. This is the part where psychology and public relations also play a role to ensure the person assesses the product as something that they possibly may be interested in acquiring; this ensures you’re not wasting resources on a ‘potentially successful’ product, and instead you secure your investment once you have your market analysis results, an effective presentation of a product that will have an assured market with sufficient demand which you will supply – so it is demand first, then supply. 
 Thus a clearly defined and estimated market share is established and cross-referenced according to the income levels available. This means assessing whether the available amount of money that is in the consumer’s budget is in fact realistic so that the business can work effectively. This is how one will ensure profit and sustainability instead of investing on opening businesses that are guaranteed to fail, just because the proper research was not done prior to running it. This effective business planning will ensure that sufficient profit is made as well as providing a good rate of success that will satisfy the business and the population in an equal manner: everybody wins!

 Living Income and Lower Pricing 
 Posted on  July 4, 2013  Updated on  October 31, 2013 
 Economic theory has proven throughout time to be ineffective to manage the resources to ensure that each individual is a beneficiary and effective participant within the sustainability of the world system. We suggest banishing economic theory to the category of conspiracy theory because the evidence of the last few decades shows very clearly that our economists conspire to create greater inequality to destroy the capacity of the economy to provide sufficient jobs within a system that can support the citizens of the world, yet the opposite happens wherein all production is kept in the hands of a few corporations. So far economists have been unable to come up with a solution that will work for the world, while those that benefit from the current applied economic conspiracy theories are becoming astoundingly wealthy and there seems to be no end to this. 
 We also have to look at cognitive disinformation here. Our psychology is also just based on theory that does not properly educate the people on how the mind functions, instead it actually uses the facets of the mind that causes addiction and control – like emotions, feelings and thoughts – to become the accepted ways of human existence, which are then used through advertising, media and Hollywood to condition the human to accept the current conditions on Earth and not question reality. Furthermore our education system and our education theories have reduced the capacity of the human to reason to such an extent that we have a complete dumbed down society with an inability to do basic math or to read and investigate words to understand their actual meaning. Instead, the ideology is created that one must make things sound great without conveying practical solutions and their application. It is a form of complete disassociated information transfer where the consumer system foundation relies on savings and getting products cheaper, because that is competition according to what economic theory suggests. 
 You should take a piece of paper and do some math: if you reduce price which implies that you are reducing the value of labor, you are also reducing income, which is what’s happened now for decades. The real income of the human has decreased, inflation has increased for certain things, some of the basic things have become cheaper and then there’s the enticement about savings. 
 This lower pricing mechanism exists when you have a machine taking over the human labor – which should be based on a capital and advancement of the human capacity and thus should value the human existence more; however, the opposite has happened. With reduced price, reduced income, unemployment increases yet it is recognized as economic efficiency, a capitalistic type of advancement. At the same time we have exchange rates, where certain countries have a high value currency and others a low value currency, which is then used to transfer resources between countries done under the disguise of corporations - which are owned by politicians - creating monopolies that cause extensive poverty. The fact is that this  transfer of resources in theory should benefit all the citizens of a country . 
 Here we can have a look at our early Game Theory that was taught at home through games like Monopoly which has played a major role in becoming part of the accepted theory of how one should live on Earth. Causing the acceptance of just a few major property owners to exist in the world, and their property being not necessarily land or resources, but money – and because they have a lot = apparently the system is working for everyone! Which we all know is not at all so. 
 This lower price ideology has caused major problems such as the theory that ‘Living Income will increase prices’, which is apparently a 'bad thing'. Obviously prices must increase, we have to create more money, we have to show the value of the human, otherwise capitalism cannot work. Human labor is capital and that capital should be increasing because the basic capacity and knowledge of the human race has been increasing and therefore, a greater value should be placed on it. Instead, the value is diminishing and through that, the level of inequality and the amount of people in the world that is living on the breadline (or should we say 'dead-line'?) is increasing and is they have nothing else to do every single day but to spend their total time finding enough to just survive. Being occupied with survival also means that they cannot even challenge the current system, because they don’t have time to educate themselves and engineer solutions that can solve the problem. We also have come to accept that those that are in good positions and have enough resources and time to reason out the problem have seemingly lost the plot and are unable to apply simple basic principles like 1+1=2. 
 If we want to feed the world and we want to use a system like capitalism = we have to create enough money. We can create enough money by valuing the production sufficiently so that within the profit – or the gross profit of the product – there is sufficient money to make sure that everyone that is part of the production – even historically – earns enough money from it. That would increase the potential for everyone’s wealth, and if one does this properly: it’ll reduce inequality. 
 We cannot approach Living Income Guaranteed in this world by using the current accepted economic conspiracy theories or by valuing our current economists. We suggest acquiring basic education on how the world system operates through reading people like  Noam Chomsky , and you’ll see what it means to have critical reasoning and what it means to be able to think for yourself. However understanding and realizing the reality of what he shares is not enough, we have to get involved in the political arena so that the problem we have with our education can be solved. This can be done within the understanding that if we don’t create solutions at a political level through common consent, we will all end up in a position where we have no power – and this is exactly what has happened. The citizen now in the world has got no political power because we have been influenced through the media by information without having the ability to discern between what is actual reality – that would result mathematically in what is best or all – and what is conspiracy theory that is based on creating a ‘feeling’ within us that controls our behavior and our voice, causing us to be and become in essence part of the problem. 
 For a capitalistic system to work and to create enough Living Income for everyone – meaning having enough to survive and to be able to have a basic life on Earth as in having our basic needs fulfilled – there needs to be sufficient money moving that is produced through the accumulated labor and time and input through time. This should have been growing for generations now and the world should have been a place of wealth, but instead seemingly deliberately but possibly astoundingly through a form of deliberate sabotage, instead of creating a growing economy existent as the result of accumulated labor, intelligence and research over time, we have been reducing our capacity to look after the citizens of the world, and continue to justify that in every way possible using theories and opinions instead of dealing with facts. Even our legal system deals with opinions, our psychology deals with opinions, our education deals with opinions, our politics deals with opinions – we don’t hear facts. Our media which should be a journal of reality: deals with opinions, not facts. It actually shapes opinions instead of acting in a way that ensures that this journey on Earth is worthwhile for every human. We do not have journalists with integrity, it is unfortunate – but this will come to an end because the situation is going to escalate exponentially. 
 Only thinking about the solution doesn’t make them tangible and practical in reality and as such, it is part of the problem of why the world’s economic system is collapsing. It’s time to change, time to get some basic education on how we can decide how economy works and give ourselves practical direction so that we can move on to a system where the Living Income of each human is Guaranteed.

 Living Income Guaranteed and Labor Unions 
 Posted on  July 3, 2013  Updated on  October 31, 2013 
 In a democratic system where the citizens elect a management as government to look after their well being and their Human Rights, collective bargaining should not be ever necessary, neither should be the existence of labor unions. Labor is one of the capitals, one of the contributions of a citizen to their country to make it a better place for everyone. The fact that labor unions and collective bargaining is necessary to try and enforce the most basic Human Right as the right to dignity and financial economic stability of a citizen indicates that there is something fundamentally wrong with the system that is currently being accepted. A  Living Income Guaranteed  and a minimum wage are things that should be the basis of study of economics to ensure that the design of the economic system provides for this. Therefore, competition within the creation of products and basic necessities should be based on quality and effective support and not on driving down prices lower to create more unemployment and to destroy Fundamental Human Rights. 
 Labor unions should study the Living Income proposal and use their collective bargaining power to start working towards an economic solution that is effective for all the citizens in the country. Leaders that do not stand and deliver the basic necessities for all citizens and that do not protect the rights of the citizens as humans should not be elected that – this is the benefit we have with democracy. Democracy should not be a mockery as it is now; it should be the tool with which we ensure that our representation is in fact representing our Living Human Rights, not only yours individually but all the citizens of a country – that’s patriotism. A patriot will look after all people in the country, not their own pocket only. 
 We expect to have some labor unions that can actually function within the understanding of what is best for all citizens in a country to ensure that they recognize themselves as a political force that brings about change.

 Living Income Guaranteed and Teaching 
 Posted on  July 3, 2013  Updated on  October 31, 2013 
 This is a more difficult issue because thus far the education systems of the world have only been a drain in the economy and have not really produced anything substantial. One of the latest examples is the South African education system that in the last 10/15 years has eaten up 20% of the budget, but at the university level, there’s only a 15% pass rate with billions being lost in inefficiency. 
 Education and specifically teaching is also a type of ‘easy job’ because there are no real guidelines or minimum standards, while this is one of the points that build the foundation of a society that can exist without a criteria to measure effectiveness, to apply it and to expect effectiveness. 
 The current likelihood of drawing people into the education field is purely for having an ‘easier job,’ one where there is no real accountability and that is quite a problem. Therefore in Living Income Guaranteed we suggest that the teaching profession should be in the category that is normally referred to as one’s vocation. This means that teaching should be in the hierarchy of needs at the level where a person has achieved everything they wanted to be and become in this life, thus they are accomplished and ‘feel the calling’ to educate the children of the future. And they decide to do so not because of money, they do it because of the satisfaction it gives and because they have prepared themselves effectively to be the best that they can be. 
 We suggest that the teachers should be the best individuals of our society, the living examples that can share with the younger generations how to walk through the path of life with sufficient skills, sufficient understanding of how the world works while standing as an example of what it means to be a self responsible and integral person in society. Therefore money should not be what drives the teaching vocation, because Living Income Guaranteed would be – in our proposed format –sufficient to make a decent living, which means a teacher should only ever receive the Living Income Guaranteed and not anything more.This would require one to look at teaching from a different perspective and to investigate the reasons why our education system at this stage seems to be a complete failure. 
 What must also be emphasized is the importance of the family in the basic education of a child, realizing that in essence: education begins at home. The tools and the mechanisms with which to do this should be available in every home, and every parent should be educated and supported to understand how to facilitate this so that by the time the child reaches school, they follow an integral technological education curriculum that facilitates the correct functioning and learning of the mind, and the structure of the character within the relationships that produce a society that is best for everyone. This is how we can bring about the intellectual development of the human to be able to facilitate and contribute to society through finding more effective ways for the coexistence and harmony that is necessary between humans & humans, and humans & animals and humans & nature. 
 Another proposal is that if a method can be found to be effective in managing and ensuring that the teachers do produce the children that we can be proud of in our society, such as teachers being subject to performance evaluations and meeting the criteria for effectiveness, then one can revisit this point and possibly pay the teachers at least the minimum wage. However, based on our current evidence, the situation has not improved at all, it has only gone backwards and there is clearly no solution proposed for immediate implementation, and to simply try and ‘motivate the teacher with money’ while the very future of our society is dependent on their effectiveness means such incentive would be in fact counterproductive. 
 Teaching will be stepping stone to create a society that is genuinely driven to support others to become the best self-sufficient interdependent beings in society, rather than being merely competition driven individuals to make the most profit only – we will finally establish living values that will be the essential structure in which the functionality of our coexistence in self responsibility will be based upon.

 Living Income Guaranteed and Property Ownership 
 Posted on  July 3, 2013  Updated on  October 31, 2013 
 Living Income Guaranteed is particularly focused on those situations where a person is not in a position to have sufficient income to be able to participate as an equal within society through spending, purchasing, ensuring the basic needs required for a human to exist. There are conditions where a Living Income Guaranteed is not required meaning that those that have = do not qualify for a Living Income Guaranteed which is destined to ensure that there is enough income available to support those when in trouble, or when society is not yet able to produce sufficient jobs. 
 One of the foundations of capitalism is owning property, but also one of the foundations of capitalism is having a society that is able to consume because they have the means with which to do so, and this is why it is suggested that a balance must be struck. 
 The basic regulation would be that if you have more than one house you’re owning = you do not qualify for a Living Income Guaranteed because you are able – due to your property value – to sustain yourself or at the very least, you’ll have to sell one of the properties and then if you do not have employment, you’ll be able to qualify for a Living Income Guaranteed. 
 Another point is Investments. If you are able to sustain yourself through your investments – that means you have money somewhere in some form = you won’t need such investments any longer, because the Living Income Guaranteed will also act as a pension. Eventually, a mechanism will have to be established to see at which level investment would be sufficient so that you are no longer dependent on the Living Income Guaranteed and you are able to sustain yourself. Therefore savings or investments from the perspective of it creating sufficient wealth for you to sustain yourself will automatically place you in a position where you do not require a Living Income Guaranteed, because you are able to financially sustain yourself. 
 Capital growth is thus one of the points that will be promoted within a Living Income Guaranteed system because it will eventually create a situation where one will be able to be financially self-sustained, and the objective is to get each human to be financially self-sustained so that you are no longer dependent on your social systems – pension plans, insurance, loans, investments – as well as acquiring the skill to use capital in a way that you actually are able to sustain your existence. Then capitalism will become a functional system that benefits everyone with this necessary support when needed and a necessary responsibility when your Living Income Guaranteed is no longer required. This also places one within the self-development mindset that capitalism represents where you specifically acquire skills to eventually free yourself from the needed support, because you have been able to create for yourself a self-support system. Within your hierarchy of needs this would mean that you have achieved a level of self-fulfillment, thus a higher level of living within responsibility. 
 The psychological benefit one can find within capitalism will be worthwhile as it is structured practically within this reality, you do not have the stress that comes if you get to fail in your endeavor and you have nowhere to go, because there will be support. And as we have noticed within capitalism, one tends to fail the first few times because you haven’t got the skills yet and the experience, although that should be developed also within the education system so that failure is limited to the minimum, because failure means resources get wasted and when resources get wasted: it becomes more difficult to have a sustainable balanced system.

 Living Income Guaranteed and Pensions 
 Posted on  July 3, 2013  Updated on  October 31, 2013 
 Within a Living  Income Guaranteed  system the need for unemployment, insurance, benefits, pensions and life insurance no longer exists. The resources that are placed within the shareholding of the citizenry is what facilitates the Living Income Guaranteed and one qualifies for benefit from your shareholding when you are unemployed, when you are on pension or when you are in some way incapacitated and you cannot work – this implies that there is never a stage where one is without the necessary capital to actually sustain a living. 
 The industries that are currently profiting from all the misfortunes in a person’s life no longer need to exist because your Living Income Guaranteed facilitates all the points and ensures that no one is ever without capital when they’re unemployed or if you have been in an accident and you cannot work = you’ll still have an income; the same applies if you have a family and the bread owner dies, the family still has an income. All the points where insurance existed which has been the recipient where people has placed their money, has caused such major havoc in the world within the financial sector because this money then goes into the stock markets to mess with the world food prices and to come with the idea that apparently ‘there are ways to make money’ so it becomes part of the global market casino. The end of this casino is possible with Living Income Guaranteed, although other corporations will still probably want to benefit from it and have shareholding, that will still happen; but your shareholding will no longer be vested in major corporations or life insurance companies, it will be the individual that will invest through their bank – and the bank being one of their own businesses in which they have shares that will facilitate and manage the investment in the privately owned and financed corporations, so that the distribution of money and the management of the system becomes highly efficient. 
 All of this can be computerized with great simplicity as a mechanism that can be trusted once placed and tested. This is how we can reduce the problems coming from humans making mistakes, because with the machine and with software one can manage the distribution, the placement of investments a lot easier. So, a citizen can decide that they want to support a particular business and buy shares in it and then once there is a profit declared by that company, the citizen benefits from the profit through dividends – these dividends are tax free, because there is no personal tax and there is also no corporate tax – so one can use that to spend on luxury items and so, the cash flow of the economy increases, which means job creation increases which means there are more jobs available for people that want to earn a better living and not only exist with a Living Income Guaranteed, yet Living Income Guaranteed is sufficient to make a decent living.

 Living Income and Minimum Wage 
 Posted on  July 2, 2013  Updated on  February 20, 2014 
 One of the big concerns that people have is that “If everyone gets a living wage, who is going to do all the dirty work?” because nobody wants to do it. So, in a Living Income Guaranteed approach it’s going to be vital to change the ‘living wage’ or the Basic Minimum Wage and here it is suggested that it should be at least double the Living Income Guaranteed so that it is a motivation for people that would like to live a more extravagant or luxurious life to actually do the work – whether it is a janitor, a road worker, a gardener, a child-minder, whomsoever works - and thus does not depend on the Living Income Guaranteed, gets a minimum wage that is double the Living Income Guaranteed, that will ensure that there is motivation for people to do the labor and for those that would like to improve their lives, while the Living Income Guaranteed ensures that everybody has got enough to make a decent living. 
 The difference between the two would merely be a measure of luxury and therefore, businesses will have to consider that wage – which is obviously an input on production – must be equated within the price. And so, pricing will be based on ensuring that there are minimum wages and that people earn very good incomes. This will obviously increase again the amount of money that can be spent and so the economy will grow, the house market, the motor car markets… all the markets that are now in extreme trouble and where the trouble is increasing will all grow and life on Earth will be sustainable. 
 So, for you that are ready to approach these issues, look at how to implement it in your particular countries, translate these proposals into your language, do blogs about it and get involved in your political parties, see which ones are willing to embrace a Living Income Guaranteed and if they are not: start a political party, because the way forward is political.
