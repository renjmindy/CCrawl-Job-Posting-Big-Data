 Me: I need to be a spy; or something like a spy 
 She: Thatâ€™s just movie stuff; youâ€™re worth more than that 
 Me: My ambition is to spark dark plots and international intrigue 
 She: Thereâ€™s no college curriculum that teaches those things 
 Me: I want my enemies to quake in their boots whenever someone whispers my name 
 She: We could train you as a tax auditor

 I'm going to have to look that one up. I'm a big fan of The Penguin on Top of Your Television and The Ministry of Silly Walks.

 That's brilliant. Ha! Ha! Ha! Clever as Hell.Now that's an unusual place. How perfectly lined up the two sets of dialogue, so at different purposes and as though in separate places, being that they were in different conversations and mind sets. The punch line was hysterical. You bring such amazement and great story telling every time I see what you did with the 5 words. I thank you so much. You hit the mark in the center. YES!

 Book Bandits and Prompts 
 
 In September 2012 I joined up with a group of writers calling themselves "OC Writers Guild" (A Merry Band of Book Bandits). We would meet on Saturdays at the CSMA Library and write. My fellow "book bandits" are a talented and gracious group. They still meet although I have moved out of the area. 
 
 Because I missed them so much I am trying to create an on-line writer's guild. Check it out hereâ€¦

 In real world, Happily Ever Afters are bittersweet miasma of memories (purely work of fiction and my psychotic imagination) also trigger warning: death, violence, disturbing imagery, etc
