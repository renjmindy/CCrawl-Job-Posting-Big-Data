 Disabled people around the world find themselves in an almost impossible position. They want to work and earn a living, but due to their disability they are restricted to just a few opportunities, depending on the severity of their disability. 
 On top of this, governments around the world are cutting back on the amount of benefits that disabled people can claim, even to the point of removing all benefits completely. 
 Life is hard enough for disabled people, so having any part of their income removed can make it almost possible to survive. 
 Not only that but it's a very worrying situation for the individual, and it will leave many in a state of fear as to what will happen next. 
 In the current global economic state there are hardly any jobs for an able bodied person, so what chance does a disabled person have of getting any sort of employment? 
 This is completely mind boggling because the simple answer to that isâ€¦no chance! 
 This obviously leads to disabled people turning to the Internet for some kind of income. Millions of able bodied people have created successful online careers over the last 10 - 15 years, so what's stopping disabled people doing the same? 
 Absolutely NOTHING! 
 Before we go any further though, it's worth pointing out that not all opportunities that you will discover online are as good as they seem. 
 If they were, I wouldn't be running this website, and I wouldn't receive 100's of emails and comments each week from people who have been scammed out of their hard earned cash. 
 For a disabled person with very little income, falling for just one scam is enough to put them in a very difficult position financially. 
 I advise that you proceed with caution and take the time to look over my website and check to see how I rate any opportunity that you might have heard of. 
 Also read my advice on  spotting scams and dealing with them  in the right way if you suspect that something isn't right. 
 Most of my recommendations are completely free or free to try, so you do not have to worry about spending money on something that might not work for you. 
 A good example of this is  my highest recommended product  that has proven to be very popular with people with disabilities. 
 I also tell you about any 'hidden' costs when I write a review so you will know from the start how much you might need to spend in the future. 
 Ultimately you need to consider the restrictions placed upon you by your disability when choosing your ideal type of work from home opportunity. 
 Consider your time commitment and how long you are able to spend at your computer before things get difficult for you. 
 Find an opportunity that suits you best, and then create a timetable outlining when you are able to fully commit without any distractions or issues with your health. 
 This is vital if you are to maximize your earning potential online. 
 The beauty of working online from home is that you have complete control over your hours of work, and this is very beneficial for a disabled person. 
 To give you an insight, one of the content writers who helps here at Work From Home Watchdog is registered with disabilities and it prevents him from being able to do a 'normal' job. 
 However, he has found his calling by working online from home, as an Internet marketer. 
 This has opened up new avenues for him, and in particular he has gained respect and credibility in what he does. It has also changed his perspective on life and how others treat him as a person. 
 Gaining respect in this type of business has not only been beneficial to him, it also has to many others who he has inspired along the way. 
 Whatever direction you decide to take, I hope that the information here on Work From Home Watchdog is beneficial to you as you search for a work from home job that suits you and your situation. 
 The Internet now provides more opportunities than ever before for people who cannot work a 9 - 5 job due to disabilities.
