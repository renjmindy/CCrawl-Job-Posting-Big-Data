 About HousingLOUISIANA 
 HousingLOUISIANA is a statewide alliance of housing practitioners and advocates whose primary goal is to ensure that the housing needs of all Louisianans are met. Through our statewide network of the nine regional housing alliances and working groups in New Orleans, Shreveport, Baton Rouge, Lafayette, Lake Charles, Northshore, Monroe, Alexandria and Houma-Thibodaux, we work to better coordinate advocacy efforts and build better collaborations across the state.    Incubated at HousingNOLA and modeled after GNOHA – New Orleans’ comprehensive housing alliance launched in 2007, HousingLOUISIANA provides technical support to each of the member housing alliances and helps to build their capacity by connecting them to resources and trainings offered by several of HousingLOUISIANA’s national partners which include: National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC); National Coalition for Homelessness; National Community Reinvestment Coalition (NCRC); Community Change; and several national philanthropic partners such as the Ford Foundation, among others.    HousingLOUISIANA is in the process of establishing a statewide resident organizing group, starting with residents of affordable housing. There is a lack of political will from elected officials that prevents housing justice from moving forward within our state, and we can begin to address this by engaging low and moderate income renters living in subsidized housing to build statewide power for affordable housing advocacy. Those most impacted by the issue can better inspire elected officials and help their understanding, helping us create and push a housing agenda that would result in economic growth, new jobs, and new homes for a better Louisiana for everyone. Investments in grassroots resident leadership empowers other residents and community members to address classism, racism, and other forces of marginalization in their own lives and challenges structures of power that have led to systemic inequality. The goal of HousingLOUISIANA is to help build resident community capacity while serving the needs of housing alliance members throughout the state.
