 Award for Career-promoting & fair Trainee Program 
The WidasConcepts trainee program will be honoured with the Absolventa award. 
 
 The award “Career-promoting and fair trainee-program” is given to organisations who are committed to high-quality trainee programs and formulate their own programs accordingly. The aim behind this initiative is to award a top notch training program. The “Charter career-promoting and fair trainee program” forms the basis of the award, says Absolventa. 
As reported by the LMU Muenchen or the South German newspaper, we are one among the 60 organisations to be awarded the Absolventa award from Absolventa Gmbh and its partner.
