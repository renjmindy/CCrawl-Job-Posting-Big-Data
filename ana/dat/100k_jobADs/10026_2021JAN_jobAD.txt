 Skin Type: Normal to dry 
 Hey there! 
 Some time back, I came across the Fiama Celebration Pack that contains 5 different gel bars. Today, I am sharing my thoughts on the Lemongrass and Jojoba variant that I have been using for a while now. So letâ€™s jump straight into the review and see how this one fared out for me. Keep readingâ€¦ 
 What The Brand Claims  : When your mood needs a lift, this gel bar will be a gift with fragrance and skin conditioners too. Get refreshed skin and be the new you. 
 If smooth skin is what you miss, look no more, Lemongrass and Jojoba it is. 
 Packaging  : The soap bar comes in a beautiful green-colored cardboard box that looks absolutely beautiful and instantly catches oneâ€™s attention. It clearly mentions all the important details such as date of manufacturing, date of expiry, ingredient list, price as well as net product weight. 
 As you open the cardboard box, there is a silver foil covering that holds the product inside. Overall, I really liked the packaging. Itâ€™s attractive, travel friendly and feels luxurious too! ðŸ™‚ 
 Ingredient List  : 
 My Experience With The Product  : Fiama Lemongrass and Jojoba Soap Bar is green in color and is a gel-based product. Even though it appears to be bigger inside the box, the size is actually quite average. Anyways, it produces a good amount of lather when comes in contact with water and effectively does the job of cleansing. It removes all the dirt and impurities from the skin and leaves it clean, smooth and refreshed. 
 Since I have normal to dry skin, even though it does not leave my skin parched or craving for moisture, I always do follow up with a moisturizer afterwards. Rinsing the product is also quick and fuss-free as it easily comes off with water in one go. It does not leave behind any residue at all and makes the skin squeaky clean, which is great! 
 The soap has a thoroughly refreshing scent that is just amazing, and lingers on for a long time. In fact, you can even faintly smell it after a few hours too, which can get bothersome for those with sensitive noses. I feel this would be a great pick for summers and the product can be bought as a single bar as well as a value pack. 
 Yays!

 Final Thoughts  : Fiama Lemongrass and Jojoba Gel Soap Bar lathers up well and effectively cleanses the skin. It removes all the dirt, dust and impurities and leaves the skin clean and fresh. Rinsing the product off is also quick and fuss-free and it does not leave any residue behind. It has thoroughly refreshing scent that lingers on for a long time. The product can be easily found online as well as in stores. 
 Overall, I would say that this is a decent soap bar from the house of Fiama, but I am not really impressed! I feel it is definitely overpriced and even then, the quantity provided is just average. Also, the scent can get bothersome for those with sensitive noses and the product gets consumed quickly too. So, if you are looking to try out a new soap bar, then you can definitely give this a try! As for me, I would not be repurchasing this! 
 Till next time, 
 XOXO
