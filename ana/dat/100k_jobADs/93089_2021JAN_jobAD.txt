 King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) is a major new graduate university focused on becoming a leader in science and technology research and graduate education.

 Job Summary:

This position is responsible for library collections and instructional and outreach services to faculty, researchers and students in assigned subject areas. 
 Sarah P.’s comment  : Be very careful of accepting a contract in Saudi Arabia. I worked in Saudi Arabia and did actually enjoy my time there. However I did my research before I applied. While there are some reputable companies, colleges, and schools please be aware that you are at the mercy of the institution which hires you. KAUST has very mixed reviews and like many places in Saudi, was started with great promise and has fallen. If you do apply know that it is a long and tedious process with very little logic as to who is chosen. Google ‘Kaust’ and ‘reviews’ for more info.
