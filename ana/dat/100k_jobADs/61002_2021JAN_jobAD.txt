 New Job, New Year, New Me, New You? 
 January 2, 2018  by  RBL G33K 
 A new year. 
 A new job. 
 A new perfectly profound personality pool. 
 Laughter will ensue…has ensued…will be suing… Okay, maybe not the last part, but you get the picture. 
 The new crew is vast, and ever changing, which means names  will be  changed to protect the far from innocent. 
 And we start the year with “Today’s Random Statement,”…. 
 
 “I think I need a stronger vibrator…” 
 
 When said loudly, and with no prior context…or visual clues… would your first thought be about a cell phone? Ya, neither would ours. 
 Welcome to 2018! 
 Yours Faithfully, 
R3b3l G33k
