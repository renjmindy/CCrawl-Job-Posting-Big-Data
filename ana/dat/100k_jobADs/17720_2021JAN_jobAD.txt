  #1 Thing Recruiters Want You To Know About Getting A Job AppDynamics  
 Ariella Coombs 
 September 27, 2017 
 AppDynamics , an IT Operations Analytics company based in San Francisco, California, is looking for fresh talent to join its team. If you’re thinking about getting a job at AppDynamics, there’s one thing the hiring team REALLY wants you to know before you go in for an interview. 
 ...You NEED to have a clear understanding of the company. 
 "I expect candidates to be familiar with our company and space - what we do, and what value they can bring to the table,” said Heidi Newiger, Global University & Diversity Recruitment Programs Manager at AppDynamics. “I understand the hiring landscape is competitive, but doing a bit of research on what the company does, any notable press and what it's like to work there is important to do prior to your first call with a recruiter.” So, here are some ways you can do your homework on AppDynamics BEFORE your interview...  Google it!  It seems simple, but you usually can find all of the information you need to have a basic understanding of a company from a simple Google search. There’s no reason to be stumped by the question “What do you know about us?” when you have Google at your fingertips.  Visit the company website.  Don’t just look at the careers page, either. Read the company’s story, understand the mission, notice the language they use, and so on. Take note of things you might otherwise miss by just going straight to the careers page.  Go to the company Glassdoor page.  Look at employee reviews, read the Overview section, view the photos, and so on. Glassdoor is like a one-stop shop for all of this information, so be sure to check it out.  Talk to employees.  The best way to learn about the company is to talk to the people who work there. What do they love most about the company? How would they describe the environment? What are their favorite projects to work on? Learn as much as you can by connecting with people on LinkedIn and starting conversations. 
 BONUS: Prepare thoughtful questions relating to what you learned. 
 If you really want to stand out to recruiters at AppDynamics, take what you’ve learned about the company and ask thoughtful questions. “Something else I look for is thoughtful questions from the candidate,” said Newiger. “Have they thought about the company and role, and what working will look like? I want to see that they are seriously thinking about how the job would fit into their life." Most employers will be impressed that you took the time to not only research the company, but also went a step further and found things you genuinely want to learn more about - things you can’t get the answers to in a Google search. This shows that you’re not only enthusiastic for the opportunity, but you’re also curious about learning more. 
 Getting A Job At AppDynamics 
 Getting a job at AppDynamics is much easier when you know what recruiters are looking for from candidates. If you need additional help with your job search,  check out Work It Daily’s trusted, easy-to-use career support platform .  Photo credit: AppDynamics  on Glassdoor.com
