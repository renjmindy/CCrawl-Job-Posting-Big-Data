 A New Job - And New Photos 
 Published on  November 27, 2014June 28, 2017  by  Lily Hartley 
 My apologies for the lack of posts in recent months - but I managed to land myself a proper grown-up job, and it's had me rather busy! 
 I'm proud to be able to tell you that I'm now the content writer, photographer and blogger for Maxwell Scott Bags, a luxury leather goods company based in York. 
 They make the most gorgeous Italian leather briefcases, handbags, luggage and more, all designed in Britain. 
 I was lucky enough to recently photograph their Autumn/Winter fashion campaign, which was a fantastic and exciting opportunity for me. 
 
 
 
 
 Keep up with what I'm doing by visiting  The Journal , the blog I'm running for Maxwell Scott Bags. You can also see the rest of the photographs from the fashion shoot there too! 
 
 It's got fashion, photography, culture, food, travel… Everything you could want from a blog! Let me know what you think of my work, all feedback is appreciated.
