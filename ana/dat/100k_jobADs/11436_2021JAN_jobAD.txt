 Some hilarious footage of Biden in this, and a great discussion of what a charlatan Obama is.

 Trace, the message I get loud and clear from the US ruling elite is that the American people get no say any more in choosing their leaders. It's like they're rubbing our noses in it.

 Not to be a stickler about this but in truth WE the people NEVER have in our entire history. 
 It has ALWAYS been the moneyed interests who carried the day. 
 But the “words” were always “right to vote” and “freedom”. 
 Same as it every was ……….

 Psychopathy seems to be one of the requirements for the job of POTUS. Trump's a psychopath. Obama's a psychopath. Dubya's a psychopath. The Clinton's are psychopaths. And on and on. Our political system is a psychopathocracy.

 Good one!!.. But think about it - Biden comes up with some 'real doozies'!..If Biden doesn't do rallies, 'we will have less entertainment', surely we will miss that part..

 Good point, Deb. The entertainment value of presidential is their only value at this point. To be honest, though, I would be willing to sacrifice the entertainment for a real voice in government.
