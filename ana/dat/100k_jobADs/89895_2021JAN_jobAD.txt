 About STEM NOLA 
 STEM NOLA was founded by New Orleans native, and former tenured Tulane University Engineering professor, Dr. Calvin Mackie. Its purpose is to expose, inspire and engage members of the community in learning about opportunities in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).    STEM NOLA designs and delivers activities, programs & events that bring inspiration, motivation and training to all STEM stakeholders, specifically focusing on under-served communities, across the city. Participants receive the opportunity to obtain 21st Century skills of Communication, Collaboration and Critical Thinking.    STEM NOLA realizes that any effective community-based STEM program must be broad enough to include everyone, yet focused enough to reach the people where they are, on their level, and, taking them to where they need to be to compete, and succeed in life. The mission of STEM NOLA is to grow future Innovators, Creators, and Entrepreneurs through inspiration, engagement, and exposure to STEM. Members of the community will learn about opportunities in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM). The Core Goals of STEM NOLA are:    To help youth develop an interest in STEM and STEM-Based learning activities.    To develop the capacities of youth to engage in STEM-Based activities for learning and recreation.    To inspire youth to value the opportunities and possibilities of STEM-Based careers.    To help youth develop the necessary, and transferable 21st Century skills of Communication, Collaboration and Critical Thinking. The greatest strength of the STEM NOLA program is that it is developed to be culturally, and environmentally-relevant by using project-based activities, and hands-on designed learning to Expose, Inspire, and Engage students in grades K-12. By using college students, who are specializing in STEM-Based studies, as well as corporate volunteers as instructors and mentors, K-12 students are afforded the opportunity to see themselves as STEM-Based career participants.
