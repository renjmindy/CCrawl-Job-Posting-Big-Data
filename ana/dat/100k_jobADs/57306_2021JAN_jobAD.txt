  How To Use Twitter As A Job Search Tool  
 Stacy Harshman 
 September 12, 2013 
 When I suggest using  Twitter as a job search tool , I often get blank stares and responses such as, “Twitter, really? I’m not into the whole tweeting thing.” The good news is you don’t have to be. You can be an observant follower and still reap many benefits. Twitter gives you free information about people, organizations, and job listings. 
 
 Start To Follow People And Organizations 
 Following someone on Twitter simply means receiving their posts which are called “tweets.” Every time the person posts a new message, it appears on your home page in real time. To start the process, use the search function to find people or organizations you want to follow. Once you find them, click on the follow button and you will begin instantly receiving their updates. The best part about Twitter is that you don’t need to get the person’s permission. Anyone on Twitter can follow any person or organization. 
 Who Do You Follow? 
 Begin by following organizations you are interested in pursuing. Next, follow employees in your  target companies . The information you will receive will be valuable in helping you research the culture and mission of an organization. 
 Job Listings 
 An easy way to search for openings is to use the hash tag sign or what some people refer to as the pound sign which is the # symbol. The hash tag is Twitter’s filing system. For example, if you search #Seattle and #jobs, you will find tweets for openings in Seattle. 
 Start Now 
 Take your first step of setting up your free account. Go to  www.twitter.com  and click on the “Sign up now” button. Within minutes you will have access to information that might just help you  land your dream job . Photo Credit:  Shutterstock
