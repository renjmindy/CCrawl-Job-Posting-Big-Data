  Feel Like A Failure at Job Search, What Should I Do?  
 Work It Daily 
 March 18, 2009 
 Dear Experts, I am seriously depressed. Since being laid-off in November, I have applied to 248 jobs... and not a single one has called. I've revamped my resume too many times to count, written more detailed cover letters than I ever thought I'd write in my entire life, been to job fairs, e-mailed to former colleagues, and done just about every other thing you can imagine. Any suggestions for someone who literally feels defeated? I can't even get a job at the local fast food place. What do you do when you feel like nobody wants you? It's getting tough to get out of bed in the morning. I'm plowing through my savings and may have to ask a family member if I can move in with her. This is the most humiliating experience of my life. How do I turn things around?  Our Twitter Advice Project (T.A.P.) is no longer an active campaign. To find an answer to the above question, please use the "Search" box in the right-hand column of this website.
