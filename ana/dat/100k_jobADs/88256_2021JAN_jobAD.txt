 Gleeson are currently supporting a fast growing manufacturing business to recruit a Financial Controller. This is a fantastic opportunity ideally pitched at a newly qualified accountant looking to take on their first Financial Controller role is a growing business who have seen significant growth over recent years. 
 This is a varied role where you can't be too precious over duties... you may be raising invoices, chasing late payments or you may be working with the CEO to develop strategy and work on budgets and forecasting. Fast forward a few years and there's a strong chance that this position will become a directorship role. 
 The Financial Controller will lead a small team of 3 staff including two clerks and a financial administrator. Staff management is not a prerequisite for the role but would be advantageous. The Controller will be part of a small senior management team in the business and play an active role in the business strategy and growth plans. 
 The ideal candidate will have worked in an SME before or perhaps a divisional role within a larger group. You will need to be a qualified accountant CIMA or ACCA (upto 5 years post qualified) and have the ambition to develop with the growth plans for the business. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
