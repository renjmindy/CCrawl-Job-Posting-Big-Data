 About Edge  ** ** 
 Edge is the accessible, AI-powered, end-to-end solution that allows Influencer Agencies and Brands to create campaigns, sign Smart Contracts with influencers, leverage data, and automate contract completion and payments. 
 What's unique about Edge is that we do all this,  in just one platform  - reducing time, effort and cost in setting up, launching, tracking, completing and paying out on campaigns that brands run with influencers. Influencers love our platform too - an intuitive UX, with real time updates of contract progress and immediate payment on completion. 
 Although we are a startup employing 12 (?) people, we have a combined 50+ years of experience in technology and gaming. Founded in 2018, our founders are a former sports lawyer, a former video games executive and a 17 year old hailed by Forbes as 'as the future of computer science'. We want great humans to help us fly this rocket ship.
