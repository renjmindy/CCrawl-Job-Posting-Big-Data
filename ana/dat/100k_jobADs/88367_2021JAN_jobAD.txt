 Ryanair and Spanish pilot union SEPLA agree on pay cuts to save Spanish jobs 
 Ryanair made this announcement: 
 Ryanair welcomed SEPLA’s acceptance for Spanish Pilots of a 4-year agreement, which includes a  20% pay reduction  restored over 4 years, along with productivity improvements on rosters, flexible working patterns and annual leave to minimize Spanish Pilot job losses. This agreement gives Ryanair a framework to flex its operation during the COVID-19 crisis and a pathway to recovery when the business returns to normal in the years ahead. 
 The SEPLA agreement was overwhelmingly accepted by more than 80% of Ryanair’s Spanish Pilots, demonstrating that Ryanair Pilots and their Union are willing to work with the company during the COVID-19 crisis where Ryanair will carry significantly less traffic, at much lower fares for the foreseeable future. Just this week Ryanair announced further 20% reductions to its September and October flight capacity as forward bookings have notably weakened. 
 Ryanair has demonstrated its ability to work with unions and conclude these agreements across its European operation, including now with our Spanish pilots. Regrettably in Spain it has been impossible to reach an agreement with the cabin crew unions USO and SITCPLA who – uniquely in Europe – continue to obstruct necessary cost savings putting jobs and tourism links at risk. In every other EU market where Ryanair operates, we have been able to negotiate agreements to save jobs, improve productivity and reduce costs in response to the Covid-19 crisis both with Pilot and Cabin Crew Unions. Sadly USO’s and SITCPLA’s failure to negotiate or meaningfully engage will now mean that Spanish Cabin Crew job losses are now more likely as we have no agreement with Spanish cabin crew unions.
