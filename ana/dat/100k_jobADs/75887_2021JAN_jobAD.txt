 Student Leaf Raking 
 LocalStudent 
 __Richmond Hill, ON 
 Apply Now 
 Looking for a job where you can fully choose your own working hours, be your own boss, and get paid $24-$28 per hour on average? Look no further. LocalStudent is the new way for students to find work. 
 We are now hiring Leaf Rakers for the Fall. LocalStudent was created by students, for students. We know that typical student jobs suck (working in fast food or retail) so we created a job that allows you to stay active while being outdoors and the ability to social distance. Plus, you have full flexibility with your schedule. 
 How it works: We are like Uber for leaf raking and snow shovelling. We have hundreds of customers all across the Greater Toronto Area who need their leaves raked and snow shovelled. You go on our website, simply choose which customers you want to service and when. It's that simple. 
We pay a flat rate per job. For example, a small yard pays around $50 on average and can be completed in around 1-2 hours if you work quickly, whereas a very big yard can pay $300+ and could take around 8 hours or so. 
 Spots on our team are very limited. To apply, visit https://localstudent.enginehire.io/students
