 Human Resources Department and Position Job Descriptions 
 Working in human resources is a challenge because the roles and responsibilities are so diverse. That is especially true when it comes to job descriptions for both human resource and generalist type roles as well as recruiting roles which is why we've developed for you a repository of job post templates and descriptions for HR and recruitment roles within your organization. 
 For those of you who are curious about our methodology and work when it comes to job descriptions, you can  click here  to access this handy job description template we've developed. You can also access the template in either PDF or Google Doc. We use this in the work that we do in our job description development as a way to organize, focus and optimize our job posting and description efforts. Your job posting is a marketing document that should be designed for the user to skim easily and also be optimized for search engines like Google, Bing, and others to crawl and determine which keywords are most important to explain the role, the job title, location, and important job responsibilities.
