  How To Successfully Change Careers After A Layoff  
 Aaron Sanborn 
 December 04, 2020 
   
 For most workers, being laid off or furloughed is a scary thought, and unfortunately this scary thought became a reality for many professionals who had their jobs impacted by COVID-19. 
 However, for some, losing their job is the push they need to make a career change. 
 It's not as crazy as it sounds!  Some people need a change but are too afraid to make one, and losing their job is the perfect opportunity to do so. In addition, many workers who lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 crisis may find that it will be  difficult to get back into the industries  they were working in. Career change isn't easy, but with an organized approach, it can be done successfully. It won't happen overnight, but with patience and commitment, you can ultimately end up in a better place. Here's what you need to know about the career change process as you embark on the job hunt. 
 Commit To A Career Change Plan 
 Before committing to a career change, make sure you're ready to close the door on your current career. A career change should not be an impulse decision or strictly driven by the trauma of a layoff. So, it's important to take some time to really think things over. But, if your decision comes from a prolonged period of career unhappiness, then the time may be right. Identify the new industry that you're looking to get into and then create an  interview bucket list  of 10-12 companies where you would like to work. Take a self-inventory of yourself and identify the transferable skills you possess that would also apply well to this new industry. Identify where you need to upskill. What skills are you missing for this new position? Come up with a plan for gaining these skills. Attend training courses, workshops, classes, or certification opportunities. 
 Changing Careers Is About Who You Know 
 Now that you've drafted a career change plan, the real challenge begins: building your network. When applying to a new industry, it's not enough to just apply online and pray that you'll get an interview. You have to put the work in. Go to the company's website or LinkedIn account to identify the human resources manager and the company's key players. Try to make an actual connection. Tap into your current network to see if you already know someone working at the company or have a friend who does know a current employee. Use any connection you make to learn more about the company and to tell your career story, where you've been, and why you are choosing to change careers. Any connection that you make is a foot in the door. This is a much more efficient way to conduct a job search, rather than just applying for every online job posting (spray and pray). Most resumes don't even make it past the Applicant Tracking System (ATS). In addition to trying to secure an interview, putting in this work will also help you build networking skills and expand your professional network. No matter where you are in your career, it always pays to network. This would also be a good time to update your  LinkedIn profile , too. 
 Ease Your Way To Your Dream Job 
 What if you could get a job at the company you want to work for, just not at the position that you wanted? That would actually be a career victory. When it comes to career changes, very rarely can you just switch lanes and land your new dream job. Sometimes you need to ease your way in. If you're struggling to get the position you want within a certain company, research other positions inside that company to see if there are any positions that better fit into your current skill sets. If there is, apply for that position. That way you at least get a job at the company. From there, you can figure out a way to  gain the skills that you need , so that you can one day move into your dream position. 
 Beware! Career Changes Come With Salary Implications 
 This may be hard to believe, but when it comes to a career change, sometimes salary is the last thing that you think about. That's because the career change process is so involved. It takes a lot of effort to come up with a plan and eventually secure an interview. Salary considerations are something that get placed on the temporary back-burner.  But, if you've reached the point in the process where it's time to discuss salary, you've done something right and don't want things to unravel. Depending on the type of industry you're going into, you'll be looking at either a salary increase, decrease, or match. It's essential that you do your research about the position and the average salary for such a position in your geographical area. Websites such as  salary.com  and  glassdoor.com  can be good resources for this information. Having this information could be helpful in  salary negotiations , or at the very least mentally prepare you, particularly if you're facing a salary decrease. It's also important not to lie when asked about your current salary in order to get a higher salary. It never pays to be dishonest. Being laid off and then deciding to change careers is a lot to take on. If you're organized and committed, you can do it, but you don't have to do it alone!

  3 Easy Ways To Offer Value To Your LinkedIn Connections  
 Ariella Coombs 
 Aaron Sanborn 
 November 20, 2020 
   
 Those interested in career trends probably already know about the importance of making new connections on LinkedIn and optimizing their profiles. 
 However, one thing that many professionals still struggle with is offering value to their professional network. 
 Offer value to your network? What does that even mean? This means communicating with your network consistently, not just when you're on the job hunt and need something from one of your connections. So, how do you offer value to your professional network? Sometimes opportunities will present themselves where you'll come across connections that are in need of knowledge or skills that you possess. Make a note of what they are looking to do and ask yourself, “How can I help this person with their business initiatives? What support, resources, or connections can I offer them?" Once you figure all of that out, you'll be serving your network in no time. Here are three  SUPER  easy ways to offer value to your LinkedIn connections:  
 Share An Article 
 This is the easiest way to start a conversation and/or keep in touch with a contact by offering value. Consider this person's industry, interests, and special projects. What can you find on their LinkedIn profile? What have you learned about them in your conversations? If you come across an article (or video) that you think they would find interesting or helpful, don't be afraid to share it with them. You could say something like, "Saw this article and thought of you! Wanted to share. Enjoy!" That's it—easy. They will appreciate the gesture and will keep you in mind! You can also just share articles on your feed for your entire network to see, with a message like "I thought this article made some good points. What do you think?" This could potentially lead to some good exchanges, and meaningful conversations with connections that you haven't spoken to in awhile. Posting content is also a good way to  make use of your own profile  and stay relevant. 
 Share Their Content With Your Network 
 Sharing content works both ways, and another easy way to offer value to your LinkedIn connections is to share their articles and posts with your network. If you found a blog post from one of your connections really interesting, share it with your network by publishing it to your LinkedIn feed with a brief blurb. (Don't forget to tag the author with the @ feature!). They'll appreciate the gesture, and will likely remember that the next time you share something. Sharing or commenting on a connection's article is also a great way to reconnect. It sure beats sending a message that says "just checking in." Another important thing to remember is it doesn't matter if you're sharing your own content, or someone else's. You're still being active on LinkedIn and staying in front of people. This is a great way to build your  personal brand . 
 Introduce A Connection 
 via GIPHY If you think someone in your network could benefit from connecting with one of your connections, you could shoot them a quick message saying something like: "I noticed you're looking to break into the entertainment industry. I'd love to introduce you to Jody Smith. She works as a talent agent out in L.A. and I'm sure she'd be a valuable addition to your network. Would you be interested in getting an introduction?"  Just make sure you ask your other connection if the introduction is appropriate before offering him/her up! This is known as  super connecting . Once again, this is something that could come back to benefit you if you find yourself in a position to make a career change and are hunting for a job. Always be willing to offer value to your network when you don't need it, so that when you actually do, your professional connections will be more than willing to help! Also, the more you network, the better  networking habits  you develop. Do you need help with your job search? Work It Daily can help!

  3 Ways To Upskill While Not Working Your Dream Job  
 Belen Chacon 
 Aaron Sanborn 
 November 10, 2020 
   
 With economic uncertainty and the ever-increasing competitive job market, it's not uncommon for job seekers to take a job that isn't in their target industry. 
 Although it's tough to stay happy at a job you don't necessarily want, that doesn't mean there isn't an opportunity to grow professionally. 
 No matter what profession you work, the more effort you put into advancing your skills, the better your chances are of growing into your role, or setting yourself for an opportunity in your desired industry. If you're worried you might not be getting the experience you need, here are three ways to keep fortifying your professional talents. 
 Actively Seek Ways To Use Your Skills At Work 
 Whether you're a writer working in sales or a business major working at a bank, there's always some way of using the skills you've studied and practiced—wherever you go. You just have to actively seek it out.  For instance, if you're looking to be a reporter someday, but your current job involves office administration, find a way to make up writing projects to help strengthen your craft. Perhaps you could write a summary of the company on the company website, blog about the company, or even try to connect with other vendors via social media. There are always ways to hone the skills you've already gained to  add value to your current workplace . 
 Ask The Boss To Give You More Responsibilities 
 Taking on tougher tasks will help challenge you in the work field, and asking your employer  for more responsibilities  shows that you're not afraid of a challenge. It also helps you stand out from the other employees in all the right ways.   It's a win-win: you get to put your skills into practice and your employer has less work to think about.  Besides, even if your current job isn't in your professional industry, not excelling at a job doesn't exactly make you look like a professional. 
 Start A Blog And Utilize Social Media 
 Even if you're not into blogging, tweeting, or posting on other people's walls, learning how to market your company will help you learn more about who you're working for. The more you know about your employer's business, the easier it will be for you to figure out how you can continue to be a valuable asset to that company. In addition, this shows additional initiative. Employers love employees that are always offering new ideas that can save or make the company money. The more you contribute, the more you make yourself an  indispensable employee.   From all these efforts, you may end up growing fond of the job you're working. And even if you don't, you're making legitimate attempts to grow professionally, and gaining valuable experience and skills that will eventually help you land your dream job.

  How To Stand Out At A New Job (And Fit In Too)  
 Andria Corso 
 Aaron Sanborn 
 November 05, 2020 
   
 Congratulations! After months of job hunting, you finally got hired for the job you wanted! 
 Getting a new job is exciting. However, after the dust settles from celebrating this accomplishment, you have some work to do. 
 Being a new employee can be tough sometimes. But if you're ready to embrace the challenge, you can make a smooth career change. Here are a few tips to make sure you start your new job on the right foot. 
 Understand The Company Culture 
 First, take time to get to know the culture of your new company. The best way to do this is to schedule meetings with your team—both those who will be working for you and with you.  Ask them questions about their work routine and how they get things accomplished. It's also a good idea to get a sense of how easy or difficult it is to implement new ideas and initiatives. This will give you a good feel for how adaptable (or how slow) the company culture is to change. You should also take note of your own workplace personality and how it fits into the company culture. If you're in need of a good personality test, try Work It Daily's FREE  Workplace Personas Quiz. 
 Identify The Key Stakeholders 
 Next, find out who the key stakeholders are for your specific role and meet with them. For example, if you are entering a company as a finance manager, find out who the key business leaders are that you will be supporting in your position.  Take time to build relationships with them and understand their primary financial concerns. You should also take time to get to know their work routines, and the best times and ways to communicate with them. While communication is important, it's also important to respect each others' schedules. 
 Find A Work Buddy 
 via GIPHY Another tip to help you get off on the right foot at the new job is to get a buddy. This should be a  peer who works  on the same team as you or in the same department as you. This person will help you figure out who's who and give you some inside information on some of those office politics . It's important to understand the team dynamic so you don't step on anyone's toes or disrupt the culture when you first get there. Your buddy is also there for you to ask questions such as, "How do I order office supplies?" or, "How do I set up my voice mailbox?" 
 Show Your Commitment To The Job 
 Next, have a career  conversation with your boss .  This lets him or her know you're serious about and committed to growing your career.  When you first start working at your new company, you may not know enough (yet) to speak specifically about the career paths available there. However, take time to have a conversation with your manager about your aspirations.  Share information about your desires to advance and grow as well as specific information about your strengths and the areas you'd like to develop. Ask your manager for input on your career plan and then use it as a living, active document. 
 Make A 30-60-90 Day Plan 
 Finally, it always helps to have a  30-60-90 day plan  as you start a new job. Document the details of what you want to accomplish in your first three months. (For example, the specific people you want to meet with, the tasks you want to accomplish, etc.) It also helps to share this plan with your manager so you can get some input.  There may be some things missing that your manager views as being critical to accomplish in the first 90 days.  Remember to be flexible with your plan as things may change and objectives you set for the first three months may shift as you get more involved and begin to learn more about your new job.  You want to be seen as committed to meeting the objectives you set, yet flexible enough to deal with changes. By implementing these few simple items, you can get off to a great start at your new job and quickly begin to be viewed as a value-added asset at your new company. Looking for more great advice?

  4 Phrases Your Boss LOVES To Hear  
 Tracey Parsons 
 Aaron Sanborn 
 October 16, 2020 
   
 If you want to put yourself in a position to build a strong professional relationship with your boss, while growing your career and managing up, you have to prove yourself as a reliable employee. 
 Taking the right kind of initiative can go a long way towards strengthening your relationship with your boss. 
 It's important to keep in mind that managers are not only responsible for your role and responsibilities and to a degree your career; they're also responsible for their duties as well. If you really want to prove yourself to your boss, think of ways to work these four phrases into your workweek: 
 "Here's A Potential Solution" 
 Bosses hear a LOT of problems. And more often than not, they are expected to come up with the solution. The thing is: if it isn't their problem, they are not going to actively seek out solutions. Therefore, when you come to the boss with a problem, immediately follow it up with a proposed solution.  This accomplishes two things. First, it shows your manager that you are solution-oriented. You took the time to examine the problem and think about ways to address it.  Secondly, your solutions are essentially saving the boss time and energy and those are both gifts to your manager.  This approach is a  huge win for you  and the boss. 
 "Here's An Idea" 
 You should be a student of your company. You should be very familiar with the company goals, mission, and vision. You should also have a very good understanding of the company's challenges. When you know these challenges, you should spend some time each week working on  ideas to solve those challenges  that the company faces.   When you go to your manager to say you have an idea that will positively impact the company's bottom line, everyone wins.  Bosses should love to hear ideas on how to make things more efficient and more profitable. Look for these ideas whenever you have down time at work. 
 "Let Me Show You" 
 On time-strapped days, it is so much easier to show someone something than it is to tell them. When pitching something to a boss or sharing an idea or even solving a problem, show him/her what you are talking about. Sketch it out, give them a flow chart, or show them anything visual and talk them through it. If you can, make a quick prototype. It is so much easier than using just your words when the chances are good that the boss is distracted.  Think about it: when you show people what you are saying, you have captured two of their senses, hearing, and seeing. If you give them something to hold—even better (three senses). This gets their attention and allows them to truly evaluate what you are trying to do for the boss or the company. Always try to show people what you are talking about. It allows them to react to your idea in a more connected way. 
 "I Could Use A Little Mentoring" 
 Bosses are not solely responsible for your career. This is your responsibility.  If you need new challenges, want new opportunities, it is up to you to scope those out and present them to the boss. If you don't know how to do something or think that you could build out your skills even further, it is up to you to ask for mentorship. As the protégé, you must take the active role in carving out time for the relationship. When  you seek mentorship from your boss,  know that it may not be the boss that becomes your mentor. Your boss may not even be the right mentor. However, they can be the one who facilitates an introduction. When you ask for this type of guidance, your boss knows that you own your experience and will work to support you.  Building a solid relationship with your boss is key to getting where you want to go in your career. These relationships will follow you throughout your career. These bosses will likely one day be the person you call on to be a reference. And when it comes time to be a reference for you, you want them to say that you were solution-oriented, respectful of their time, and full of an entrepreneurial spirit.  Need more help landing a job?
