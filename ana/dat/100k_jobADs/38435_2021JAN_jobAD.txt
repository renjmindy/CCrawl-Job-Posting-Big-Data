 Help us build and scale our community-driven platform as a Senior Engineer 
 Role overview 
 Weâ€™re looking for a  Platform Engineer  to help make our vision a reality for the worldâ€™s developer community. Youâ€™ll be joining a small, friendly team of engineers who are excited about defining and building the next model of cloud development. Everyone is given a high level of trust and autonomy to deliver their best work. This doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™ll be working in isolation though; we have a wide range of experience within the team from startups to agencies to corporates and everything in between so if you need to ask questions or want to bounce ideas off someone else weâ€™ve got you covered. 
 Requirements 
 We use a wide range of technologies including: 
 
 Go - in particular the OSS Micro framework (https://github.com/micro/micro) of which we are the primary owners/maintainers 
 Kubernetes and Docker 
 Cockroach DB (https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach) 
 NATS (https://nats.io/) 
 Pulumi 
 
 You donâ€™t need to have experience with all of the above; just be open and excited to learn new things and improve the skills you already have. 
 What will you be working on? Everything and anything that will help us build and scale our platform. That could include new features on the OSS tools, core infrastructure automation, customer facing features to help our users build amazing services and APIs, or anything else. 
 Weâ€™re a  remote only  company but we try to keep collaboration high through frequent video calls, instant messaging, design docs and pull requests. We follow (loosely) the agile process with two week sprints, daily standups, sprint demos and planning. Weâ€™re still learning though and hope you can bring your ideas to add to and improve our company culture and ways of working. 
 Benefits 
 
 Stock options (youâ€™ll own a piece of the pie) 
 25 days of annual leave (+ public holidays) 
 Pension scheme 
 Flexible working hours 
 
 Equal opportunity statement 
 We believe that great teams reflect the diversity of the world we live in and we aim to build a workplace that is welcoming and comfortable to all. Weâ€™re an equal opportunity employer and we consider all applicants without regard to gender identity, race, sexuality, disability status or anything else.

 At Micro Services Inc we believe that writing, deploying, and running code has become too complex. We want to strip away all the excess and get developers focused back on the code and not the plumbing. Weâ€™re building M3O (pronounced "em-three-oh"); a cloud platform for microservices development (https://m3o.com/). A fully managed service which lets developers focus on writing code rather than managing the infrastructure. Micro is a powerful developer first focused platform for API and Go based microservices development. Move beyond Rails and Spring to the new cloud native development model.
