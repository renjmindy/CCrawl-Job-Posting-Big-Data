  10 Job Search Tips That Take Less Than One Minute  
 Work It Daily 
 September 01, 2011 
 We received the following question from one of our  CareerHMO  members and wanted to share it with our readers. 
 
 "I am curious if there are any job search tips  that take less than one minute to execute. What quick action can I take as a job seeker than can really enhance my job search? I need to feel like I'm being productive!" 
 We reached out to a community of career experts and asked for their advice. Here are the top 10 responses: 
 
 Google yourself.  Job seekers should take a few seconds to type their names into various search engines to ensure that the skeletons have stayed in their closets. [Advice by Jeff Diana | www.successfactors.com] 
 Post a detailed "elevator pitch" on your LinkedIn profile.  [Advice by Tom Toole | www.mrinetwork.com] 
 Phone a friend.  We all have life-lines, but often we are hesitant to use them! Pick up the phone and call a friend who may have a connection that can help get your foot in the door. [Advice by Dr. Woody | www.drwoody.com] 
 Write down a quote that inspires you,  and put it up somewhere you look regularly. Inspiration will keep you focused and positive, which means you'll be ready for that big interview when it comes. [Advice by Karlin Sloan | www.karlinsloan.com] 
 When you get an interview write a "Woowhoo!"  on your job search success calendar to remind you that your efforts are paying off. [Advice by Linda Hardenstein | www.lindahardenstein.com] 
 Identify what is most important to you -  geographic location, industry or company. This will drive all your future decision on job opportunities. [Article by Stuart Mease | www.stuartmease.com] 
 Hold yourself accountable.  Tell someone (a friend, a coach, a family member) each week what you plan to do to move your job search forward that week. Saying it aloud to someone else and having them follow-up with you often results in increased productivity. [Advice by Scott Rozmann | www.scottrozman.com] 
 Scan the business section.  A quick read of your local paper or news website’s business section can tell you a lot about what’s going on in your industry. You should know which companies have major projects in the works, which executives are moving up (or out) and how you could help a company with their next big move. [Advice by Denise Felder | www.denisefelder.com] 
 Stay positive.  No matter what your circumstances, be positive. No one cares about your sob story. It's about the employer. [Advice by Mark Grimm | www.markgrimm.com] 
 Use spell check!  Applying for a job is not the same as texting your friends. Use real words and actual sentences. If you don't, it looks like you are too lazy to spell out words. Definitely not the impression you want to make. [Advice by Maureen Mack | www.hrprincipal.com]
