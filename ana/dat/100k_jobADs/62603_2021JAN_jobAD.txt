 How to Make Cleaning Your Backyard a Breeze 
 Posted on  August 7, 2013  by  Tempe Thompson 
 Cleaning the backyard makes for a good workout, and saves you the considerable expense of getting it done by professional cleaners. With a  good hedge shear trimmer  at hand, you can easily carry out this task as a DIY project. 
 What Does Cleaning the Backyard Involve? 
 
 Clipping shrubs and back bushes, and pruning perennials 
 Cutting grass and ground cover 
 Cleaning benches, walkways, garage floors, doors and other objects in the backyard 
 
 Tools Needed 
 
 The major tool required is the hedge trimmer. Hedge trimmers come in different variants, and different variants offer different levels of performance and dependability. While the basic models simply do the task, high-end models incorporate features such as ergonomic handles, anti-vibration technology and precision-ground blades to deliver better output and make work easy and comfortable. You can either buy the equipment or rent it out depending on your requirement. 
 Other tools such as a  chainsaw , tree shears and  leaf blowers  may be required, depending on the landscape and the extent of cleaning required. 
 
 Cleaning Process 
 Cleaning the backyard is best undertaken methodically, in the following broad steps: 
 
 Remove large pieces of waste and debris, such as rocks, big boulders, and fallen down branches. 
 Cut off any small overhanging branches using tree shears. Cut off any big branches or the trees itself, if required, using a chainsaw. 
 Trim overgrown shrubs, back bushes, and perennials using the  hedge trimmer . 
 Use the hedge trimmer to trim and keep the hedge in shape.  Gas hedge trimmers  score over electric and battery powered ones for detailed and intricate landscaping works. These trimmers are also cordless, facilitating easy movement. 
 Mow the lawn. Use a  weed eater  to trim the edges around the base of trees and shrubs 
 Use a  leaf blower  to gather dead leaves into a pile, and either burn them or put them in a compost pit. 
 
 The right hedge trimmer, and an understanding of the process of clearing your backyard, will have you snipping away at your backyard easily and confidently.
