 I attended a caregiver and Hebrew Language training in Manila, year 2006. I have already undergone medical, Training, PDOS and already have my employer and Contract. The problem is that I failed in my medical due to a lung scar which is cleared by my doctor. I was wondering why I was not able to fly since everything is okey exept the clearance of my medical, since that scar is cured and will not cause anything not good to my health. I've spend so much going to manila from my place, Baguio City which is 6 hrs ride to manila. Please give me chance.I would be glad and happy if you can help me pursue and resume to this dream i have.Thank you so much and God Bless! 
Hope to hear from you regarding this. I hope my employer still need me. I have their addres with me

 Ms. Alconis, 
 Medical clearance is one of the requirements before you are allowed to enter any country. In your case, you said you are cleared by your doctor regarding the scar in your lung but recruitment agencies have their own accredited medical centers where they want their applicants to undergo medical examinations. And they are very strict when it comes to the medical examination results of their applicants. So if you did not pass the medical examinations done by the agency accredited medical centers, I'm afraid to say that you won't be able to travel or work abroad. 
 But don't forget that there is always a big chance that your lung scar will totally heal and can't be seen in your x-ray result. So my advice to you is to take care of your health before you decide to undergo another x-ray examination. And consult your doctor on what to do to totally eliminate the scar on your lung.

 Carmelita, 
 The only one who can decide the age limit for all applicants is the employer. But you can always try your luck in applying for any caregiver job vacancies I have posted on my website.

 Why the placement fee of caregiver in israel is very high? My friend pay 5500 US dollars and the other is 8000 US dollars. May I ask if the POEA is aware for this?
