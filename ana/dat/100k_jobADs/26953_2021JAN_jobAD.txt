 Another Lesson from Job -> 
 Struggling with Job but beginning to understand (I think) 
 Posted on  September 9, 2020  by  Pastor Jim Dixon 
 Reading Job, which has always been a difficult book for me to understand. God gives the devil permission to attack Job? Seems inconsistent with God’s character. 
 But, I think I’m beginning to understand. Job is no different from the rest of us. When Adam and Eve sinned, they released evil into the world, in essence giving the devil permission to attack. And, though we might blame God for our troubles, as Job did, in reality we are suffering the consequences of evil being released. Though Job blamed God, it was not God’s fault. 
 Because God has foreknowledge he knew the outcome before Job ever went through it. God does not cause evil to happen, though we might say He allows it. But, He will take what Satan means for evil and turn it around for our Good (Romans 8:28). 
 I wonder what would have happened if Job had asked God for deliverance rather than blaming God for his troubles.
