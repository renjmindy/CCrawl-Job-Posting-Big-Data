 It’s the end of the second month — Oh Wait! There’s still one day left? How did that happen? Well, this is because this wasn’t just any year, it is a leap year and a landmark 2020 the closing of the decade that you had look-forward to. If one of your 2020-goals was to settle into that dream job — you’ve about 10 months left to finally make the right move. 
 And, you’re in luck! Because  Workruit  makes finding the  best jobs in India  , easy and seamless experience. With the app, you can now connect with hiring managers across a variety of work-fields and locations on your mobile phone. So, read on to understand more about how the Workruit mobile app works — and how your dream job, is now  at your fingertips. 
 Workruit  was conceptualized to make job-seeking easy and hassle-free. On  Workruit  , you are only shown those job options that fits in your skills and interest areas. Adopting the model that popular dating app Tinder works on — Workruit works on the  concept of swiping right  , on a job option that you like. When the recruiter also looks at your profile and decides that you’re suitable for the role, they also  swipe right. 
 When both you and the recruiter swipe right on each other's cards or profile, we call it a ‘match’. Once a match is achieved, you’re directly connected to the recruiter over an in-app messenger that is easy-to-use and secure. You exchange information directly with the recruiter and set up an interview! It’s really as simple as that! 
 The advantage of this way of  finding the right job  is that you do not have to sift through hundreds of job profiles to identify what roles might suit you. Our machine learning algorithm does the job for you — and shows you only those jobs that are curated to your profile. You spend less time sorting through irrelevant jobs or writing pointless emails to companies that might most likely never even respond to your application. With  Workruit , you can rest assured that with a match — the employer is actually interested in pursuing a conversation with you. 
 Further, there are so many small features that make a big difference in the  Workruit   app  - 
 
 Instant resume:  With this feature, you can rest assured that your resume will be of industry-standard and unique — so your strengths stand out and your best qualities are highlighted for the recruiter to check out. 
 In-app messenger:  With the in-app messenger, you no longer have the hassle of dealing with multiple email threads or Whatsapp conversations. Keep all your job-search related conversations in one place, through one account. Your personal information is secure with us, and we do not share any details with anyone else, without your explicit permission. 
 Relevant jobs only:  With our AI-driven software, you will only see those job-cards that fit you. These results are customized to your need — so you are not wasting your valuable time on irrelevant searches
