 The work home community is an absolute place for scammers to breed and other opportunists. There are too many false offers and home base business in this kind of sites. There are those who do not collect money and there are those also who take a little amount of money from you. It is really hard to distinguish genuine and scam work home opportunity. But did you ever think why these jobs are enormous? Because mostly they are not legitimate businesses, though there are some that are legitimate. 
 But be aware also of those legitimate businesses since they are the target of these scammers. Scammers, because of their excellent knowledge of the internet, they can create a website that looks very similar to the legitimate site and there they will start their evil work. It needs a lot of time finding the legitimate one. 
 The most visible and obvious scam is when someone calls you or email you about a job offer that you never applied for or when you receive a mail informing you that you won lotto without even joining the site or worst without even placing a bet to them. These sites come from unknown sites and the offer can never be trusted. 
 
 How Scammers do it? 
 These scammers use home job sites and take some information to possible victim, taking your complete name, email address, telephone number, and some vital information about you and from there they will have the chance to contact you and start digging more about you until you come to trust them. Your information is taken from forums database, or in jobs online on people who are searching for jobs. They are positive that people like you is easy to lure with because they are the people that needs money and immediate income and they pretence that they are the legitimate source of the job you are applying for. 
 The moment this scammers got your mail address, then they will work on that false job to make you believe that they are legitimate, and they will make everything so that they will get your trust and finally convince you to provide them your account number and credit card. If you happen to receive a mail like this, all you have to do is to delete them immediately without reading them. 
 Responding to their mail is of no use and will only put you into trouble because this email is only a test to check if the information they get is valid or not. If they verify that the information is valid, they will provide more and more job openings. Jobs that you can never resist its offer; if you delete them and do not response to their mail they will not also dare to mail you because they will think that the email is invalid or inactive. 
 One thing that is also not good is some legit companies are selling information of their members for money. Another designation of a scam site is that, they post jobs per hour on a certain site even when no company is offering a certain job. They will promise you a better job and a promising income, but they require something, it could be a payment from you. 
 If ever you encounter a job offer like this; a company that take information from you like bank account, credit card or ask you to send money in place of the job offered, you can report them to crime complaintâ€™ center in the internet. Most of these scammers claim that they are registered with the FBI and the NWCC Center. If you care to report these kinds of sites to the crime center you will definitely help the internet jobs legal and safe from scammers.
