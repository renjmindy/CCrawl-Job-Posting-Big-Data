 Once in a while you will stumble upon the truth, but most of us manage to pick ourselves up and hurry along as if nothing had happened - Winston Churchill 
 Career 
 Moving to a new Kingdom 
 2014-10-012014-10-01 H√•kan Forss 9 Comments 
 After 3.5 years at  Avega Group , I have decided to move to a new Kingdom. As of the 6th of October I will start the next chapter of my professional saga. I will take employment at  King  in Stockholm as an internal coach. 
 
 It has been 3.5 awesome years at  Avega Group . I have been very lucky to work with some of the best people in the industry. I have learned so much from all of you. You have made me grow and develop. I will miss you all! 
 I have also had the greatest privilege to represent  Avega Group  at many different conferences and events around the world. It has been very rewarding and I have learned a lot. 
 Nevertheless, it is now time for me to venture into the new and exciting  King  Kingdom.

 Career kaizen 
 2011-01-292014-10-01 H√•kan Forss 7 Comments 
 It is now time for some career kaizen. As of this coming week I will start working for the Technology group within the  Avega Group  as an Agile Coach and systems architect. 
 It has not been an easy decision but it has been in the making for some time. 
 Forefront Consulting Group  as a company has great potential. The idea of really connecting the dots for a company between solid business models, thru enterprise architecture and systems architecture, to IT systems is something I believe in. If you can realize this then I believe it can have a great impact on company‚Äôs business agility and profitability. The focus on a process oriented and service oriented approach to model and structure a company is something I strongly believe in. And last, but in no way the least, applying a structured business transformation methodology to make the changes really happened and stick. These ideas really resonate with my passion in agile and lean. 
 So why am I leaving a company that have all the right ideas? 
 
 I see  Forefront Consulting Group  starting to swim in a  blue ocean  of enterprise architecture, process modeling, systems architecture and also some business transformation. This is great and I see a great consulting company in the making. 
 For myself, I want to swim in another part of the same ocean where all this is tied together with the lean and agile mindset of a continuous improvements and an emergent architecture. Until I find this part of the ocean I will pursue my passion for lean and agile. 
 At  Avega  I will participate in the development of the agile mentorship concept. I will do coaching of teams and organizations that are just to begin or are already on their lean or agile journey. I will try to do more public speaking at conferences and local agile and lean networks. I will also try to blog more often. I will continue working on practices and tools like  Visual WIP . Let the next career kaizen event begin,  Avgea  here I come!
