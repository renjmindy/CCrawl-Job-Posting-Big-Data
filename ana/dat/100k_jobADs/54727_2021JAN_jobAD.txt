 Job: Director of Library Services 
 Posted on  December 11, 2013  by   sarahgprescott 
 12/9/13 -  Director of Library Services 
College of the Marshall Islands, Majuro, Atoll 
 Sarah P 's comments : If you want to live 'out there' this is the place to go. They hang a sign up at the grocery store when fresh vegetables arrive and the ATM sometimes runs out of money before the weekend is over. It is crazy and funky and the College is always struggling to keep afloat but somehow manages to keep going. It is interesting to note that there are two positions being advertised which is a new development - maybe there is finally some funding for the library.
