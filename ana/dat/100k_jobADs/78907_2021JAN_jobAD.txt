 Building state of the art software for a leading quantitative fund 
 Role overview 
 One of the world's fastest growing quantitative hedge funds, that employs artificial intelligence and machine learning to help develop their investment strategies. Leaders in their fields across Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics harness the power of data science and advanced technology to fuel their success. 
 Role 
 Technology drives our business â€” it's our main competitive advantage â€” and as a result, software engineers play a pivotal role. They tackle the hardest problems through analysis, experimentation, design, and elegant implementation. 
 Software engineers at Two Sigma build what the organization needs to explore data's possibilities and act on our findings â€“ to mine the past and attempt to predict the future. We create the tools at scale to enable vast data analysis; the technology we build enables us to engage in conversation with the data, and search for knowledge and insight. 
 We champion a disciplined, collaborative, scientific approach which allows us to meet the immediate needs of the business, while innovating in a way that is constantly forward-looking and future-reaching. 
 We attract engineers with a true passion for data. We seek individuals who want to build for today and invent for tomorrow. We value curiosity and insight, balanced with pragmatism and practicality. We recognize both the small steps, as well as the broad vision. 
 Our challenges require mastery of areas such as, but not limited to: 
 Kernel level development; Machine learning; Distributed systems. 
 Requirements Include: 
 
 A strong academic record with a degree or concentration in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or a scientific discipline. 
 Experience with Java, C or comparable languages. 
 Excellent problem-solving and communication skills. 
 Experience in large-scale systems is highly desirable. 
 Exceptional programming skills. 
 Strong analytical and organizational skills. 
 An obsession with building quality software. 
 We are open-minded in our search for critical thinkers who are passionate about technology. 
 While we analyze the data-rich domain of finance, financial experience is not a requirement.

 More than 1,700 people who believe the scientific method is the best way to approach investing. Ideas backed up with information. And improved by iteration. Thatâ€™s Two Sigma. Weâ€™re not your typical investment manager. We follow principles of technology and innovation as much as principles of investment management. Fields like machine learning and distributed computing guide us. Since 2001, weâ€™ve searched for ways that these kinds of technologies can make us better at what we do. We never stop researching and developing. In the process, we work to help real people. Through our investors, we support the retirements of millions around the world. And we help fund breakthrough research, education and a wide range of charities and foundations.
