 WorkSourceWA.com takes measures to protect users from misinformation and internet fraud. However, all users are reminded that fraudulent job activities can appear on this and other websites and may appear to be legitimate job opportunities. Be wary of online business opportunities, work-at-home promises, and sites or postings that request personal information. Please keep in mind that most employers will conduct a personal face-to-face interview prior to offering an employment opportunity. Identity theft is a significant and potentially costly problem, and internet users should never provide their Social Security numbers, birth dates, credit card numbers, checking account information or other private information when responding to job opportunities online. 
 This website administrator has made every attempt to reduce inappropriate job postings, but users should be cautious and use their best judgment. WorkSourceWA.com recommends conducting additional research to learn more about an employer before applying for a job. Nothing contained in or available via this website shall constitute an affiliation, sponsorship or endorsement by the State of Washington, partner agencies or the hosting site of any employers using the site, or of the respective products and services they may buy, sell or otherwise provide.
