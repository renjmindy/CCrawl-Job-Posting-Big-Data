 Introduction 
 This bulletin board  supplements  the  Employment and Entrepreneurship  page (which also lists other websites designed for veterans in mind). 
 LVMAC recognizes having a job is typically the "number one" concern of a transitioning or mid-life veteran -- and good jobs are hard to come by. From time to time, we receive notification of available job offerings through various networks. Below is a crude, rudimentary and occasionally updated listing of job opportunities. Most are probably in the DLI job search database at the Lehigh Valley CareerLink, but the possibility also exists some employers may prefer not to use that means of referral. 
 For the record, we do not work for or have an obligation to any employer. 
 Our Criteria and Conditions: 
 
 We will emphasize those listings where veterans are actively sought for well-paying jobs which can support a family. Therefore we do not solicit job offers not made with that aim in mind. 
 We prefer the jobs be located within the Lehigh Valley. However, we know good jobs are currently scarce and therefore will post some jobs farther out. 
 We will post internship/paid training programs when we know of them. These are particularly helpful to the transitioning some veterans back to civilian work life. 
 We cannot assure a job listed will be available when a veteran calls the employer. We are not a job agency. We are an all- volunteer organization trying to help others. 
 We will not assure an employer is a good one. We will endorse no business or government agency. However, to the best of our ability, we will not list jobs requiring additional subsidy from taxpayers to assure a decent living wage. 
 Job seekers are not to contact us directly about the jobs listed unless to correct an error. This can be done through  info@lvmac.org .

 Five VA hospital networks in the Veterans Health Administration exist within about 60 miles of the Lehigh Valley, without considering the Philadelphia VA Regional Office (Veterans Benefits Administration) and the Washington Crossing Cemetery (National Cemetery Administration).

While it, like other federal agencies, uses  USAJOBS  (the federal government's official web portal for hiring) as a portal, it has established a Veteran Employment Program Office (VEPO), which has a one stop website for veterans seeking employment:  click here . The website explains veterans‘ preference, has a contact email addresses to answer any questions, and has a converter tool that helps transitioning service members find appropriate jobs to apply for within DHS and the federal government. Any veterans interested in employment at DHS should send their inquiries to  VETS@DHS.GOV  or call  202-357-8620 . [Accessed 18 July 2015]

However, the VRE maintains a website under its VetSuccess program which has more general applicability for all veterans and pays attention to connecting both the veteran and the employer to each other, whether federal or private.  Click here  for the one-stop VA job hunting site of  multiple  sites it offers on employment. [Accessed 18 July 2015]
