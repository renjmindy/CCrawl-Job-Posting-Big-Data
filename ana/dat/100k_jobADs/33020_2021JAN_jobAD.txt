 NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK JOBS 
 WHAT IS THE NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK (NBN)? 
 The National Broadband Network (NBN) is a next-generation broadband network designed for Australia’s future needs. It will provide faster, more reliable broadband access to all Australian homes and businesses through a mix of three technologies: optic fibre, fixed wireless and next-generation satellite. 
 Worth an estimated $37.4 billion, the NBN is also the biggest telecommunications reform in Australia’s history and means fairer infrastructure access for service providers, greater retail competition and more choice with services for families and businesses. It is expected to deliver 25,000 jobs to the Australian market over 7 years with completion scheduled for 2020. 
 WorkPac is proud to partner with our clients to present some exciting opportunities to be a part of this landmark project. We are now recruiting for a number of roles to support the NBN rollout.
