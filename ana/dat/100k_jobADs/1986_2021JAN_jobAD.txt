 Normal Gets You Nowhere 
 Posted on  February 4, 2020February 2, 2020 Categories Book Reviews ,  Careers Tags finding and succeeding at a job ,  kelly cutrone ,  normal gets you nowhere Leave a comment on Normal Gets You Nowhere 
 Years ago I picked up for free a copy of the Kelly Cutrone life-and-career guide  Normal Gets You Nowhere . 
 The author is Sicilian like I am and works in the fashion industry. 
 Her book title should be taken to heart as a truism. 
 The definition of normal is: 
 "Of or having ordinary or average intelligence; conforming to a standard or type; free of mental defect." 
 Does being ordinary or average sound appealing? 
 One of my mantras is: Be innovative. Not a copycat. 
 My contention is that you won't get very far in this lifetime trying to change yourself to fit into a mold of what other people think is acceptable. 
 Doing this you'll make yourself ill. 
 It's the foolproof route to a doomed career trajectory to have to work at job where you must act false to yourself every day. 
 Dare to be unusual in your method for achieving fulfillment, which will lead to your inimitable version of success. 
 Enjoy your quirkiness. What makes you different gives you an advantage. 
 Finding and succeeding at having a job you love is possible. 
 I have had this kind of career for over 19 years. 
 In the next blog entry I'll talk about the number-one book I've read that got me thinking about doing what you love on a job.
