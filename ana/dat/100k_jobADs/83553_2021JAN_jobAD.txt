 8,735 Green Jobs In The US 
 Posted on  December 17, 2010  by  stevengoddard 
 Web site 5milliongreenjobs.org lists 8,735 available jobs. They are only 4,991,265 green jobs away from their goal! 
 http://www.5milliongreenjobs.org/jobs/ 
 That is one green job for every 1,729 unemployed people in the US. Exciting stuff! No wonder Obama wants to destroy the economy further to prop up this imaginary industry.

 2000 page Omnibus spending bill defeated tonight! McConnell has suggested a 1 page spending bill in its place. Helluva job by McConnell, DeMint, and McCain.

 Give it 10 years and come back to reassess. I recall it being a 10 yr promise. Not 2 years.

 I need somebody to mow my lawn. So, that is one more green job. I will pay $10 per mow, once a week. Don't everybody show up at once to make application now….

 How about the people who troll skeptical blogs? Steve is keeping at least five employed on his own.

 Take a look at the number of jobs added at CARB, EPA, and similar government agencies, and then look at the salaries for these employees, and you will understand who is behind the scam.

 So if the average government employee makes twice the average non-government employee, and President Obama froze their wages, which was supposed to look like a conservative move to make (I guess), wouldn't it have been more impressive if he cut, instead of freezing, government employee wages by 60% so they make less than the non-government employee? And how about if green jobs paid minimum wage--would those jobs be attractive?

 As Spain has discovered for every 2 "green jobs" created 3 real jobs are lost so we should be glad the green job count remains low.
