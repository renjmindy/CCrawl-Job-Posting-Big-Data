 Are you looking to disrupt the primary healthcare system, are you willing to dive in deep and transform the relationship between patients and medical care staff, and create a healthcare solution for the people, by the people. 
 We are a group of experienced Entrepreneurs and are looking for a co-founder to join our mission. You must have an entrepreneurial spirit to help us build a next-generation primary healthcare solution, connecting people with their medical care staff. 
 We are a stealth-mode start-up, with founders having multiple exits under the belt and on a mission to team up with like-minded, mission-oriented founders. 
 We are at the solution formation stage, have generated good investor interest so far, and about to pursue funding. Huge equity and upside potential for the right candidate. 
 If you have a strong interest in healthcare and want to be part of a solution that is trusted by people/patients, this could be for you. Bonus points if you are from the primary healthcare, NHS, consumer start-up arena, and have an entrepreneurial mentality. 
 Desired Skills and Qualifications: 
 
 Expert-level experience to be a master of all trades and help build the offering as a proof of concept MVP initially. 
 Growth and Marketing Guru 
 You think of yourself as a DaVinci-type of character and love to build/create things - remember DaVinci was a builder, inventor, and an artist 
 Natural learning ability and curiosity to often ask "What if we….?" 
 You can be a doctor, dentist, aesthetic professional with a proven startup mentality 
 Knowledge of healthcare  and primary care system is helpful 
 Excitement about eventually building a team from scratch (Kind of like picking your own football fantasy league players or X-Men assault team) 
 Previous start-up experience helpful 
 
 Come, be part of the winning team to transform the primary healthcare industry
