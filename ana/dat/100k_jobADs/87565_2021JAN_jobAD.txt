  How To Conquer The 3 Myths Blocking You From Your Dream Job  
 Ryan Niessen 
 November 04, 2016 
 I made an interesting discovery recently that has the power to  significantly change your life and career…  IF you remember to use it. It's one of those paradoxical things where you have to do the opposite of what you instinctively  want  to do in order to get the result you desire.

 See, most of us are programmed to simply work harder when we want something really badly (like our dream job)... But here's the thing: When we feel stuck or frustrated because we're doing everything we can to achieve our goal, but we just can't seem to make it happen… The truth about what's happening is that we're holding onto a belief. It's either a “lie" that we were told works (and it actually doesn't). OR it's a belief about why we can't get it. Either way, the solution is simple: Identify it, and let it go. Sounds simple…but it's much harder in practice. Fortunately, awareness is the most difficult part. So in this article, I'm going to share with you the three biggest myths holding you back from getting your dream job, and how to conquer them. Let's dive right in with: 
 Myth #1: I Can't Do It... 
 I'm going to cut to the chase here because I'm pretty passionate about this one… Lack of confidence and belief in ourselves is the most damaging and prolific sickness in the world. Every single person, including myself, suffers from it and it literally ruins our lives and holds the world back. Do you know that it took me at least three years longer than it should have to start my first business? Why? Because I was a coward. I thought I needed more education, more experience BEFORE I could succeed at what I really wanted… So I would research people, and watch videos, and tell people that one day I was going to follow my passions and do what I loved. And I wish I had someone there to slap me in the face and tell me: “Ryan, this is B.S. You need to stop giving into that fear..." You need to just start. Start somewhere, anywhere. Imagine that you've already achieved your goals - and that a future you is looking back at you telling you “there's nothing you need to worry about. It's going to take you three tries before you breakthrough and get it right, but you'll get there. The sooner you start, the sooner you'll arrive". More and more companies like Google are announcing that they don't even look at grades anymore. They care about who you are and the value you can provide. So whatever your experience or education level - NOW, more than ever is your time to shine. Don't let this myth hold you back. 
 Myth #2: I'll Never Find My “Dream Job"... 
 Ok here's the problem with this one - people think about their Dream Job as a one time occurrence that they were born to do. So they wind up falling into one of three groups. The 1st group looks at this mountain of their expectations that their dream job should be - and it's soooo big and terrifying that they say “Too big. Can't do it". The 2nd group climbs half the mountain and finds a nice little lake with a cozy cabin waiting there for them. So they make basecamp, build a fire, and settle in... no matter how nasty the weather gets… and they forget about what's waiting for them at the top. The 3rd group climbs the mountain, sees that there's a range of more mountains in front of them, and says “this is AWESOME! I wonder what else I can achieve..." Make the choice NOW to be a part of that 3rd group on your journey to find your dream job. Because it truly is about the journey, and not the destination. I believe that we're put here to grow and evolve into the best person that we can be. And that's what this journey is about - you just have to get started, and keep making progress. 
 Myth #3: Traditional Job Seeking Strategies Still Work 
 Ok so here's the deal: only 1% of traditional resumes lead to a job offer. And 70% or more of people are disengaged and bored out of their minds at work… So clearly the old school approach just doesn't work. If you want to get the attention of an amazing company and get your dream job, then you've gotta do something different. Like Einstein said, insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. We can't keep following the outdated job seeking approaches they teach in school because they've been proven to NOT work. So if you'd like a little help with using modern job seeking strategies to get the attention of an amazing company and land your dream job..... Then feel free to head over here and watch the free video I put together alongside the founder of the GameChangers 500 (list of the world's top For Benefit companies; renowned for empowering & engaging their employees). He's my friend and business partner, and the strategies we share in this video are the same ones that helped me get my dream job years ago.  This post was originally published at an earlier date.
