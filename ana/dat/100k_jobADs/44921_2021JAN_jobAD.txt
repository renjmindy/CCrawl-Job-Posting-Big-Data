 What do clients say about working with you? 
 
 
 “I was at a real loss as to what I wanted to do with my life because I did not think that my life’s dream was compatible with the American marketplace. I thought that I would have to find a “runner-up” career instead, or pursue my deepest joy merely on a part-time, volunteer level. But thanks to you and the confidence you gave me, I was able to realize that I could make it happen! Over the past year, that is exactly what I’ve been doing, and I have enjoyed every day of this journey.”  College Professor 
 
 
 “During the early period of my transition, I was going it alone. I made the decision during this challenging job market that my search needed a jump start. I felt Marilyn was the best person to turn to as my personal career coach. She has a very focused approach, using different techniques to gain an understanding of the job seekers’ strengths and weaknesses, as well as their target positions. Using this analysis, she then zeros in as she finds the best way to describe those strengths and targets positions for networking contacts and potential employers. Together, we created a marketing strategy, enhanced my résumé, developed a more effective and versatile ‘elevator speech’ as well as a business card. When opportunities came, she helped prepare me for the interviews. Marilyn was always available for supportive consultation, comments and advice. She is now part of my professional support team. I’ve recommended her without hesitation to several friends and fellow job seekers.”  Executive 
 
 
 “My transition into the finance industry began a new world of professional opportunities, and I have Marilyn to thank. Marilyn took the time to understand my professional strengths, accomplishments, and aspirations fully. She translated that information into a powerful résumé that garnered attention for positions I never knew were possible. My phone rang multiple times. Marilyn’s assistance did not stop with just my résumé; she coached me on interviewing and job negotiations. I felt as if I had a partner with me each step of the way. Marilyn is now a critical component to my professional support team—when I’m ready to begin new challenges, she will be the first person I call.”  COO/Consultant/Trainer 
 
 
 “She helped me first focus on what skills/knowledge I wanted to use, where I could use these, and with what kind of organizational culture. Marilyn not only helped me search out sources, recalibrate my résumé and cover letter, but also served as the consummate cheerleader. I could not have found the ideal job without Marilyn’s expert advice and counsel and the emotional support she offered during the most trying of times, in the most trying of economies.”  Senior V.P. of Human Resources 
 
 
 “She’s outstanding!” She helped me navigate from “soup-to-nuts,” including self-assessment, networking strategies, formal/informal research, job offer, debrief, etc. I highly recommend her. She’s a valuable resource.”  CEO 
 
 
 “You taught me the value of getting out there, truly networking. I don’t think I would have had any offers at all if I relied only on the Internet. Thank you!  Project Manager
