 In this post, I am giving you a lot of ideas with this list of 35 best high-paying jobs without a degree, if you are still getting it or you never did because life took you in other directions.

 Further, these jobs can be termed as no experience high paying duties in the sense that you only need to have the passion and personal creativity.

 What are some of the best jobs/business ideas to earn money from? 
 Letâ€™s have a look at them in the following list: 
 1. Start An Online Store Business 
 When you invest correctly in an  online store business,  you will have all that you ever dreamt of. With this business, a good return is guaranteed when you have high steady traffic. To start this business, you will need: 
 
 Coaching 
 An eCommerce Platform like  Shopify 
 Your products 
 Others products 
 
 Through blogging, eCommerce, or even social media, you can promote and sell anything from your store, whether itâ€™s physical products, digital products, or SaaS. 
 2. Become a CSR 
 Becoming a CSR (Contract Customer Service) is another excellent job opportunity with high pay and doesnâ€™t require any bachelor. Nowadays, many companies and organizations have opted to CSR to reduce their budget allocation on certain services. 
 It is a great offer, especially if you have excellent communication skills as well as management for this job. You can opt for  Fiverr ,  UpWork , and Flexjobs, among other websites that offer CSR jobs, or you can publish your services. 
 Fiver Is The #1 Marketplace for all services. Create a seller account and place your offers. 
 3. Buy a Website 
 Do you have some money and want to invest in a business that you can run from home? 
 A website is an excellent option if you have a business plan in mind. With it, you can tap into the potential online marketplace with millions of active users. 
 Buying a new website is an excellent option if you lack the professional skills of creating a striking and unique performing website. With a website, you can generate an audience and steady traffic to sell your products/ services. 
 You need to check and make sure that the website you are going to buy is priced according to its traffic, yearly revenue, expenses and other metrics. 
 Flippa  is the top marketplace for websites for sale, with thousands of offers. 
 4. Content Marketing 
 Freelance marketing, one or another, you must have heard of this before. Many small scale businesses, startups, and even influencers are always in a constant rush to boost their traffic. 
 So, if you have the best skills in content marketing, itâ€™s about time you earn money out of it. 
 Thus, the moment you manage to create a platform that is well established with a professional network, you stand to earn a good ticket from every single project. 
 Again,  Fiverr  is my recommendation where to start without hassles.

 5. Ghostwriter 
 As a ghostwriter donâ€™t expect any credit from your work no matter how great it is. However, you will be earning a good amount of money for your writing passion. 
 For instance,  Jeff Hadden  has earned millions through this job among other successful ghostwriters. 
 So if you have great writing skills and passion consider finding gigs on freelancing platforms like UpWork, Fiver, and  HireWriters  among others, and make a good income out of it. 
 6. Virtual Assistant 
 For those with exceptional organization skills, this is a great place to exercise and earn an income in the process. There are growing demands for virtual assistants by corporate, businesses, and freelancers. And this is intending to reduce the budget they will spend on actual assistance. 
 Itâ€™s also great to opt for this job as you will meet with influential and successful people from various fields. Further, it allows you to be flexible and work from anywhere in the world. Lastly, you can use this opportunity to create an extensive network of professionals. 
 7. Affiliate Marketer 
 There has been a steady buzz in the online market for quite sometimes. And if you ask anyone about the means to make quick money, many people consider affiliate marketing a stand-out option. 
 Although there is a need of hard work and dedication, through the right strategies you can generate passive income for life in a relatively short period of time. 
 You will find many brands and businesses that target to build awareness on products and services they are offering, pointing towards the use of affiliates. As an affiliate, you can earn a living through commissions by promoting merchantsâ€™ products or services. 
 According to studies, many bloggers generate $7.5K to $25K monthly. But thatâ€™s not all; almost 40% of that income comes from affiliate marketing. 
 Here you have a list of the best  Affiliate Marketing Networks  and the top  High-Pay Affiliate Programs  you can join. 
 If you want to start an online business online with very low risk, you can choose a platform where you can get the necessary mentoring, tools, and resources. 
 Here is my recommendation. 
 8. Social Media Influence 
 As social media channels keep on increasing with an increase in the number of users as well, this has created a potential job for influencers. Many consumers are now relying on influencers to identify the best products and services to opt for. Therefore, if you can gather an incredible number of followers, this might be the perfect job for you. 
 You can consider online tutorials and tools to guide you on how to become an Influencer; after that, build a steady following, and you will be in business within no time. A great social media platform for this service includes Facebook and Instagram, among others. Further, consider guides on how to make money on the various social media platform. 
 9. Freelancer 
 Freelancer is a great job option that pays not only well but also very convenient. With this option, you can work in the comfort of your home without worrying about job reporting time. Further, it requires little or no investment to start compared to other jobs that require bachelor but still pay well. 
 To begin with, you have to be conversant with online platforms. You can either decide to work as a freelance writer on platforms like Fiverr, UpWork, or  Flexjobs , among others. Alternatively, you can choose Freelance Marketing and work through affiliate programs or on freelance platforms like FlexJobs. 
 Or any skill that you can showcase and perform, for the matter. 
 10. Start a Niche Blog 
 Have you ever thought of starting a blog? Well, itâ€™s about time that you do, especially if you are looking for a high paying business without a degree. Launching a blog can be quite demanding at first, especially when it comes to time and resources to make it successful. 
 But considering the great reward, you will be reaping after attaining a better SERP rank, significant following, and constant traffic flow in your site. Itâ€™s worth it. Through the blog, you can earn as an affiliate marketer, service provider, or perhaps through selling your products. 
 Therefore, take the first step to success and earning good money through blogging. You can seek advice from experts or through guides on how to start a blog and make it successful. 
 11. Web Development 
 Internet users are more than  4 billion ; therefore, for an online business to cover this whole population, six out of ten small scale businesses have their websites. As a result, there is a constant demand for these websites by companies as well as individuals. 
 And this is why Web development is a lucrative business with steady customers. All you need is excellent skills in web development as well as upgrades. To nurture your skills, consider working on your friends or family websites. 
 If you donâ€™t have the skills but want to acquire them there are thousands of courses online, paid, and free to learn Web Development. 
 Try  Fiverr Learn  or  Udemy  to start with at a low cost. 
 12. App development 
 If you check in your phone app store, you will find an App for almost everything. And this is whether itâ€™s an app for organizing your schedule, food cooking guide, or perhaps an app to balance your finances. Many of these apps are making thousands and millions, if not billions annually. 
 And thatâ€™s not all, with App development, you donâ€™t need coding skills, with the right tools, itâ€™s as easy as you can think of it. But before, opting for a particular app ensures youâ€™ve done thorough market research and identified a potential gap in peopleâ€™s needs. 
 13. Travel Consultant 
 If you have a passion for traveling, well, you can make good use of that energy in being a travel consultant. However, you need to possess skills like being updated in hotel deals, train tickets, and airline ticket options. 
 To test your skills, why not try this job through your family and friends. You can start by securing the tickets and the best hotel deals in the destination they intend to go to. Whatâ€™s more, you need to exercise your marketing skills in various platforms, whether through social media or websites. 
 Lastly, you can create collaborations with travel agencies once you are well established. It will enable you to negotiate better deals for your clients. 
 14. Graphic designer 
 The graphic designer is yet another lucrative opportunity to earn good money. Many companies and businesses are often in a constant search to get the best designers in the market. In this case, you can specialize in areas like branding, banner designing, logos, posters, marketing collaterals, and even stunning designs of land pages. 
 Consider individuals and small businesses as a point to kick start your business. Further, there are freelance websites with reasonable offers to deliver your services as well. 
 To boost your skills further, consider online graphic courses. Alternatively, there are useful guides to learn this skill for free or at an affordable cost. Lastly, consider visual tools to boost your skills further.
