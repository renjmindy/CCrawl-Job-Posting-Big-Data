 Job 6-9; Psalms 11-12 
 Assigned Reading for January 5: Job 6-9; Psalms 11-12 
 Psalms - 
 Chapter 11 -  Refuge. God is the One we have to run toward.  While the wicked pull out weaponry, they are no match for God. He is full of justice. 
 Chapter 12 -  Where are the loyal?  Perhaps, a question many of us have asked. Even though people lie and deceive, God is the One who made their lips and hearts. God's words, thankfully, are flawless and He will protect us. 
 Job - 
 Bildad, Job's friend, offers some wisdom. Even though it is wisdom, it doesn't apply to the situation Job is facing. In these chapters, we come to realize one truth. 
 
 Job is really struggling, and his friends aren't offering much consolation. 
 
 I mean, Job is absolutely miserable. Depressed, insomnia, pain, the loss of his children and possibly left by his wife. He is honestly struggling. Yet, his friends aren't offering him the comfort. He needed that comfort more than anything. One verse stood out to me, tonight, as I read through chs. 6-9. 
 
 "If only there were someone to mediate between us [Job and God], someone to bring us together…(Job 9:33)" 
 
 Thank God, there is a Mediator for us today. His name is Jesus Christ! 
 
 "For there is only one God and one Mediator who can reconcile God and humanity-the man Christ Jesus (1 Timothy 2:5)."
