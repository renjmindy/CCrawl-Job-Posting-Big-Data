 THE ROLE 
The Research Associates/Assistants will conduct data analysis to determine trends in the health of Singapore’s coastal and marine environment and the ecosystem services it provides. This will involve the compilation of several existing temporal and spatial datasets, and modelling of coastal ecosystem services using software such as R and/or ArcGIS.

 S/he will have knowledge of tropical coastal ecosystems and the ecosystem services concept, and will have strong quantitative analysis skills. S/he will work closely with project staff, as well as the PIs to ensure the requirements of the project work plan are met. 
 Job responsibilities:

 Report to and work with the principal investigator and assigned project staff 
 Any other ad-hoc duties as assigned by the principal investigator

 ABOUT THE RESEARCH PROJECT 
The overall aim of the project is to quantify the economic, social, and cultural value of Singapore’s environmental assets (its ‘Natural Capital’), and present and model the information in such a way that it can inform future policy and urban development. To protect and enhance natural capital in Singapore and secure the long-term foundational benefits from this capital, we need to understand the current status of Singapore’s ecosystems, and develop tools to predict the environmental impacts of future urbanization. This will be achieved by: 1. quantifying the current status of Singapore’s terrestrial and coastal-marine ecosystems 2. quantifying the value of Singapore’s terrestrial and coastal/marine ecosystems to Society. 3. assessing tradeoffs between urban development (urban assets) and natural capital (natural assets) 4. assessing future policy and development opportunities that integrate natural capital
