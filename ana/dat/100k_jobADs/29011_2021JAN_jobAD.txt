 Software Architecture as Business Analysis 
 June 6, 2018 
 Kevin Sookocheff 
 "Architecture is the bridge between (often abstract) business goals and the final, concrete resulting system." 
 – Software Architecture in Practice, Third Edition 
 A software architect should act as a bridge between business stakeholders and technical stakeholders. This requires understanding the business problem being solved and the ability to distill that problem into a technical solution that a software team can implement. The bridge can often be built using the methods of business analysis. 
 The role of a business analyst is to define the needs of an organization and recommend solutions that deliver value to stakeholders. A software architect can do the same thing—but an architect’s responsibility may be more technical, and stakeholders can include project managers, software developers, management, and other software architects. 
 This article describes how a software architect can apply methods from business analysis to build a bridge between business and technical stakeholders, which in turn, will help the entire organization easily cross some treacherous terrain. 
 Key responsibilities 
 The key responsibilities of a business analyst are the discovery of underlying business needs, specifying and organizing requirements, and validating that requirements are being met. Depending on the role, a professional business analyst may be involved in project management and business planning. In most organizations, these responsibilities are similar to those of a software architect, and the software architect can apply business analysis techniques to help move projects forward while keeping all stakeholders informed in language they feel most comfortable with. 
 The business analysis process 
 Business analysis is primarily a research discipline of identifying business needs and determining solutions to business problems. As a research discipline, several techniques have been developed to aid business analysts in doing their jobs. By following these techniques as an architect, you can take advantage of a clear method for engaging and communicating with business stakeholders and clearly communicate the value you are providing to the organization by taking on this role. 
 One technique for managing the analysis process that applies to the architecture process is the  8-step business analysis process . In the rest of this article, I will walk through that process with a particular emphasis on the issues faced by software architects. 
 Step 1: Get oriented 
 When starting a new project—or helping to define the architecture for an existing one—a strong tendency is to start making positive change as soon as possible. This is often coupled with the feeling that we need to prove ourselves to our stakeholders. By acting too quickly, we act without a full understanding of the business problem and without a full understanding of existing assumptions. This can easily lead to false starts in the wrong direction. 
 Instead, take some time to get oriented with the project and stakeholders, so can ensure you are an effective and confident contributor on the project. 
 Key responsibilities of step 1: 
 
 Determine the primary stakeholders to engage in defining the project’s architectural requirements and scope 
 Clarify your role as the architect and making sure other stakeholders understand that role 
 Understand the project history, so you do not inadvertently repeat work that has already been done or rehash previously made decisions 
 Identify the existing systems and business processes, so you have a clear understanding of the current state 
 
 Step 2: Discover the business goal 
 An architecture is not valuable unless it solves a business problem. As an architect, it is your job to help define the business objectives in conjunction with project managers, engineering leads, and even executives. It is tempting to assume that managers and leads can simply hand the business goal to an architect and that the architect can focus solely on the technical implementation, but avoid this temptation. 
 In reality, product managers often lack the technical understanding of the project to correctly define the business goal in implementable terms. As an architect, your job is to help define the business goal in language that both a product manager and a software engineer can understand. This process should be a negotiation between the business goals and the current architectural and technical constraints of your system. 
 Key responsibilities of step 2: 
 
 Discover why this project exists: What is the business goal? 
 Reconcile conflicting expectations, so the business community and technical community begin the project with a shared understanding 
 Ensure the business objectives are clear and actionable 
 
 Step 3: Limit scope 
 A project’s architecture has clear implications on a project’s timeline and scope. By providing a clear and complete statement of scope, the development team can move forward, and business stakeholders have a common set of expectations. In addition, define the boundaries between the project and other systems, and identify the integration points and responsibilities. 
 Key responsibilities of step 3: 
 
 Clarify scope with both business and technology stakeholders 
 Confirm the business case can be met with as limited scope as possible, ensuring that it still makes sense for your organization to invest in the project 
 
 Step 4: Formulate a plan 
 At this point, you can start to formulate an architectural plan that satisfies the scope of the project. This plan will help you to clarify the project itself and detail any necessary requirements. 
 Key responsibilities of step 4: 
 
 Determine a rough architectural plan 
 Choose the most appropriate types of deliverables for your work: diagrams, text, presentations, etc. 
 Identify any project timelines for completing the work 
 
 Step 5: Detail any requirements 
 Detailed requirements should help the technology team implement the solution. The requirements help turn an abstract business goal into an implementable solution. 
 Remember that software engineering class from university that talked about the requirements-gathering process? Unfortunately, you may have to relive that long forgotten past and review that material. The business may not know what requirements the software team cares about, and it definitely will not know how to write requirements that a technical team can take action on. This stage is one of the most important of architecture—when you become the bridge between the business goals and the technical implementation. 
 Key responsibilities of step 5: 
 
 Help business stakeholders define their explicit requirements 
 Analyze requirements to make sure they are technically sound and implementable 
 Review and validate each requirement with the technology team, and ask questions to fill in gaps 
 
 Step 6: Support the technical implementation 
 As an architect, you are technically capable of helping with the implementation. This help may take the form of coding, prototyping, or reviewing code. It may also take the form of being a sounding board for the team to bounce ideas off of. Your support role may change depending on the qualities of the team you are working with. Some teams may need more hands-on technical support, while other teams are able to act independently on technical issues but need more guidance when interacting with business stakeholders. Use your judgment and experience to fill in any gaps. 
 Key responsibilities of step 6: 
 
 Review the design to make sure it meets the business and architectural goals 
 Update and/or repackage documentation to make it useful for the technology design and implementation process 
 Engage test teams to make sure they are able to test the project against the requirements 
 Make yourself available to answer questions, and help resolve any issues that surface during the technical design, technical implementation, or testing phases of the project 
 
 Step 7: Support the business implementation 
 The business also has to deploy, market, and support the system. To do that, they need to understand what you are building and how it affects the organization. At this step in the process, you may need to engage stakeholders and explain the new solution to them, making sure they understand how it works and why. Share their feedback with the team for improvement. 
 Key responsibilities of step 7: 
 
 Talk with end users to ensure they understand the new system, including any limits or restrictions 
 Collaborate with business users to understand any business impact of adopting the new technical solution 
 Plan for how the business can adopt the solution or transition to it 
 
 Step 8: Evaluate the solution 
 During development of a new project, it is easy to lose sight of the original purpose. Although this step is listed last, validating that the solution meets the requirements of the business should be happening at all times throughout the development of the project. Nearing the end of the project, I usually work more closely with quality assurance to help define the testing and validation requirements and to make sure that they meet the project’s needs. 
 Key responsibilities of step 8: 
 
 Evaluate the actual project against the business objectives for the project 
 Communicate the project’s results to the business 
 Suggest follow-up projects and initiatives to fully realize the intended business objectives of the project or to solve new problems 
 
 It’s a process! 
 Although I listed eight sequential steps in this article, you may be doing the steps in any order, skipping some completely, or doing some of them at the same time—it is simply unrealistic to expect one process to fit all use cases and all projects. Be flexible, be understanding, and work with what you have. Business is messy, architecture is messy, and connecting the two can be outright chaos. But, someone has to build that bridge—maybe that person is you.
