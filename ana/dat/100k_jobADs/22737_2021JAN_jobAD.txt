Colegio Franklin D. Roosevelt, Lima, Peru 
 Sarah P 's comments : CFR is one of the most established international schools in South America. They pay is not high in South America but the cultural experience is fantastic. A new Head of Library was hired last year and this year they have two positions listed, one for elementary and one for EC.
