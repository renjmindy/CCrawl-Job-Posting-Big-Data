 Brooklyn On The Job Injury Attorney 
 If you’ve sustained an injury while working, it might be time to hire a Brooklyn on the job injury attorney. Injuries sustained from work can be very damaging: not only can these injuries cause a great deal of pain, but they can also derail your financial security. Workers’ compensation laws aim to protect individuals who have been injured or developed an illness due to their profession, but it would be remiss to say that all workers’ comp programs function flawlessly. 
 At Polsky, Shouldice & Rosen, P.C., we recognize the importance of workers’ compensation plans, but we also recognize that these plans sometimes operate to the disadvantage of claimants. Even when workers’ comp regulations are intended to offer protection, individuals with valid injuries may find it difficult to collect the payments that they deserve. We believe that every injured worker should have the opportunity to speak with a Brooklyn on the job injury attorney if they believe that they are being denied a rightful settlement. 
 Collecting Workers’ Compensation 
 There are several requirements that an individual must meet before he/she is allowed to collect compensation. Claims must be filed with the applicable workers’ compensation board for review. In order to be considered for workers’ compensation: 
 
 The employer must be covered under a workers’ compensation policy 
 The injured claimant must be an employee of the employer that owns that policy 
 The employee must have sustained an injury or developed an illness directly because of a job-related task 
 
 An important facet of workers’ compensation is that liability  is not an issue . Regardless of who was technically liable for causing the accident at work, a valid claim might still be approved. Each person’s claim will likely involve many unique factors. Talking to a Brooklyn on the job injury attorney is one way of determining whether or not your situation would likely qualify for workers’ compensation coverage. 
 Dealing With a Dispute or a Denial 
 It’s not uncommon for claimants to have problems collecting compensation after a work-related injury. In some cases, the employer disputes that the injury occurred at work or argues that another party is technically liable. Claims might also be denied by the company that provides the workers compensation policy. Claims might be denied due to insufficient documentation, missed deadlines, or a lack of evidence about the injury. 
 If you’re dealing with one of these problems, it may be beneficial to contact an on the job injury attorney in Brooklyn. An experienced attorney may provide legal counsel and act as your representative in legal proceedings.
