 Salary: 
 Open 
 Berkeley Lab's  Material Sciences Division  has a new opening for a EUV Interferometry Project Scientist. This role will work on an external contract from KLA to design and develop an EUV wavefront sensor based on Lateral Shearing Interferometry (LSI) to test the alignment of their mask inspection tool. The Scientist will serve as the primary point of contact between KLA and the Center for X-ray Optics (CXRO) for this project, and will work with scientific staff at both KLA and at CXRO on the design and deployment of the sensor. 
 What You Will Do: 
 
 
 Design and build simulation software to study the interferometer and carry out an analysis of systematic errors in the system. 
 
 
 Design and model the optical geometry of the system, including preliminary null tests and the setup for the production tool. 
 
 
 Develop instrument control software for operating the experiments. 
 
 
 Travel on-site to KLA to help set up, run, and analyze data for the experiments. Attend and present in weekly meetings with KLA scientific and engineering personnel. 
 
 
 What is Required: 
 
 
 PhD in Optics, Optical Engineering, or a related field, or an equivalent combination and education and work experience. 
 
 
 Experience working with EUV systems such as lithography or inspection tools. 
 
 
 Experience with vacuum systems. 
 
 
 Experience working in clean rooms (class 1000 and below). 
 
 
 Experience modeling EUV optical systems in Zemax or related software. 
 
 
 Experience developing and deploying software for instrument control of complex tooling. 
 
 
 Strong command of MATLAB and object-oriented programming, C programming, and MEX files. 
 
 
 Strong understanding of Fourier and Statistical Optics, in particular partially coherent imaging principles. 
 
 
 Strong understanding of linear algebra. 
 
 
 Experience with RCWA or FDTD 3D electromagnetic simulations. 
 
 
 Desired Qualifications: 
 
 
 Experience working with external vendors and sourcing equipment. 
 
 
 Experience with Lateral Shearing Interferometry preferred. 
 
 
 Understanding of software architecture: MVC patterns, software repositories (git). 
 
 
 Notes: 
 
 
 This is a full-time 1 year, term appointment that may be renewed to a maximum of five years. 
 
 
 This position may be subject to a background check. Any convictions will be evaluated to determine if they directly relate to the responsibilities and requirements of the position. Having a conviction history will not automatically disqualify an applicant from being considered for employment. 
 
 
 Work will be primarily performed at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, 1 Cyclotron Road, Berkeley, CA.

 About Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory 
 In the world of science, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) is synonymous with excellence. Thirteen scientists associated with Berkeley Lab have won the Nobel Prize. Fifty-seven Lab scientists are members of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), one of the highest honors for a scientist in the United States. Thirteen of our scientists have won the National Medal of Science, our nation's highest award for lifetime achievement in fields of scientific research. Eighteen of our engineers have been elected to the National Academy of Engineering, and three of our scientists have been elected into the Institute of Medicine. In addition, Berkeley Lab has trained thousands of university science and engineering students who are advancing technological innovations across the nation and around the world. Berkeley Lab is a member of the national laboratory system supported by the U.S. Department of Energy through its Office of Science. It is managed by the University of California (UC) and is charged with conducting unclassified research across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Located on a 200-acre site in the hills above the UC Berkeley campus that offers spectacular... views of the San Francisco Bay, Berkeley Lab employs approximately 4,200 scientists, engineers, support staff and students. Its budget for 2011 is $735 million, with an additional $101 million in funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, for a total of $836 million. A recent study estimates the Laboratory's overall economic impact through direct, indirect and induced spending on the nine counties that make up the San Francisco Bay Area to be nearly $700 million annually. The Lab was also responsible for creating 5,600 jobs locally and 12,000 nationally. The overall economic impact on the national economy is estimated at $1.6 billion a year. Technologies developed at Berkeley Lab have generated billions of dollars in revenues, and thousands of jobs. Savings as a result of Berkeley Lab developments in lighting and windows, and other energy-efficient technologies, have also been in the billions of dollars. Berkeley Lab was founded in 1931 by Ernest Orlando Lawrence, a UC Berkeley physicist who won the 1939 Nobel Prize in physics for his invention of the cyclotron, a circular particle accelerator that opened the door to high-energy physics. It was Lawrence's belief that scientific research is best done through teams of individuals with different fields of expertise, working together. His teamwork concept is a Berkeley Lab legacy that continues today.
