 New SkillSPAN Network Will Increase Skills and Job Training Opportunities for Thousands of People 
 
 New network will push for policies in postsecondary education, workforce training, career and technical education that expand economic opportunities for people and boost local businesses 
 Boston, MA - Massachusetts will be one of ten states to join the just-launched  SkillSPAN , the first nationwide network of non-partisan organizations working together to drive workforce policy wins in over twenty-five states over the next five years. 
 SkillSPAN - which stands for Skills State Policy Advocacy Network - will bring together policy organizations, workforce advocates, community colleges, businesses, unions, and others focused on advancing state policies that support workers who want training for good, family-supporting jobs and help local businesses grow a skilled workforce. 
 In Massachusetts, SkillWorks and our public policy partner, the  Workforce Solutions Group , will work with stakeholders and policy makers to implement critical systems changes and improvements. Our main goals are: 
 
 Develop a workforce and education system that supports  Career Pathways  that align the job training, economic development and higher education systems, including Adult Basic Education. 
 Increase accountability measures by adopting  common performance measures  for job training, education and employment programs ans ask the state to adopt  wage record matching  for all programs. 
 Expand successful career and vocational technical pathways  for disconnected and opportunity youth that align workforce development, secondary and post-secondary education systems, and job training and placement programs. 
 Develop evidence-based policies and programs which  support people with barriers to employment  ; including TAFDC recipients with low education levels and little or no employment history. 
 Advocate for the passage of  state and federal job creation  proposals. 
 
 " On behalf of SkillWorks and the Workforce Solutions Group, we'd like to thank the National Skills Coalition for launching SkillSPAN and for creating this opportunity for our state coalition to boost and broaden our policy development and advocacy work." 
 
 Marybeth Campbell, Executive Director, SkillWorks. 
 
 An initiative of  National Skills Coalition , SkillSPAN aims to amplify the voices of organizations like SkillWorks and the Workforce Solutions Group, and their partners in state capitals across the country in order to move workforce policies across a number of states. Some of these policies include:  making financial aid available  to working people; protecting  funding for skills training  programs; and  expanding apprenticeship  programs, particularly for low-income working adults and out-of-school youth. 
 “In every statehouse, policymakers can support training that expands economic opportunities for workers and their families,”  said Brooke DeRenzis, State Policy and Network Director at National Skills Coalition.  “SkillSPAN partners will help by equipping state leaders with innovative workforce development policies.”
