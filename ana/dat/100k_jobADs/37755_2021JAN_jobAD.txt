 Will Quitting Your Job Affect an Ongoing Workers’ Comp Case? 
 
 Posted on:  Aug 15 2020 
 By:   admin 
 
 Dealing with an injury that occurred while working can be stressful. While the  workers’ comp  process is designed to ensure that you have the funds to cover all medical costs and make certain you’re not under undue financial stress while you can’t work, it’s not a process that many people understand. It’s also a process that can become derailed if the paperwork isn’t submitted correctly or on time. Fortunately, one thing you won’t have to worry over is your employment status. 
 The Connection Between Employment and Workers’ Comp 
 If you have to leave your job due to the injuries you sustained or because you’ve decided you no longer wish to work with your employer, it won’t impact your ability to have workers’ comp pay for your medical bills. Once the case has been filed, it no longer ties you to your employer. In fact, it’s not unusual for injured employees to leave their job if their injuries were severe. 
 However, while workers’ comp will still cover your medical bills, there is a chance that you will lose the option for vocational rehabilitation. Workers comp may pay for you to go through rehab so you can return to your job. It may also pay for you to learn a new job if your injuries were so severe you can’t return to doing the work you once did. However, if you change jobs on your own, you may no longer have that option. 
 Temporary Disability Payments May Also Be Affected 
 If you’re unable to return to work, your employer will pay likely pay you temporary disability. This money is to help you make end meet until you return to work. If you quit your job, however, it’s possible your former employer could stop those payments. If you leave for a new job that pays less than what you currently make and the reason is due to your injuries, you may receive a partial disability. This area can become very murky, so it’s best you have a legal professional on your side who is very familiar with workers’ compensation laws. 
 Maximum Orthopedics  is here to help you with all of your workers’ comp paperwork and medical needs. If you need to make a claim, we can help. Contact us today to set up a meeting.
