 Hello Joburg â€¦

 So I moved back to Joburg a couple of months back and I must say I am enjoying it and if I thought I loved the city before, I love it even more now. What do I love so much about the city? 
 
 I didn't realise how much I had missed the greenery and the trees, particularly in the area I live. 
 The grime of the city and the fact that there is a beautiful imperfection. 
 The warmth of the people and their sheer diversity in terms of race, nationality, creed and all other ways. 
 My family and close friends live here. 
 Multi-lane highways that get you where you need to go faster ðŸ™‚ 
 It was so much easier to join my local library. 
 Hot summers and thunder showers.
