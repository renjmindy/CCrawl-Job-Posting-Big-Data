 Carla Williams Johnson is a Media Marketing Specialist based in Trinidad an Tobago. She founded Carli Communications, which offers advertising and marketing advice to entrepreneurs and business owners who are interested in building a business in the ‘real world’. 
 She considers herself an advocate for business men and women who were desirous of promoting themselves by offering sound, unbiased advice, focusing mainly on methods to identify ideal clients,online and offline approaches to boosting visibility and the creation of practical marketing campaigns designed to increase revenue. 
 1) How did you get started working from home? 
 I was completely tired and fed up of the 8-4 lifestyle working for people who would never actually appreciate my gifts and talents. One day I just decided I would leave my job and coincidentally that was the day they made my position redundant. I took it as a sign from God. 
 2) How did you choose the work-at-home career you do? 
 I always had a passion for helping others with their advertising and marketing. My one superpower is that I can tell you exactly what you need to do and where you need to be to make money. I have a unique creative mind, combined with my knowledge and experience in media so I always think up of out of the box ideas. 
 3) How did you get started (basic initial steps)? 
 A laptop, a phone and the internet…….that's it. I opened my company’s Facebook page and a blog site on WordPress and got to work. Eventually networked, met more persons and was referred to others. That was basically it. 
 4) How did you get your first client or customer or job? 
 I was invited to join a group of business individuals who were on the same journey as me. Through networking, sharing my knowledge and experience one of the persons in the group hired me to assist them with getting publicity and promotion for one of their clients. I was able to use my skills to get the company featured in the local press, radio and television. The company was Prestige Holdings Trinidad & Tobago Limited who handles KFC, TGI Fridays, Subway, Starbucks and Pizza Hut 
 5) How do you market your business? 
 Currently I market via social media, using each platform (Facebook,Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn) to capture a different market. I am in the process of developing my YouTube channel as well. I am also using direct marketing and trying to secure traditional media to promote myself 
 6) What does your usual day look like? 
 When I get up at 10am, I meditate to clear my mind then I get started on my ‘to do’ list that I created the night before. This list includes everything I have to do in my business and personal life. I usually take care of the personal stuff first but when it comes to working the business I am typically what people might call a ‘night owl’ because I usually get started from around 7pm until 2am. Strangely enough I get more done and I am more energized around that time 
 7) What do you know now that you wish you knew when you started? 
 Definitely meditation and journaling. It really helps when clear your mind and get every single thing out of your head and on paper. It has become a necessary part of my life. Another thing is to have an accountability partner to keep you on track. You tend to get lost in your own head and you need someone who is on the same journey as you to just talk things through with and help your get out of your own way. 
 8) What advice would you give someone who wants to work from home? 
 Give yourself a timetable and schedule everything you have to do…….and I mean EVERYTHING. Give your ‘at home’ business the same dedication you would give a job in that you start a certain time, have a break a certain time, etc. I would also say to have a steady network of persons who you can call on to help you.Do not isolate yourself just because you are working from home. Meeting people and networking is still very crucial in your development.
