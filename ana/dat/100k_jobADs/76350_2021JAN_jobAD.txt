 11 Questions about SEX that you should ask – part four -> 
 Finding a Job in 2011: I may not have the "Golden Voice" like Ted Williams but Give me a break! Part One 
 Posted on  January 24, 2011  by  Ressurrection 
 
 We have heard of the number of Americans unemployed. We have constant reminders of percentages. When they are speaking badly about the president or economic patterns, we hear it in the numbers. When we are hearing it in the positive they speak in percentages because the slight progress won't sound as slight if they do so. 
 I have been looking for a job for about two years. When I closed my business I began looking a little harder than before. In the event of closing a business you still have responsibilities, you can't just walk away. 
 With a child and knowledge of what my household income must be in order to take care of us, I find it exhausting and alarming that I can't seem to find employment. 
 Of the last ten government jobs I have applied for seven of the screeners, have passed me through to a hiring manager. However, I am informed that of the applications received from the screener, the hiring manager gets to scale the number down even more. If two-hundred apply, sixty pass through, the hiring manager has the right to choose three if he wants to. 
 That may make his job easy but it sure makes me feel like one of the children in "Honey I shrunk the kids." I am clearly applying for the right kind of jobs however the competition is fierce. 
 What is the extra cherry on top in your resume, application or waiting process that you must do to make sure you are not overlooked? 
 I have been told in the past that my name is a reason to discriminate because it is Ressurrection. I am a black woman, thick with locks. Did I fail to mention that I am black and a woman? 
 Today I was told that I should consider applying for jobs that are looking for diversity, like being a Firefighter. 
 Really? Is this the place that we have come to? I am not fighting fires and the only pole I'm sliding down,  WHOA NELLY  , my apologies. Had I finished that punchline this article would have taken an unexpected turn for parental guidance necessary. 
 As I shared with a friend today, I have applied for everything, with the exception of being a Firefighter. I have been said to be over-qualified for obvious reasons and under-qualified in denial letters for positions I could do in my sleep with my pinky toe. 
 I have been a business woman for a decade immersing myself into the creative process, strategic planning, marketing forecasts, business plan writing and taking classes which certify me in private and government business. 
 I have written poetry and have been published since I was 12. I have most recently written a memoir and I write a daily blog that you are reading now and encouraged to share with others. I am capable, and I have a clear understanding of my gifts. 
 I remember being fifteen and sixteen working in the lowest paying position, being trusted by management to learn and execute their work. I am not a sideline applicant. I can't take orders that I never have input on. In high school, I was the girlfriend on the basketball team, and I liked that position just fine. I wasn't the watergirl, I didn't want to flirt with all the players, just one. 
 I am very focused yet flexible. I like to solve problems and I love to make connections. According to Malcolm Gladwell's book,  The Tipping Point  , I am a  Connector.

 I Had A Dream And It Came True! (Wedding) 
 
 
 Ressurrection 's Wedding on the National Mall - OPEN INVITATION August 28, 2013 
 The President is expected to attend the festivities at the Martin Luther King Jr. and/or Lincoln Memorials to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the March on Washington and the I Have A Dream speech. One couple in the Nation’s Capital will commemorate this speech with their wedding ceremony scheduled at the Jefferson Memorial at 2pm on August 28th, 2013. During this monumental wedding ceremony the couple will share their vows and incorporate their Martin Luther King Jr. inspired theme, “I Had A Dream And It Came True.” An earthquake shook the Washington DC Area on August 23rd, 2011, and a Tornado followed that week. But the sun came out on August 28th, 2011, the 48th anniversary of the, "I have a dream" speech. After Graves returned from the opening day of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial her Groom made his move, they talked over a game of chess, in which she won the game and his heart. Graves had witnessed a reenactment of Martin Luther King Jr. speaking on that day. She believed it to be a tape recording until she saw a gentlemen from California drawing a crowd. With such a rich beginning Graves and Groom intend to share their nuptials as a public testament of their strength, faith and love. They welcome those who celebrate love to join them on the lawn of the Jefferson Memorial, at 2pm on August 28, 2013 the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.’s speech saying, “I Had A Dream And It Came True.”

*  On The Greek word “pharmakia”  October 27, 2013 
 Originally posted on True Discernment: The Greek word “pharmakia” literally means “drugs”, and appears five times in the New Testament: in Gal 5:20, Rev 9:21, 18:23, 21:8, and 22:15. “Pharmakia” is translated into our English Bible as either “witchcraft” or…
