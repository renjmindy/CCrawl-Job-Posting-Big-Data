 Do you want to drive Continuous Improvement prcesses for one of the Midlands most dynamic 3PL logistics businesses? I'm currently recruiting a Continuous Improvement Lead to drive site-wide CI implementation. Based near Sutton Coldfield, the successful candidate will earn up to £33,000. 
 The successful candidate will join in a highly autonomous role reporting directly to the site GM, and as such you will work very closely with the site senior management team for operations. With no "red tape" to cut through you will be given a blank canvas to make improvements, if you provide the data to justify projects then you will be encouraged to implement them. 
 The site is a multi-contract/multi-channel environment, with plenty of opportunities to make a difference to a number of customers, and huge variety to your work. The key responsibilities for the successful candidate will be to successfully deliver projects, removing waste from processes & improving efficiency across the site. 
 Part of your induction will be an in-depth company introduction at the European Head Office, and you will benefit from insight of quarterly meetings with the Group Head of Continuous Improvement as part of your development, as well as the opportunity to be sponsored to become Six Sigma Black Belt accredited. 
 Based near Sutton Coldfield you will be paid up to £33,000 with competitive benefits. To be successful in the role you will need to be a self-starter who is data driven and can communicate at all levels. 
 For more information please apply to the role or contact Phil Birch on 07970 211517. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
