 Casino Career You May Not Have Thought Of 
 __ Tina Golden

 __ Latest Casino and Gambling News ,  Casino News 
 Florida  has had  Vegas -style  slot machines  for a couple of years and they continue to grow in popularity as casino gambling has grown in the state. All those machines need to be cleaned, repaired and maintained spawning a new demand for qualified slot technicians within the gambling industry. Now those who want to explore that career choice have a training option specifically geared towards them. 
 The Sheridan Technical Center in  Hollywood, Florida  is the first school to offer a state-approved course in slot machine repair. The first 9-week session has 25 students currently enrolled. Students pay tuition and fees of $651 for the course. They must have clean criminal records and be at least 21 to enroll in the course. 
 The Seminole Indians have casinos in the state with thousands of slot machines with plans for 15,000 more in the near future. Spokesman Gary Bitner says the demand for qualified technicians will be very high and that the pay rate goes as much as $18 per hour. Demand for slot technicians will continue to grow as more states allow slot machines in bars, racetracks and casinos throughout the country.
