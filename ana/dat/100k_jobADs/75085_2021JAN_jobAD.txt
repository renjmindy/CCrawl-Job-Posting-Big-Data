 Both Sides Now

 So, what I think is my last match ever taped for BGEast is now out there for purchase, streaming or however you watch your BGEast videos. 
 And yes, it's my second appearance in the  Jobberpaloozer  series, and I am wrestling this guy: 
 Yup, none other than Cole Cassidy. 
 Christ, look at that body. I mean….  look  at it. 
 In an interesting aside, the last match of mine to be released was actually the  first  one I ever taped. 
 Not in my best shape I was ever in for the cameras-I'd been on a grueling book/speaking tour that started in January of that year and didn't end until BEA in New York in June-but I was doing my best to hit the gym when I was at home and trying to eat right, but trying to eat healthy when you're on the road isn't always easy. 
 But I was very excited to shoot a match for BGEast, and I was even more excited to be scheduled to wrestle one of my idols, Cole Cassidy. I blogged about him sometime recently; but I became a fan when I first saw him in the ring against Tarzan Tyler Reese. So, when the Boss asked me who I wanted to get into the ring with, Cole was at the top of my list. 
 Dreams can come true. 
 But this could also be filed under  be careful what you wish for … 
 Intimidating, no? 
 I could be wrong, but I think I may be the only wrestler who's appeared in the  Jobberpaloozer  series as both heel and jobber. 
 Which is saying something-what that might be I am not quite sure, honestly.
