 Job Description 
 Posting Title 
Personal Banker - Arlington Downtown 
 Location/Division 
535 N Olympic Ave (BR), Arlington, WA 
 Job Description 
Financial Wellness education is a big opportunity in our communities. In response to that need, Key's branches have become more advice centered. We equip our Bankers with a state-of-the-art digital tool that empowers them to have deeper conversations with clients. This tool allows us to deliver expert advice to our clients and gets them thinking about important questions related to their finances. 
 The financial wellness platform does the heavy lifting in these conversations. You don't have to be a financial expert to be a successful Personal Banker, you just need to have a strong desire to help people make better financial choices and be good at starting conversations, quickly building a rapport, and asking deeper questions. You really need to love the sales process, providing solutions to clients' needs, and the excitement of achieving sales goals to be successful in this role. 
 You'll work with the public. Empathy and a willingness to treat our clients like you would a family member is critical. Everyone is at a different place on their financial journey and we are here to help them in any way we can. 
 What You'll Get from This Opportunity: 
Our total incentive compensation plan is highly competitive (salary + generous bonuses for high performers). 
Generous and unique benefits - 401(k) matching (dollar-for-dollar up to 6%), generous PTO, fitness and tuition reimbursement, and so much more. 
You are exposed to many areas of expertise in this role (Mortgage Loan Officers, Financial Advisors, Branch Managers, etc.) and will uncover multiple avenues for career growth and development (we support becoming licensed or following the many other career paths within the bank). 
Paid job training and access to a library of specialized professional development and training courses. 
Access to a formal enterprise mentoring program. 
There is a lot of daily variety in this role. 
 Essential Job Functions: 
Solution-based sales, delivering exceptional client service in every interaction. 
Providing clients with ease, value and expertise by taking them through financial wellness reviews and answering any questions they might have. 
Developing strong partnerships with line of business partners - focusing on client acquisition and deepening the relationship of current clients; effectively managing internal and external centers of influence. 
Calling on a book of business, setting appointments, following up on referrals, and going out into the field to obtain new business. 
Opening personal and business accounts (consumer checking, small business, various deposit products, home equity, unsecured lending, certificates of deposit, etc.). 
Sometimes supporting branch operations such as assisting with client transactions on the Teller line and maintaining documentation on interactions with clients. 
Ensuring compliance with operational, risk, security and audit procedures and policies including appropriate documentation of client interactions. 
All Branch team members are expected to act professionally at all times, conduct business ethically, avoid conflicts of interest and act in the best interest our clients and Key. 
 Required Qualifications: 
High School Diploma, GED or equivalent experience (undergraduate degree preferred). 
1 year of experience in developing current and new customer relationships, achieving sales goals and building referral sources. Experience with sales is more important than financial services experience. KeyBank provides the tools and training, but we need natural relationship builders who are great at sparking conversations. 
The ideal Personal Banker is sales-driven, self-motivated, and competitive. The best bankers always know their numbers and find ways to drive towards success. 
Interpersonal interaction skills and an ability to build rapport in matter of minutes is vital. 
Foundational knowledge of sales and service techniques with consumers and small businesses, including tele-consulting, outside calling, prospecting and networking. Comfort going out on business calls, overcoming objection, and asking fact-finding questions with the goal of being helpful. 
A keen ability to manage your time and own your day - balancing serving clients and growing your book of business. 
Demonstrated experience with influencing business partners and leveraging centers of influence, as this role will require significant influence of partners such as Key Investment Services, Mortgage and Business Banking sales professionals. 
Proven customer service and communication skills and ability to work in a small team environment. 
Working knowledge of PCs (MS Windows and Office Products including Word, Excel, etc.). 
Ability to work branch hours, typically includes Saturday mornings. 
Must have access to reliable transportation to facilitate travel outside of the branches, including outside sales calls. 
Physical Requirements: Frequent mobility (5-8 hours) in an office setting, ability to communicate face to face and on the phone with clients, frequent use of hands to manipulate/grasp objects, occasional bending and lifting from floor height, frequent lifting of 1 - 10 lbs., occasional lifting of up to 30 lbs. 
 What It's Like to Work with Us: 
 When we say our branches are like families, we mean it. Our branches are typically small, tight-knit teams that support one another and help each other grow. At Key we pride ourselves on being a highly collaborative culture that wins by sharing, networking, and supporting fellow team members. We also extend that welcoming culture to the clients we serve. We are seeing longer client tenure, higher savings growth and higher satisfaction scores from clients who have gone through financial wellness reviews. Our branch client impact stories are inspiring. We are developing emotional connections with clients by helping them on their path to smarter finances. Come join us, we truly do work that matters. 
 Key's application process for Personal Banker position(s) require that you complete our Skill Match Survey. The Skill Match Survey can be taken via computer or mobile device and will take 20-30 minutes to complete. This will help us to learn more about you and determine if we are a good match. In addition, following the completion of the survey, we'll provide you with feedback on your top impact skill. After completing the application, you will be prompted to take the Skill Match Survey.
