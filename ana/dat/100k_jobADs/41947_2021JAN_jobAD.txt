 "I was in the HR and recruiting and staffing industry for many years before I decided to flip to the other side. After all those years, I saw the disadvantage that job seekers and professionals were at in the workplace. They didn't understand what was happening in HR and I thought if I could bridge that gap and teach people that, they would do a better job when looking for work and when they were on the job." 
 I'm not here to tell you these secrets to scare you, but rather to inform you. If you understand them, it can help you to think through your actions while working with HR and Recruiting.
