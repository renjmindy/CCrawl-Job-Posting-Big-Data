 Swimmin' pools, movie stars!! 
 October 9, 2012  /  julesagray  /  10 Comments 
 Hey, take a gander at last week's paycheck from the temp job I have! Hope you're sitting down because you're gonna be shocked, SHOCKED by how much money I'm making. 
 
 Let me remind you folks that jealousy is a soul-killer, and if you let the green monster invade your being, it'll hurt you in an Ebola kinda way. 
 You aren't worthy. Really. The sooner you realize this, the better. 
 If you need me, I'll be hanging out with Mitt while we move moneys around our Swiss bank accounts just for shits and giggles.

 Gotye & KC -- Ermahgerdified. 
 July 25, 2012July 25, 2012  /  julesagray  /  7 Comments 
 For my muses:  Kate ,  Leah , and Beezus. 
 A friend sent me  this , and I'm gonna have some fun with it -- at  Gotye 's  expense. And, KC & The Sunshine Band's. 
 First, the video. 
 Here are some of the lyrics -- ERMAHGERD-STYLE. 
 Now and then I think of when we were together 
 NER ERND THERN I THERNK ERF WHERN WER WER TERGERTHER 
 Like when you said you felt so happy you could die 
 LERK WHERN U SERD U FERLT SER HERPER U CERLD DER 
 I told myself that you were right for me 
 I TERLD MAHSERLF THERT U WER RERGHT FER MAH 
 But felt so lonely in your company 
 BERT FERLT SER LERNERLER ERN YER CERMPERNER 
 But that was love and it's an ache I still remember 
 BERT THERT WERS LERV ERND ERTS ERN ERCH I STERL RERMERMBER 
 And now, for a little KC. 
 I want to put on my my my my my 
Boogie shoes 
Just to boogie with you, yeah 
I want to put on my my my my my 
Boogie shoes just to boogie with you, uh huh 
 I WERNT TER PERT ERN MAH MAH MAH MAH MAH BERGER SHERS JERST TER BERGER WERTH U, YER WERNT TER PERT ERN MAH MAH MAH MAH MAH BERGER SHERS JERST TER BERGER WERTH U, ER HER 
 I don't know how to explain the phenom that is ERMAHGERD. All I know is it's some wacky meme that is awesome at wasting my time and making me laugh so hard I SNORT. 
 
 Why yes, I am easily amused in case you were wondering.

 You get the idea.
