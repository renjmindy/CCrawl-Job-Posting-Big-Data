 Job 24 
 1 Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days? 
 2 Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof. 
 3 They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge. 
 4 They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together. 
 5 Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children. 
 6 They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked. 
 7 They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold. 
 8 They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter. 
 9 They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor. 
 10 They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry; 
 11 Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst. 
 12 Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them. 
 13 They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof. 
 14 The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief. 
 15 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face. 
 16 In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light. 
 17 For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death. 
 18 He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards. 
 19 Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned. 
 20 The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree. 
 21 He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow. 
 22 He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life. 
 23 Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways. 
 24 They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn. 
 25 And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?

 “But they disappear like foam down a river. Everything they own is cursed, and they are afraid to enter their own vineyards. And though they are great now, in a moment they will be gone like all others, cut off like heads of grain. 
Job 24:18‭, ‬24 NLT 
Job speak about evil people living in the dark . I like what job said earlier in the the chapter everything they own is cursed if God is not getting the praise in the things you do or things you have then it's cursed we must remember everything have on Earth will one day dissipate

 Like the heart, your eyes cannot be trusted. The things that we see or do not see are the results of what we are looking for. We know from experience that God does not let the wicked go unpunished and that the Lord does chastise his children. But here, job is saying that the wicked get away with everything despite what we know is true. As Christians, we need to learn to be looking to and fro with the eyes of the Lord and not through our heart and our own perception because that is where the devil can lay traps for. Our eyes can deceive us just as much as an hour heart again so it must be protected

 1 Thessalonians 5:

 5. Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness. 
 Ephesians 5: 
8. For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:

 ““God, in his power, drags away the rich. They may rise high, but they have no assurance of life. They may be allowed to live in security, but God is always watching them. And though they are great now, in a moment they will be gone like all others, cut off like heads of grain. Can anyone claim otherwise? Who can prove me wrong?”” 
‭‭Job‬ ‭24:22-25‬ ‭NLT‬‬ 
 Wicked will never prosper. 
The Word says the blessed are the pure in heart the man of God last night reminded us all of that. God is always watching and will continue to always watch. Sometimes it just doesn’t seem fair when we see all these folks in sin getting away with anything and everything. It may seem like they’re getting blessed but really they’re not at all. The blessing is when you have Gods favor, when you have Gods security, when you have his peace his love. When your wicked or doing wicked deeds and acts I would say that crosses out all of those. They may think they have peace but they don’t, they may think they have love but true love is relationship with Christ. I say pray for the wicked, pray for those guys that don’t care or acknowledge the real sin out there. 
Be blessed today in jesus name

 Sleeping with one eye open 
 23 Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways. 
 I remember my Dad telling me stories of Veitnam. He said that you had to sleep with one eye open because you never knew when the attack would come, when the enemy would sneak up on you. I begin to think about our warfare this morning, how it is not carnal but our wars are caught on our knees and through prayers and supplication with God. We cannot let the enemy take our rest, we cannot pray with one eye open. We have to put in the full armor of God and know that it will protect us. We will pull down the strongholds when we stop focusing on this world around us and really entreat God with both eyes closed. How can you ever find real rest when one eye is always open? Let us trust in God and begin to pray with all we got, focused only on him and not lose our focus to what is going on around us.

 Nothing is promised to stand forever, except for God and His Word. Tomorrow is not promised. All we have is temporary. He is a God that gives and takes away. We have season that we go through, there's no telling how long those seasons last. But He is a God of Blessings and Provision. I praise Your Holy Name!!

 Job 24:1 [Amp] Why [ seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty] does He not set seasons for judgement? Why do those who know Him see not His days [ for punishment of the wicked] ? 
[ Acts 1:7] He said to them , It is not for you to become acquainted with and know what times brings [ the things and events of time and their definite periods] or fixed years and seasons [ their critical years and seasons [ their critical niche in time] , which the Father has appointed [ fixed and reserved] by His own choice and authority and personal power. You have time to restore your life and get baptize in Jesus name for the remission of your sins. To receive the gift of the Holy Ghost ! It's a blessing to know him as your saviour. We must be saved.

 ““Why doesn’t the Almighty bring the wicked to judgment? Why must the godly wait for him in vain?” 
‭‭Job‬ ‭24:1‬ ‭NLT‬‬ 
 Job is asking why the wicked are not punished. They get punished in their own way and for some it’s an eternal punishment. It’s our job to reach out to them and help them turn away from those old things and old ways and have a new life.

 They harvest a field they do not own, and they glean in the vineyards of the wicked. All night they lie naked in the cold, without clothing or covering. They are soaked by mountain showers, and they huddle against the rocks for want of a home. 
Job 24:6‭-‬8 NLT 
 https://bible.com/bible/116/job.24.6-8.NLT 
 It's always like that, people work for others and still suffer, because they may not have the education, or talk right, they try to take advantage of them, they see a person is desperate for work and tries to take advantage of the fact, you work and they dont want to pay you the value of your work. God rewards us for our dilegence, he knows what our needs are and he meets them as long as we are faithful in tithing and giving! Thank you Jesus, for your provision!

 https://bible.com/bible/1/job.24.24-25.KJV 
 So this much I know to be true. Yes the wicked are exalted for a time, but how long depends on God. I have seen how God will strip a man of everything to show that he needs to seek God. As for me; yes there are things that have been stripped from me due to lack of faith and trying to do it on my own. How does it work when everything is removed from me. Well it just means that for a time I stepped out of the will of God. I know that I should and need to seek Him first in all that I do. Each time I step out; God will move things to say um Joe: what do you think you're doing? Ok then, I'll just move this out of his path and replace it with the things that will move him to come back to Me. God cares about where I'm at and what I'm doing for Him and the Kingdom. I can talk till I'm blue in the face, but what good is it if all I'm doing is rambling. God wants us/me to speak diligently about the Kingdom. We/I are soul seekers not people pleasers. First the Kingdom; thank you Jesus.

 It might look Good but it's really not . EVERYTHING they owned is cursed. God sees the wicked and although it might look like they are getting away with it . He's just giving them time to repent before he unleash his wrath

‭‭Job‬ ‭24:1‬ ‭NIRV‬‬ 
 It may seem as if people are getting away with sinful actions but God sees all. Everyone will reap what they have sown. If we sow good things we’ll reap good and if we sow sin and corrupt things that’s what we will reap.

 It's interesting how this scripture refers to rebellion as rebelling against the light. It reminded me of what Bro Morgan had to say last night about music. Because what is rebelling against the light? It's going into darkness. Don't run away from the light. Run towards the light of Jesus.

 Evil deeds done in darkness are still known by God. The unrighteous may seem to prosper for a time but we all still answer to God. When we are in need, we must call out to God and wait for him, not take matters into our own hands and steal. Let him be our father and provide our every need.

 Job 24 
 2 Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof. 
 Proverbs 22:28 
Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set. 
 This world has walked away from the landmarks of truth. Even some of the greatest preachers teachers became so prosperous they lost sight of what the true purpose of their calling was. Souls. They took everything they could became pious and soon began to remove the old ancient landmarks. They are leading flocks in the opposite direction of where they used to. Landmarks are important they are familiar identifications to help someone like me who had no idea which is North or South. They do live in prosperity nothing wrong with that except they have completely walked away from truth. 
Landmarks of Salvation Acts 2:38 , Landmarks if Be ye separate from the world, Landmarks of outward holiness modesty, Landmarks of Integrity. Yet they lead fliocks of people. We must continue to Seek First the Kingdom by keeping the Landmarks in place.

 Their time will come. When, where, how? It’s none of our concern. If they continue down that path they will. So we can’t continue to look at how good these people have it. (In worldly eyes) but we know that God is always watching. And it’s our job to tell them about Gods Grace and Mercy.

13They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof. 
 We live in a generation that rebels against the light. Anything that is right has been determined to be wrong by our generation. The Word of God is Light. Therefore when society chooses to do the opposite of what the Bible says to do, this is the definition of rebelling against the light. One of the actual definitions of the word rebel is a person who resists any authority, control, or tradition. 
 We must keep the light burning regardless of how society attempts to prove themselves right.

 24 They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn. 
 This is exactly what we see when we look at those that enjoy sin in their life. No matter how successful they appear to be, their season will surely pass. You can not sow wickedness and reap honor. You can not sow discord and expect to reap unity and peace. There is so much that we see going on around us, but we must not allow it to affect our relationship with God and tarnish our spirits. 
 The scripture states it- Hebrews 11 
24By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; 25Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; 26Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward. 27By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible. 
 We can not take hold in the temporal things of this world but hold fast for the eternal rewards of Glory. If we seek first the kingdom of God, then we will live in the overflow of God’s blessings 
 I love the kingdom

 Darkness is used as a cover to hide sin. The wicked fear the morning, afraid that it will bring their sin to light. 
 One should think of the morning as something good; the coming of light after the dark night. But for the wicked, morning is the same as the “shadow of death”. 
 Do you live in the light or fear it? 
 “The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying. But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.”

 Job 24 Amplified Bible (AMP) 
 Job Says God Seems to Ignore Wrongs 
24 “Why does the Almighty not set seasons for judgment? 
Why do those who know Him not see His days [for punishment of the wicked]? 
 We must keep our eyes on Jesus. If we allow our flesh to watch other people we will surely fall because in our eyes it seems as if some people get away with so much. 
 However, we must remember, we are not the judge. There are things that we do the God should judge us for as well, but we overlook those things, by picking apart others. 
 Lord help us to keep our focus on you, and keep unity in the body by allow You to be God and remembering that we are not.

 FIRST THE KINGDOM 
PATIENCE 
 1 Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days? 
 Serving GOD is Life Development, we should become like HIM more and more each day. This life development process includes all areas. Faith, Hope, Love, Temperance and Patience to name a few. 
 In the times that we do not seem to know what GOD is doing in us or where HE is in our situation, JESUS is calling us to TRUST HIM to build our FAITH and we must have PATIENCE to do that. 
 Patience is a deep rooted discipline that is destroyed by pride and self will. As we mature spiritually we allow GOD to work in HIS time according to HIS will and we KNOW. 
 Romans 8:28 And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.

 “Why doesn’t the Almighty bring the wicked to judgment? Why must the godly wait for him in vain? 
Job 24:1 NLT 
 The real question Job is asking is one that is still asked by many today: WHY DOESN'T GOD DO THINGS THE WAY I THINK HE SHOULD? 
 People ask this all the time with slight variations: If there is a God, then where was He when that man killed innocent people in a church, when terrorists murder innocent children for their faith or behead captives who refuse to convert? If God is good, then why are children abused or abducted and sold as sex-slaves? Why do tsunamis and earthquakes and tornados and hurricanes take homes and lives and wipe out whole communities in an instant? Why doesn't God intervene in injustices? Why doesn't He grant my every request and make it easy for me to believe? Why doesn't He show Himself? Speak audibly to me? 
 It seems men are always trying to make God in our own image. Make Him think like us. Act like us. Do what we expect Him to do, or all that we ask Him to do. 
 The carnal mind wants a faith that, quiet honestly, requires no faith. We would rather have a Santa Claus that we can control and manipulate with our actions than a sovereign God who expects us to accept His will even when we don't understand it. 
 Paul tells Timothy to "fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life," (1 Tim. 6:12). Later, he says, "I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith," (2 Timothy 4:7). 
 You see, the making-it-to-heaven kind of faith isn't easy; it's a fight. It's believing when things don't make sense. It's hoping against hope. It's standing faithful when God says "no," or when He doesn't seem to say anything at all. It rises up in the face of doubt and fear and all the world's "proof" that there is no God and proclaims His name anyway. It doesn't waiver when disappointed. It trusts even in the midst of a crumbling world. 
 Those with this true saving faith understand that they may never understand the ways of God. Calvary is all the proof they need that God is for them and that He is working for their eternal good. They stop saying things like "God, if You love me, You'll do this or that." They stop questioning God when things don't go the way they think they should. They seek God's will rather than their own, and they surrender themselves completely to the sovereignty of the One they cannot see but Whom they have no doubt has called them by name. 
 "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good report…. But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him…. These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them…wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God…"

 "An illusion of Security" 
What a way to describe a person living in sin. 
 That's exactly what sin is, an illusion. Rather, sin creates an illusory separation from God, but if we were truly separated from God we simply would not exist, we would not be. 
 Romans 8:38-39 "For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord." 
 No matter the illusion, no matter the sin, NOTHING shall be able to separate us from the LOVE of God.

 24 They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn. 
 Ever notice the tip or narrow end of an ear of corn, how the kernels are not as big and juicy as the rest of the ear? This is because the kernels at the top of the ear the last to be fertilized and have less time to mature. For those in the corn business, these immature kernels cost more to process and yield less product than the is worth the time. Thus, cutting off the tops of the ears is a process to remove the least fruitful portion of the harvest. 
 Where do we rank amongst other kernels of corn? Are we ripe, juicy and ready to be harvested or are we the weak immature small kernels that may be severed from the harvest?

 ““Wicked people rebel against the light. They refuse to acknowledge its ways or stay in its paths. The murderer rises in the early dawn to kill the poor and needy; at night he is a thief. The adulterer waits for the twilight, saying, ‘No one will see me then.’ He hides his face so no one will know him. Thieves break into houses at night and sleep in the daytime. They are not acquainted with the light. The black night is their morning. They ally themselves with the terrors of the darkness.” 
‭‭Job‬ ‭24:13-17‬ ‭NLT‬‬

15 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face. 
16 In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light. 
 It was almost as if Job anticipated the later instruction from the Apostle Paul in Romans 13: 12-14

 “Why doesn’t the Almighty bring the wicked to judgment? Why must the godly wait for him in vain? The poor are pushed off the path; the needy must hide together for safety. “God, in his power, drags away the rich. They may rise high, but they have no assurance of life. 
Job 24:1‭, ‬4‭-‬4‭, ‬22 NLT 
 We ask why and continue to ask. We are seeing here with the carnal eye. Let us not forget that GOD makes the rich and the poor. I am reminded of a sermon preached in Toledo, Ohio by Matt Maddix. 
If i remember correctly I think it was something like this. 'if we reach for the people that nobody wants, GOD will give us the people everyone wants!' 
We must remember that GOD is no repector of persons. So rich or poor let us reach for those bound by sin, addictions, money, etc. We all need a saviour, salvation and abundant life is only found in Jesus❤❤❤

 Verse 20 says….. 
 20 The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree. 
 When we are going our way into the world we forget all about Jesus. The wicked will not be light but darkness. We always have to be getting our energy and inspiration from Jesus to be a light to the world. If we are not doing what the Bible says, and praying everyday we are not following his word. Like the message Pastor gave us the other day about Revival. Revival can’t happen if the church is not praying. So we have to pray and let God speak to us in order for Revival to happen.

 Landmark are very important. When I'm driving landmarks help me remember how to get back to my destination. It gives me a sense of direction when I can't remember street names. The same is true for our walk with God. There are spiritual landmarks that should never be removed. They should be honored and upheld. They give us direction to blessings and promise.

 Thieves break into houses at night and sleep in the daytime. They are not acquainted with the light. The black night is their morning. They ally themselves with the terrors of the darkness. “But they disappear like foam down a river. Everything they own is cursed, and they are afraid to enter their own vineyards. 
Job 24:16‭-‬18 NLT 
This verse reminded me of what a preacher said about someone who doesn't pay their tithes. God calls people robbers if they don't pay tithes. Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. 
Malachi 3:8 KJV 
I heard it said that if people don't pay their tithes they are driving a stolen car and living in a stolen house! The Bible does go on to say: Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation. 
Malachi 3:9 KJV 
The verse in Job confirms that"everything they (the thieves) own is cursed! " No thank you!

 I Love To Worship The Lord 
 Job 24:1 (Time for judgment) 
This verse is the chapter's key. Job does not question God's justice, but only His timing. Eliphaz assumed a knee-jerk God - with sin He reacts immediately. But the N.T. reminds us, The Lord is not slow in keeping His promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance. (2 Peter 3:9)

 Job 24:13-16 
13) They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof. 
14) The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief. 
15) The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face. 
16) In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light. 
 "They rebel against the light / They know not the light" 
 These scriptures made me think of St. John 3:17-20 
17) For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. 
18) He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. 
19) And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. 
20) For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. 
 All you have to do is fill in the word "light" with JESUS - for JESUS said in St. John 8:12, "… I am the light of the world…"

 The wicked only get to enjoy their spoils for a little while before judgment comes. They take advantage of Gods grace and inflict havoc on many. I believe in order to try people in different areas of their life. Trouble don’t last always. For weeping can last for a night but joy comes in the morning. In a way this may encourage Job that even though he is going through the fire, he will overcome. We can learn a lesson from his faithfulness.

 We must not try to remove what God has already put into place. His word stands strong against all evil. His word also declares that he is God and he changes not. The world will try to manipulate God's word, but the truth will always stand strong.

 As I read this chapter, several things hit: 
 
 Deuteronomy says to do the opposite of what many are doing in these verses. 
 MY God is not slack, and WILL NOT be mocked. Just because we might not see judgement fall on someone, doesn’t mean they got away with something, maybe Jesus is trying to allow them a chance to repent.

 Verse 13 AMP “Others have been with those who rebel against the light; They do not want to know its ways Nor stay in its paths." John 8:12 NLT says "Jesus spoke to the people once more and said, “I am the light of the world. If you follow me, you won’t have to walk in darkness, because you will have the light that leads to life.” Same verse VOICE "On another occasion, Jesus spoke to the crowds again. Jesus: I am the light that shines through the cosmos; if you walk with Me, you will thrive in the nourishing light that gives life and will not know darkness.

 Throughout this chapter it explains many different scenarios in which “seeing times” are not hidden but revealed. 
I feel as though my favorite of them all is what follows: 
 22 He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life. 
 He is so great and so big that he picks up EVERYTHING mighty with His power. Anything great and mighty all together at the same time and He picks it up all together like it is nothing. This proves ahis mighty power. He then rises up and because of His great powerful can be sure of his own life?

 From the [populous and crowded] city men groan, And the souls of the wounded cry out for help; Yet God [seemingly] does not pay attention to the wrong [done to them]. “Others have been with those who rebel against the light; They do not want to know its ways Nor stay in its paths. 
JOB 24:12‭-‬13 AMP 
 https://bible.com/bible/1588/job.24.12-13.AMP 
 Some cry out to God for help and others choose to stay in that situation. Its a mentality a way of thinking maybe. If you think your poor or in poverty chances are, you are. Maybe instead of looking at the when i come up in the world im going to do this and this, maybe you should be asking for the wisdom to do these things with what you have now. God hears your plea, make no mistake about that, but what are you crying out for? Are crying out for a solution or are you crying out for the steps you should take to come to the solution. How am i going to eat today,NO, now what can i do to make sure that i eat for the rest of the week. Its a bigger picture mentality. Jesus said i am the truth the way and the light. Here's the truth about your situation ill show you the way but you have to be willing to step into the light.

 “Dominion and awe belong to God; He establishes peace and order in His high places. Is there any number to His [vast celestial] armies? And upon whom does His light not rise? 
JOB 25:2‭-‬3‭ AMP 
 https://bible.com/bible/1588/job.25.2-6.AMP 
 Does he not rule over all? Who doesnt his light shine upon? He gives equal opportunity. There is no number to his army which means it can grow. Doesnt matter who you are where you came from or what your doing, God is not discriminate, his truth is for everyone. You have to choose to believe you have to choose where your faith is and you have to choose what you worship and give glory to. Job worshipped and gave glory to God and kept his commandments but where did his faith go when things went south? Where does faith go, when things arent going right?

Job describes the kind of sin that happens under the cover of darkness. Darkness is used as a cloak for the murderer, the thief, and the adulterer. 
It was almost as if Job anticipated the later instruction from the Apostle Paul. 
 “The night is almost gone; the day of salvation will soon be here. So remove your dark deeds like dirty clothes, and put on the shining armor of right living. Because we belong to the day, we must live decent lives for all to see. Don’t participate in the darkness of wild parties and drunkenness, or in sexual promiscuity and immoral living, or in quarreling and jealousy. Instead, clothe yourself with the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ. And don’t let yourself think about ways to indulge your evil desires.”

 They wicked they love the darkness. The feel comfortable and safe, they have a feeling no one is watching. They hide in the dark and surprise their victim. All is done in secret, which is sin. We must let light shine on you. Let everyone know your intentions, your attitude and heart. There are no secrets, cause you know God is watching over you.
