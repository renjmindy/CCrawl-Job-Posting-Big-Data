 Guest Post: Searching for an academic position on maternity leave 
 Posted in  Guest Posts ,  Work-Life Balance  by  Guest Blogger 
 _Today 's guest post is by Chicken_little. Chicken_little is a postdoc in clinical psychology in the midst of an existential career crisis - but officially in search of an academic position. She studies the impact of mindfulness interventions in various populations, although she very often forgets to practice mindfulness in her daily life. When she is not working or reading funny academic tweets, she is the proud mom of a baby boy. _ 
 
 I’m sitting at the kitchen table trying to finish a manuscript. I can hear my son yelling in his crib, refusing to take his nap. As I try to concentrate on bringing the finishing touches to my soon-to-be submitted paper, I can’t help but feel incredibly guilty of, once again, favoring my work over my son. The appeal of a tenure-track position is big, and so is the pressure to be productive and to get out several manuscripts this year, even though I am (supposed to be) on maternity leave. 
 Thank goodness my spouse is home and is there to soothe the baby. Being a postdoc and working from home does have benefits : I was able to transfer my maternity leave to my partner, so we can both spend some time with our son in his first year of life. But let’s be honest here : having him at home only means that I can get more work done, as he watches the baby. I am trying to make things happen for my career all the while he is putting his own on hold. This better pay off. 
 This is what I have learned so far on being a mom and a postdoc in search of an academic position at the same time :  Continue reading ->

 Life on a work visa 
 Posted in  Field Notes  by  hkotek 
 This year, like the two that preceded it and at least the next to follow, I will be unable to make summer plans. As someone with a non-permanent position, I am constantly chasing opportunities and gearing up to take the next step, move on to the next position. I expect to live in a different location from one year to the next. As a non-permanent resident, my journey is compounded by visa complications that make me unable to travel for anywhere from 2-4 months around the summer months. 
 This means a not insignificant amount of lost opportunities for me. I never accept invitations to teach at summer schools or speak at conferences or workshops. I don't even apply for summer conferences, I just don't know where I'll be over the summer and in the following year. In fact, right now, as I worry about a commitment I foolishly made two years ago to attend an event this July, I am unable to make travel plans because the one thing I  do  know is that I will  not  live in the same place in July as I do now. But where I will live – and more relevantly, where I should book a flight from/to – that is at the moment a mystery. These difficulties, and the anxieties that they give rise to, are shared between all of us who have temporary jobs. 
 Being born a citizen of the "wrong" country brings with it an additional layer of complexity, beyond that experienced by other transient academics.  Continue reading ->

 A Forced Career Gap? Pregnancy Between Positions 
 Posted in  Hiring ,  Professional Development ,  Rants ,  The Personal is Political ,  Women in Academia  by  squirrelyred 
 I’m writing about both happy news and … other news. The happy news is that the partner and I are expecting Kid #2. It’s something we’re hopeful and excited about, especially after an uncomfortable miscarriage. Maybe if I lived in a different place (I’m in the US) or a different time (please, I hope the next generation of academics and workers will have different working conditions), the news would end there. Yay for (planned) parenthood for the folks who want to be parents. End of story. 
 But it’s not. 
 This potential Kid#2 has a probable due date of right after I’m PhinisheD. Yes, right after I officially graduate, AKA in theory when I would be starting a new position. This has made postdoc and job searching – and overall career planning – very, very difficult. 
 Yes, it was my* decision to have Kid#1 and to try for Kid#2 *. Yes, technically it would be illegal for potential employers to refuse to hire me on the basis of me being a pregnant person ***. Yes, technically it would be illegal for potential employers to even ask me about a pregnancy or marriage or kids ****. 
 BUT.  Continue reading ->

 Dual Careers, One Academic 
 Posted in  Hiring ,  Work-Life Balance  by  dualitea 
 I've seen a lot written and discussed about the so-called "two body problem", as universities take on the challenge of dual career couples coming into a new position. It's a particularly important issue in my field, as the majority of married women in it are married to men in the field. The problem is that I'm not one of them, as I married someone who's career is outside of academia.  Continue reading ->

 Figuring Out My Next Steps 
 Posted in  Hiring ,  Professional Development ,  Women in Academia ,  Work-Life Balance  by  dualitea 
 I'm nearing a point in my post doc where I think I'm ready to finally start applying to faculty positions. I've gotten a few publications out, I've built a lab pretty much from the ground up, and I've mentored students in the lab ranging from high schoolers up through grad students. I've gotten leadership positions within organizations in my field, and I've managed to secure a chunk of time using the equipment at a national lab. Right now, it's also the time of year when positions are advertised for the few months before the November and I'd have to wait another year for the next one. And though I'm ready to start applying, I'm a bit concerned about leaving.
