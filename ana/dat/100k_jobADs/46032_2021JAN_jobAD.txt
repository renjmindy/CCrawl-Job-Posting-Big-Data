 Salary: 
 Open 
 Requisition Number:  F_200140 
 Department:  Computer Science & Engineering-1081 
 Description of Work: 
 The University of Nebraska-Lincoln seeks a faculty member at the assistant or associate professor level in Agricultural Sensing, Internet-of-Things (IoT), and Real-Time Low-Power Science. Food is a universal need and computing is playing an ever increasing role in all aspects of food creation and consumption. Successfully impacting the food chain will require measurement of characteristics of plants and animals. The computing systems that control measurement and action must operate within the strict bounds on timing and power consumption imposed by agricultural environments and field deployment. The computing and electronics required to overcome these challenges present a major research opportunity. Nebraska's leading position in agriculture provides important interdisciplinary opportunities at the intersection of IoT, field robotics, and agriculture. This position is motivated by the department's strategic plan to develop top programs in Agricultural IoT (Ag-IoT) and field robotics. This goal builds upon the department's existing strengths in communications and networking, robotics, embedded computing, data analytics and software engineering. 
 As part of this initiative, the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (http://cse.unl.edu) invites applications for a tenure-track faculty position at the Assistant or Associate Professor level. The successful candidate will contribute to the undergraduate and graduate academic programs within the department and demonstrate a commitment to excellence in both research and teaching. 
 The Department of Computer Science and Engineering consists of 45 faculty, 900 undergraduate students, and 125 graduate students. UNL offers an outstanding infrastructure for conducting research, including a remotely accessible city-wide wireless testbed, indoor and outdoor aerial robotics facilities, access to farm test plots, a full range of computing facilities, and the Holland Computing Center (hcc.unl.edu). Opportunities for collaborations include the College of Engineering and the Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources. 
 As an EO/AA employer, qualified applicants are considered for employment without regard to race, color, ethnicity, national origin, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, disability, age, genetic information, veteran status, marital status, and/or political affiliation. See http://www.unl.edu/equity/notice-nondiscrimination. 
 Minimum Required Qualifications: 
 Applicants are expected to have a Ph.D. or equivalent in computer science, computer engineering, or a closely related field. Applicants must have a record of strong scholarly achievement and a demonstrated commitment to excellence in undergraduate and graduate education. 
 Candidates at the assistant professor level must have the potential to establish a strong externally funded research program, while candidates at the associate professor level are expected to have an outstanding publication record, a history of funded research, and a strong national/international reputation in the areas of real-time and low-power computing systems with an interest in agricultural applications. Candidates must demonstrate a commitment to contributing to a culture that supports diversity and inclusion. 
 Preferred Qualifications: 
 Candidates with demonstrated cross-disciplinary research experience are particularly encouraged.
