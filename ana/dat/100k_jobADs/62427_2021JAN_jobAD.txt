  4 Ways To Balance Your Job Search

 It's not uncommon for job seekers to spend almost all of their time sitting behind a computer searching through online job ads. If your job search has been unsuccessful up to this point, your time behind the computer could be a major factor in your lack of success. 
 Sitting behind a computer screen is simply not the most effective use of your time out of the workforce. Here are some tips for balancing your activity during your job search: 
 
 Make It A Point To Network Every Single Week 
 The old adage, "It's not what you know, it's who you know," really is true. In most cases, a friend or colleague won't be able to get you a job for which you're not qualified, but they  may be able to get you an interview when your resume would otherwise have been overlooked. 
 Anything you do that involves talking to other people about your job search counts as networking, whether it's lunch with a former co-worker, coffee with a recruiter, or a formal networking event in your area. Some people are apprehensive about networking, but like anything in life,  the more you do it , the easier it becomes. 
 Schedule Time For Follow-Ups 
 Whether you're inquiring about a submitted job application or following up with a colleague you met while networking, these intimidating tasks often get pushed to the back burner as you prioritize your time. Scheduling them into your weekly agenda ensures that you will set aside adequate time to close the circle with various activities that you've started. 
 Update Your Social Networking Profiles 
 If you've taken the time to  develop your LinkedIn profile , you should be logging in at least once a week, and preferably more often. 
 The various groups on LinkedIn offer a never-ending conversation on topics from looking for a job to news relevant to your field. Following companies allows you to discern trends related to their hiring seasons. A  fully developed profile  also allows recruiters and hiring managers to search for you, so keep your information as current as possible. In addition, LinkedIn also allows job seekers to be more proactive in their job searches and  reach out to recruiters . 
 Build Your Personal Brand

 The candidate who walks into a job fair or interview knowing who they are and what they can provide has a remarkable edge over a candidate who's still figuring these things out. Spend some time  developing a branding statement , printing business cards for yourself, and engaging in activities that support your brand—whether that means volunteering, blogging or tweeting about your field, or consulting. 
 When you walk into a room and say, "Hi, this is who I am and this is what I do," it makes a powerful statement. 
 
 Having a polished resume is critical to your job search. However,  sending that resume off to online postings is not how you should spend 100% of your job searching time.  Make sure you're interacting with other people both in person and online to maximize your chances of standing out from the crowd. 
 Remember to stay positive during your job search and know that there are resources available to help you through this challenging process, including the resources at Work It Daily. If you  join Work It Daily,  you'll have access to one-on-one coaching that can help you through every step of the job search process.
