 Career Consultation  : Meet with our lead consultant to discuss your career goals and develop a plan, to examine any challenges that you are facing and determine a solution. 
 Interview Preparation  : Go through a series of mock interviews before you ever have your first one. We will assess your performance, provide constructive feedback and offer suggestions for improvement. 
 Proofreading Service  : We will review your document (cover letter, resume, writing sample, etc.) for any typos, grammatical errors, and citation problems. We will provide you with a clean copy of the revised version and red-lined copy against your original document. 
 Editing Service  : We will review your document (cover letter, resume, writing sample, etc.) for any typos, grammatical errors, citation problems and context concerns. Unlike proofreading (above), editing deals more with the content of your document. For example, with our editing service, we will rewrite sentences that are problematic or reorder paragraphs to achieve optimal clarity. We will provide revisions to your actual text. We also will provide you with a clean copy of the revised version and red-lined copy against your original document. 
 Drafting Service  : We will prepare a cover letter or resume for you from scratch. All you need to do is complete a simple form and answer a few questions to ensure that we know your background and the nature of the position.
