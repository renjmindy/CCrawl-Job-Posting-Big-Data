  7 Mistakes Job Seekers Make

 Are you in the process of searching for a new job but can't seem to get the callbacks you want? You could be making some big job search mistakes. Don't worry, though! We can help you identify what you're doing wrong in your job search, and how to fix it. Here are seven common mistakes job seekers make: 
 
 1. The Aimless Search 
 If you're sending out resumes without knowing what your ideal job is, you're wasting your valuable time. So, before shipping off another application, be sure to sit down and define what type of job you're looking for. This way, you'll have a more focused search and can create a  goal-oriented resume  to match. 
 2. Bad Interviewing Habits 
 Do you have bad interviewing habits? In other words, do you assume you're on a first-name basis with interviewers? Or do you slouch in your seat? If so, be sure to learn about appropriate body language and ways to address interviews so that you can always come across as a  confident candidate  with plenty to offer. 
 3. Bad-Mouthing A Previous Employer 
 Many interviewees get stuck with the question, "Why did you leave your previous employer?" While you may want to say that your previous boss was a jerk, this is not the time or place to mention it. So if you're  asked this question , just say you were looking for new opportunities to broaden your horizon. 
 4. Not Attending Job Fairs 
 While  job fairs  may feel like impersonal functions for individuals who are desperate for work, nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, some great networking opportunities can be found at job fairs, not just with company representatives but other job fair attendees. 
 5. Wearing Unprofessional Attire 
 When interviewing, company representatives are watching your every move,  including how you're dressed . If your attire is too casual, sexy, or plain outrageous, your amazing resume or interviewing skills may do little to get you hired. 
 6. Forgetting To Follow Up 
 Another mistake to avoid is not  following up  with an employer after your interview. To make sure you remain on the employer's mind, send a follow-up e-mail of about three or four paragraphs that summarizes your skills, reiterates your eagerness to be hired, and thanks the entire staff for their time. 
 7. Sending An Ultra-Long Resume 
 Although your professional history may be so amazing that you want to share every piece of it, it's important that you avoid creating  a resume that stretches out too long . By focusing on related positions and highlighting the top moments in your career, you can easily reduce your resume to two or three pages. 
 As you can see, there are a lot of ways to make mistakes when conducting your job search. The good news is that these mistakes are avoidable if you are aware of them. By following the tips above, you'll find job search success in no time!
