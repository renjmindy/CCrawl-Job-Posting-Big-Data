 Are job ads getting dumber? 
 By  hjonasson  on April 17, 2018 
 Am I too cynical or is it just impossible to take certain companies seriously when going through job application ads? 
 Today's example: 
 Weâ€™re on a mission to take over the world, and we believe that the only way to succeed with that is by having the Hungriest Digital Tigers and Toughest Tech Lions available. 
 (Well, I 'm a Cantakerous Copywriting Camel, so I guess I'm out.) 
 What Google created in 10 years, we will be creating in 6 months. 
 (I 'd put my money on this company being bankrupt in 6 months.) 
 Just send your email to our Chief People Officer â€¦ 
 (Is this an actual job title? Is anyone questioning how ridiculous this sounds? " Hello, Chief People Officer, I am the Overlord Writing Governor.") 
 Just out of curiosity, I thought I would apply because: 
 
 Aside from the lion and tiger thing, I had all the qualifications 
 If this is their ad, what kind of stories will I come away with after an interview?" 
 
 So I went to their page and it turns out, applicants are required to apply word by word as the questions show up. Starting with: 
 We are looking for a Digital Copywriter. Press YES 
 (Ok, that answer doesn 't match the question, unless I'm agreeing that YES, you ARE looking for a digital copywriter.) 
 Then I get to read the ad again and am instructed to press  CONTINUE 
 Thenâ€¦ 
 What is your first name? _________ PRESS OK. 
 Now, I can probably guess the next question, but I went ahead and exited the site instead.

 I know! in fact, I tried to Google image search "Chief People Officer" and got a lot of old pictures of Native Americans.
