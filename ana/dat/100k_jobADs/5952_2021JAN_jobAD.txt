 You and your team always do a great job 
 After attending one of our Jobinars (webinar): 
 Just a quick note on the webinar. Very informative, answered a lot of my questions. You and your team always do a great job putting these things together.  We were wondering where we might want to go this summer. This webinar pushed Delaware North at Yellowstone to the top of our list.
