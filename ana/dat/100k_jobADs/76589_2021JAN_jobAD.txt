 The Weierstrass-Institute is committed to gender equality, and therefore strongly encourage women to apply. Applications by women with equivalent qualification will be given preference. Severely disabled applicants with equivalent qualification will equally be given preferential treatment. We explicitly welcome job applications from people with migration background. WIAS is committed to the idea that  work and family should be compatible  and was awarded the "audit berufundfamilie" certificate.
