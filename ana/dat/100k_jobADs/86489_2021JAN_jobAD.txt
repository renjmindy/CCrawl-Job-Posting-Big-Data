 Group Coaching on the Job 
 VBLP’s "Group Coaching" is a consultancy approach which provides for a structured exchange  between a small group of managers within a company  – supported by an experienced coach who remains neutral while moderating and inspiring the dialogue. 
 The meetings take place among groups of up to five participants from different areas of the company. They reflect on current issues, outline their own challenges and exchange their experiences. In the spirit of  sharing best practice  , they gather  new food for thought and/or potential problem-solving solutions . 
 Moderated exchange of experiences within small groups 
 The open collegiate support available from within a small group, alongside the inspiration offered by the coach,  broadens the perspective  of each participant and  facilitates targeted self-reflection . This exchange of experiences is particularly useful during times of change. With this kind of coaching, our consultants follow a systematic approach and look to create a problem-solving environment. They each have a broad background, highly relevant experience, have undergone carefully focused training, and bring  well-founded methodological expertise . This kind of group  coaching is highly customised  – we meet the needs of the participants. Group coaching topics can include: 
 
 taking on a new (leadership) role. 
 change management – maintaining motivation, retaining high performers and providing reassurance 
 dealing with conflict (colleagues, team, supervisors) 
 integration of new staff or teams 
 
 GROUP COACHING ON THE JOB is tailor-made advice for managers who want to exchange information in a cross-departmental, target-oriented manner in order to gain fresh inspiration. The focus can be: 
 
 current issues 
 personal challenges 
 exchange of experience 
 self-reflection 
 development of solutions among high-level decision-makers 
 
 In the spirit of sharing best practice, these meetings in a sheltered setting provide different food for thought and helpful solutions through an open collegiate dialogue.
