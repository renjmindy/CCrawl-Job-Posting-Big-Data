 Announcement …. "'Tis The Season … "

 ON A LIGHTER NOTE 
 
 I'm going to be away from this spot, "  It Is What It Is  ", for a few days. I won't have full access to a PC or laptop. 
 I still have the capacity to keep an eye on what happens in the blogosphere while I'm away. 
 I'm not able to just disconnect, particularly with what is going on in our world at this time. 
 There are so many problems, issues, conflicts, injustices, bigotry, destruction, killing, wars ….. We need to stay informed and educated about "  happenings  ". 
 I will leave you today with a message. 
 As noted above, we won't find peace until we extend our circle of compassion to all living things, as Mr. Sweitzer noted. 
 **' Tis the season … ** 
 We are all in this together. Be kind to on another.

 On a day like today …. "Thirty five years ago … his life was taken"!!

 JOHN WINSTON LENNON 
 This day, 35 years ago, marks the passing of English singer 
and songwriter and former member of  The Beatles  , John Lennon. 
(Born John Winston Lennon; Oct. 9, 1940 – 8 Dec.19, 80) 
 _John Lennon was an English musician who gained worldwide fame as one of the members of the  Beatles  , for his subsequent solo career, and for his political activism and pacifism. _ 
 He was shot by "a deranged American gunman" (  I refuse to use his name  ) in the archway of the building where he lived,  The Dakota  , in New York City on 8 December 1980. 
 Lennon had just returned from Record Plant Studio with his wife, Yoko Ono. 
 After sustaining four fatal gunshot wounds, Lennon was pronounced dead on arrival at Roosevelt Hospital. He was 40 years old. 
 _At the hospital, it was stated that nobody could have lived for more than a few minutes after sustaining such injuries. Shortly after local news stations reported Lennon 's death, crowds gathered at Roosevelt Hospital and in front of the Dakota. _ 
 Lennon was cremated on 10 December 1980 at the Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York. The ashes were given to Ono, who chose not to hold a funeral for him.

 Something to think about …. “First they came … "!!

 SILENCE MAKES YOU AN ACCOMPLICE 
 
 Where's our Martin Niemöller? 
 This graph, presents a poem, which been shared plenty of times in the blogosphere. Please, allow me the opportunity to present it again. 
 I want to apply it to our present time. 
 I've seen it many times. 
 Every time it makes me think. 
 More so now, in view of the ugly turn in the road where American politics seem to be headed. 
 To me, the bottom line is that if you don't speak up for others who are somehow persecuted, eventually your turn will come and there will be no one to stand up for your when you are persecuted. 
 It's time to stand up and hold your ground. 
 
 ~MARTIN NIEMOLLER~ 
 Martin Niemöller  (1892–1984) was a prominent Protestant pastor who emerged as an outspoken public foe of Adolf Hitler and spent the last seven years of Nazi rule in concentration camps. 
 _The quotation stems from Niemöller 's lectures during the early postwar period. Different versions of the quotation exist. These can be attributed to the fact that Niemöller spoke extemporaneously and in a number of settings. _ 
 Much controversy surrounds the content of the poem as it has been printed in varying forms, referring to diverse groups such as Catholics, Jehovah's Witnesses, Jews, Trade Unionists, or Communists depending upon the version. Nonetheless his point was that Germans - in particular, he believed, the leaders of the Protestant churches - had been complicit through their silence in the Nazi imprisonment, persecution, and murder of millions of people.

 First he came for the Mexicans, then he came for the war heroes, then he came for African Americans, then he came for the immigrants, then he came for the Jews, then he came for the "gays" …. now he's coming for the Muslims. Maybe you can add someone else or he will continue adding groups. 
 Is anyone going to stand up to him?

 A MILLION YEARS AGO 
 
 It's no secret. 
 I've found a new love. 
 Her music moves me. 
 Her lyrics touch my heart. 
 I listen to her new CD over and over and over again. In my car, in my house, through my cell phone. All the songs have something special. Each one stands on its own. 
 Can't tell which one is the best but this is one of my many favorites. Enjoy.

 Adele Wows With "Million Years Ago" Live Performance On 'The Today Show' 
 Singer  Adele  doesn’t have a single day to rest in the first week of release of her new album “25”. 
 The  British diva  is continuing with her promotional tour across different TV shows in America. On November 25th, she attended NBC’s “  The Today Show  ” to offer a live performance of the super emotional guitar-driven ballad "Million Years Ago" from “25”, which by the way, if you haven’t heard, beat the N'SYNC record of most album sales in a single week in just three days. “25” sold 2.4 million copies from November 20th to November 23rd! 
 Crazy!

 THERE 'S MORE TO CHRISTMAS 
 
 There's more, much more to Christmas 
Than candle-light and cheer; 
It's the spirit of sweet friendship 
That brightens all the year; 
It's thoughtfulness and kindness, 
It's hope reborn again, 
For peace, for understanding 
And for goodwill to men!

 A dear blogger friend taught me this concept. 
 You can find Michelle here: http://mchelsmusings.wordpress.com/ 
 ~IN HER OWN WORDS~ 
 “  IOTD  ” is image of the day, a concept I came up with. I teach visual meditative therapy – or in easy terms – a mini mental holiday. For some people it is very difficult for them to get their image right. I post an image a day for people to use in their mini mental vacay. Some are serious, some are silly, and some are just beautiful!”

 To start the day …. “Emily Estefan …. All Grown Up and Ready to Follow in Mom's Musical Footsteps"!!

 EMILY ESTEFAN 
 
 I've followed this family since their early days in Miami. 
 I know their story and how Gloria came to be the main singer of Miami Sound Machine. The band became a huge hit in the Latin community. Then Gloria "  crossed over  " into the American mainstream music scene. 
 It was all then about Gloria. 
 I remember their hits, I have all the CD and concert videos. I couldn't forget the harrowing time of the bus crash, her fractured back, her rescue, her recovery, her rehab and her comeback … that blue dress singing "  Coming Out of the Dark " . 
 And the rest is history! 
 In their personal lives, they had  Nayib  and finally a daughter,  Emily . Her name honors her dad Emilio. 
 I've seen Emily dab here and there in music. She has it in her genes, her internal makeup and her talent has grown. 
 She has released an awesome video with an absolutely on target message. 
 Kudos, Emily! 
 Enjoy! 
 HortyRex© 
 
 They sure grow up so fast! 
 If you ask  Gloria Estefan  , it feels like yesterday when her daughter Emily was a baby backstage at her sold-out concerts. Fast-forward to today and the 21-year-old college sophomore is totally grown up and ready to rock out on her own. 
 
 "I always think about it as a double-edge sword," Emily shared on Today's show when asked about following the same career as her mom. "I don't even understand that saying because doesn't a sword have one edge?" 
 
 She continued, "But the reality is they're amazing golden footsteps to follow in so my biggest fear now is just being able to do the past justice." 
 
 "I know that must people I know believe in me for my talent and for what I stand for but there's always a doubt in my mind because there is no way of knowing when you are a descendant of the  Conga Queen ." 
 
 As her parents focus on their Broadway musical appropriately titled "  On Your Feet  ," Emily is ready to prove she herself can turn the beat around. And yes, she'll do it while wearing mama's clothes. 
 
 "When I want to go shopping, I just go to the warehouse and grab her clothes," Emily admitted while wearing Gloria's retro pants and T-shirt. As they like to say, like mother, like daughter.

 " F*CK TO BE" 
 Singer Emily Estefan, the Miami Beach daughter of Gloria and Emilio, on Thursday released a music video in which she expresses her point of view to a ‘sterile and ominous’ world:  F#ck To Be . 
 F#ck To Be  prominently focuses on male and female gender roles and stereotypes. 
 On November 3, Emily Estefan released her brand new video  F#ck To Be . The concept behind the video shows Emily discovering and noticing a world that it is not what she expected instead it is very sterile and ominous. 
 
 “There are two POVs in the video, it is either what I see or what the mirror sees. It is me against the mirror. The mirror being expectations that I carry of myself, or what people expect me to be. I’m combatting the mirror, “ says Estefan. 
 
 F#ck to Be  will be the first single from her forthcoming full length CD,  Take Whatever You Want . Emily wrote, recorded, produced and performed her full album at Fairy Light Studios (her own studio in her college apartment in Boston, MA). 
 
 “Many people think I am saying “F” everything or everything sucks, but that is not true. I go in and out of these very different looks in the video that I don’t necessarily like for myself, but that doesn’t mean that I frown upon them, it just means that it is not me” said Estefan.

 DRAWING ADELE 
 HEATHER ROONEY 
 I am a 22 year old illustrator specializing in photorealistic colored pencil and graphite drawings. 
 You can check out my drawing videos on YouTube! 
 
 Hello! 
 My name is Heather Rooney. 
 I am an illustrator specializing in photorealistic colored pencil and graphite drawings. 
 Since finding my passion for portrait and figure drawing in high school, I have developed a technique focusing on high attention to detail. I draw my inspiration from a broad range of cultural figures, such as sport athletes, media personalities and entertainment professionals. 
 With each illustration requiring many hours of work, ranging from 30 hours to 100+ hours, I share my process through time-lapse videos on my YouTube channel, which has generated over 60 million views from a global audience. 
 I received my B.A. in Studio Art at Emmanuel College, in the vibrant city of Boston, Massachusetts. I am now pursuing a career in illustration.

 FEELING THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT 
 Pocoyo  (Pocoyó in Spanish) is a Spanish pre-school animated television series created by Guillermo García Carsí, Luis Gallego and David Cantolla, and is a co-production between Spanish producer Zinkia Entertainment, Cosgrove-Hall Films and Granada International. 
 Two series have been produced, each consisting of 52 seven-minute episodes. English actor and comedian Stephen Fry narrates the English-language version and José María del Río narrates the Castilian Spanish version of the first two seasons, while Stephen Hughes narrates the third season, called  Let’s Go Pocoyo . 
 Set in a 3D space, with a plain white background and usually no backdrops, it is about Pocoyo, a 4-year-old boy, interacting with his friends Pato (a duck), Elly (an elephant) and Loula (a dog).

 A dear blogger friend taught me this concept.

 ~IN HER OWN WORDS~ 
 “  IOTD  ” is image of the day, a concept I came up with. I teach visual meditative therapy – or in easy terms – a mini mental holiday. For some people it is very difficult for them to get their image right. I post an image a day for people to use in their mini mental vacay. Some are serious, some are silly, and some are just beautiful!”

 REMEMBER WHEN? 
 Starbucks unveiled its new holiday design – a red cup with the green Starbucks logo – and sparked significant controversy due to its lack of Christmas symbols like reindeer and snowflakes. 
 Starbucks defended the blank holiday design as welcoming of people's different stories.

 How fickle are we as a society? 
 How short is our memory? 
 Is there an element of an attention span deficit? 
 I wonder. 
 At least, a young, extremely talented, young lady, HEATHER ROONEY, grasped the idea happily and worked her wonder art. 
 There's still hope, I think.

 Drawing on my Starbucks cup - Christmas edition! 
 
 I don’t mind the Starbucks cup being plain red this year - more room to decorate it with a design representing what Christmas means to me.

 I'm originally from Puerto Rico. I was born in Santurce and raised in Rio Piedras. I currently live in Florida - since 1999. I have a doctorate degree in Medicine; completed in 1976. My Internal Medicine specialty was completed in 1979. Worked for Puerto Rico's health system until 1985. At this time, I'm happily retired after working for the federal government for almost 28yrs. I also worked for the government of Puerto Rico from 1979 through 1985 .... for a total of almost 40 years as a physician. I want to offer any knowledge that I have to anyone "out there" who is interested. My views are liberal in almost every sense. My knowledge is "eclectic" - a bit of everything. Music and reading are my passion. Blogging has also become a very interesting endeavor. Metaphysical topics attract me. I'm interested in news - reporting human issues like injustice, discrimination and abuse - the "wrongly" affected. My intention is to bring this knowledge to an understandable level and to help anyone in need. I'm open to questions and will answer them to the best of my ability. Currently working on an enterprise whose main mission will be to bring peoples of all walks of life together. To be one .... since we ALL are ONE!! The future looks bright and promising!!!
