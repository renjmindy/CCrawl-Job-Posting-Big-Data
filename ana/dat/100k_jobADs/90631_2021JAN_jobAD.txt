 Saturday Movie Matinee: ObamaCare Is A Job Killer 
 February, 8, 2014  by  nicedeb

 WFB:  CBO: Obamacare is a Job Killer: 
 
 The president and his allies have taken to defending, indeed celebrating, this finding, by saying Obamacare will end the problem of “job lock” in which Americans work in order to pay for their health insurance, as opposed to not working and having other people, such as the taxpayers, pay for their health insurance instead.

 Doug Ross:  Powerful and frightening testimony on Obama intimidation : 
 
 Catherine, her husband, their company and her nonprofit, have been repeatedly targeted, first in frivolous lawsuits by the Texas Democratic Party (which the Democrats lost, every single one, but they didn’t care, because it cost about $1 million for Catherine to defend – money fortunately provided by others as they are not rich), then outrageous, unprecedented demands from the FBI, the IRS and the ATF. Watch her testimony and share it. 
 This administration is literally revealing itself to be a tyranny. We all need to wake up before it is too late if it is indeed not too late already. The IRS has now proposed a new regulation that can only be described as a despotic attempt to throttle free speech. If codified, this rule will make legal, the criminal suppression of conservative groups that they have been engaging in since 2010,  and continue to engage in.  Add your comments to the chorus of outrage rising across the land against this IRS proposed rule that will literally destroy free speech. Submissions may be sent electronically via the Federal eRulemaking Portal at  http://www.regulations.gov , please include this citation: IRS REG-134417-13.

 Sheriff Arpaio Opens 2nd Criminal Investigation:  Two Events May Happen: 
 
 
 (Feb. 7, 2014) — For the first time in more than two months, Maricopa County  Cold Case Posse  lead investigator Mike Zullo was a  guest  on Carl Gallups’ “  Freedom Friday  ” during the first hour which began at 5:00 p.m. EST/4:00 p.m. EST. 
 Gallups greeted Zullo by saying that he had been “immersed in alligators” since Zullo’s last appearance on the show in November of last year. Release of the audio of the interview is credited to  ORYR . 
 During the 8:35 segment, Zullo announced that Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio has opened a “second criminal investigation” relative to the investigation into the birth certificate image posted on the White House website in April 2011. 
 The posse began its investigation into the image in September 2011, which publicly declared on March 1, 2012 that it was a “computer-generated forgery.” 
 Zullo had announced in November that new information would be released in March, but today, he said that “more information” which is “very intense” has been gathered. Zullo added that because of the new information and second criminal investigation, there might be “two events” held in the future to discuss the two topics separately.

 U.S. Justice Department officials who filed a civil rights lawsuit against the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office say they'll question Sheriff Joe Arpaio and his former top aide next month. 
 The Justice Department says Arpaio's deposition is scheduled for March 11 and former aide David Hendershott's deposition is set for March 4.
