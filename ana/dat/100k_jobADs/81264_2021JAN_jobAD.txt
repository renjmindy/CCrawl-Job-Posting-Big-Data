 Final Rule Establishes Standards for H-2A Herder Jobs 
 October 17, 2015April 20, 2016  /  goswamiassociates 
 The Department of Labor announced a final rule this week regarding the employment of foreign workers in jobs related to the herding of livestock on the range. This includes the herding of sheep and goats. 
 The H-2A Herder Final Rule covers all jobs related to the herding or production of livestock on the range. Because of the scarcity of U.S. workers in such occupations, it has been difficult to set an appropriate minimum wage, leading to wage stagnation for nearly 20 years. This new rule sets standards for minimum wage for this subcategory of worker. 
 Under this rule, the monthly pay rate for all such occupations will use the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour and a 48-hour workweek. Beginning in 2017, the monthly pay rate will be adjusted annually based on the Employment Cost Index calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
