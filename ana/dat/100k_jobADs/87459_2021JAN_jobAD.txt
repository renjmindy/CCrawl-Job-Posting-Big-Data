 I'm Here for You: The Italian Job (2003) 
 Romantic Moment #6 
 
 The Italian Job (2003) 
 So many of you might find this a weird one to be on the list, but hey I have other films that are more action/adventure than chick flick/romance. Yeah, that's right! I did  Lord of the Rings:   The Two Towers  and  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II . 
 
 So  The Italian Job  is a heist film and a good remake of the 1969 film. Charlie (Mark Wahlberg) heads up a group of thieves, as he recently took over the reins from his father figure, mentor, and safecracker; John (Donald Sutherland). The rest of the group is the "transporter" Handsome Rob (Jason Statham)…I know I know… 
 
 Couldn't resist 
 the computer wiz, Lyle (Seth Green); explosives guy, Left Ear (Mos Def), and Steve (Edward Norton), whoI don't really know what his actual job is in the group. The team pulls off the heist of the century, millions of dollars in gold bricks. 
 The group then goes off to a random mountain top in Switzerland to celebrate. There they are betrayed by Steve. Now this was my first time watching this film, but I knew Steve was bad news. I mean its Edward Norton! When is he not some guy playing you? How can you trust him? I mean in  Fight Club  his other self is trying to blow up the world (and selling people soap bars made out of their own fat),  The Illusionist,  he's trying to make everyone think he can communicate with the dead;  The Hulk 2  , he turns into the Hulk; I don't think he plays anything that isn't trying to pull one over on you. Well there is  Frida  , I mean in that he is just a Rockefeller. 
 Anyways, so Steve turns on them, takes the money and kills them all. Or so he thinks. He actually only kills John and the rest survive. Charlie tracks Steve down and finds him in Hollywood. The team are ready to go after him, but need one thing, a new safecracker. He approaches Stella (Charlize Theron), John's daughter, and the best there is. 
 The team decide to take Steve down, (Is it sad that everytime I write that I think of this: 
 Anyways back to the plot. So Charlie is able to convince Stella to join in with his crew and the group begin making plans to get Steve. They do it similar to how they did the Italian job, hence the name, but with a twist. They are going to take ove L.A.'s traffic. It is an amazing film, and I strongly recommend it! 
 
 Most Romantic Moment 
 So the most romantic part of this film comes right after the team's first plan has been found out. Their first plan to steal the gold was fouled because Steve's neighbor was having a party. Stella had told Steve she would go out with him so that they would have an open window to get the gold, as she was planning on standing him up. She instead is forced to go on the date, where Steve figures out that she is John's daughter. He insults her and and goes on about how he killed her father. 
 Stella gets mad and leaves, while Charlie remains with the two having a standoff as to who is the tougher guy. Charlie becomes so angry he punches Steve out. Knocked out in one hit, YES! (That's not the romantic part) 
 So back in the hotel, Charlie comes to visit Stella. She cries about her dad's death and how he never really cared about her. Charlie tells her that it is a lie, that her father loved her. 
 
 Charlie Croker: Just because he was around me more doesn't mean he wasn't thinking about you all the time. 
 Stella Bridger: [Sniffling] It would be nice if it was true. 
 Charlie Croker: It is true. He always regretted not having been a good enough father to you, Stella. 
 Stella Bridger: How do you know that? 
 Charlie Croker: Because he told me. 
 
 Stella cries some more and Charlie just holds her, kissing her forehead. 
 
 
 So romantic! 
 So why is this so romantic? Well throughout the whole movie when Charlie is planning and completing a heist he shows very little emotion. Not that he speaks in monotone, but he just is trying to stay focused on the task at hand, as any mistake he makes could mean the end for his team. In this moment he allows himself to go off that path as he cares more for Stella's well-being than he does for revenge. It's so cute that he goes in and makes sure that she is okay and reassured of her father's love. To further the romance, he knows that she is extremely vulnerable and just kisses her on the forehead, not taking advantage of her like some other guys would have. Plus it makes the end scene when they are in Venice even cuter.
