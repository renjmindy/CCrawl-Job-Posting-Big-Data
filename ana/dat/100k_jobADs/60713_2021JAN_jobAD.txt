 In a perfect world, no one would still be falling for typing job scams. Alas, the world isn't perfect and people are losing money to typing scams and schemes everyday. 
 Just to see what was going on in the typing-scam world, I did a Google search and came across this site. There are many things I don't like about this site, but the one that stands out the most is the part that says,  " It has nothing to do with Clickbank and Google Adwords where your income depends on sales generated."  and yet the picture of the "Proof of Typing Earnings" is a Clickbank Sales Snapshot. If it doesn't have to do with Clickbank or sales, why is there a picture of Clickbank sales? 
 Another big red flag is  " This is NON-REFUNDABLE."  I wonder why? How many people are paying $33 only to find out they have to sell stuff to make money and then asking for their money back? 
 It also says: 
 
 • Generate $400 to $600 daily 
• Have a free-hand on your working time 
• Work from whatever location 
• Choose how you are paid 
• Be ensured of payment 
• Choose jobs from legitimate online typing jobs companies at anytime 
• Inexperienced individuals are welcome 
 
 Here's the truth, no company pays $400 to $600 for typing and certainly not for inexperienced typists. 
 I search work-at-home jobs every day, so I can tell you from experience that I never find legitimate typing jobs. The only jobs I find that require typing are transcription, which require skills and experience and don't pay $400 a day. 
 The Clickbank snapshot indicates to me that this program is selling you the names of companies that have affiliate programs (the sales page says it isn't hiring typists, but helping people find typing work). Affiliate marketing is a viable way to make money from home, but you don't want to learn through a company like this that uses deception to make you think its a typing job. Affiliate marketing has nothing to do with typing although it may involve typing (typing ads and articles to promote your affiliate program). If you want to learn affiliate marketing I recommend Rosalind Gardner's  Super Affiliate Handbook  or  Niche Blogging , which teaches how to use blogging to make affiliate income. 
 In the end, any job ad you see for "typing" should immediately raise red flags. And remember, never pay money to get hired. To learn more about scams, visit the  Scam Information  page at Work-At-Home Success.

 I have been receiving seemingly "better than true" offers from several differently named "firms / people" and at first I just about replied. 
I'm still being inundated, but recently noticed that they all come from "MTS Advertise OU, Punane 19-18 Estonia, 13611". 
Do you have any knowledge of this one?

 Hi Neville, I don't know of this program specifically, but I do know that you're not going to get a job through an email offer. Unless you belong to an email list that you trust, emails you get about working at home should be considered suspect. If you trust the sender of the email, you're most likely to get offers to buy educational products or join a business opportunity. If you're looking for a job, you need to apply as you would any other job. THEN you might get an email in response to your application. But employers are not emailing first…they don't have to in this economy. Finally, keep track of job applications you send in. There are people who are emailing stuff that makes it look like they're responding to your email or application, but it's a scam. So keep a list of the jobs you apply to so you can verify the email is legitimate.

 Hi there. 
 I'm not sure if you are still available, but I will email and ask you these questions anyway. 
 I am interested in typing from home part time and was looking for leads on the internet. The first thing I always do is check for scams. 
 How do I find legitimate typing work? Are there no legitimate companies that outsource typing of materials such as instruction manuals, etc? 
 Can you provide any leads? 
 Thank You, 
 Ann Malone

 Hi Ann, I don't find many legitimate typing jobs. The best resources for this type of work are the freelance and  microwork  sites.
