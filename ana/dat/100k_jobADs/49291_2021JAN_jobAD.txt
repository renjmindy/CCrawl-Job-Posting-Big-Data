 ​Theatre Nurse / Scrubs Nurse / Recovery Nurse Jobs 
 Role overview 
 Theatre nurses work with patients of all ages and primarily within hospital operating theatres and anaesthetic/recovery areas. They may also be involved with certain procedures on wards, clinics or in other specialist areas such as cardiac catheterisation units. 
 Preoperative phase 
 During the preoperative assessment, you’ll make sure a patient is fully informed about the risks and benefits of the operation and that that they are in a good state of health for surgery. You’ll provide information about the operation and give the patient the opportunity to ask questions. This also reduces the risk of a late cancellation and resources being wasted. 
 Anaesthetic phase 
 During this phase, you’ll primarily support the anaesthetist but also prepare any specialist equipment, devices and drugs. You’ll also assess the patient immediately prior to the surgery. 
 Surgical phase 
 You’ll be responsible for a number of roles during the surgical phase including: 
 
 
 preparing all the necessary complex instruments and equipment including microscopes,lasers and endoscopes 
 
 
 working with the surgeon to provide instruments, needles, swabs and other materials as required 
 
 
 responsibility for the surgical instruments, equipment and swabs 
 
 
 act as a link between the surgical team and other parts of the theatre and hospital. 
 
 
 Recovery phase 
 Following the operation, you’ll: 
 
 
 offer the patient care and support upon arrival on the post anaesthetic care unit 
 
 
 monitor the patient's health 
 
 
 providing appropriate care and treatment until the patient has recovered from the effects of the anaesthesia and/or surgery 
 
 
 assess the patient to ensure they can be discharged back to a ward 
 
 
 assess the care given during each of the perioperative phases
