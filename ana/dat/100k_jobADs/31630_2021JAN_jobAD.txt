 Professional Development for Personality Dimensions Trainers 
 A few months ago I was catching up with  Sandra Summerhayes  and she mentioned that she had just finished a great Personality Dimensions… online! At that point we had been kept very busy answering some often frantic "how do " calls from Personality Dimensions facilitators. Sandra mentioned that she was thinking about putting something together to help facilitators take their training online, and asked when we thought she should start offering it. My immediate thought was "yesterday!" Because this workshop is designed to address the very issue we had been getting calls about, I thought I’d share this information. 
 Since then, Sandra has offered this workshop many times to sold-out audiences. I just checked with her to see how registration for the September  Delivering PD in the Virtual World  workshop is going and was surprised to learn that there are still a small handful of spaces available. 
 As John Maxwell once said ‘Change is inevitable. Growth is optional.’ As Personality Dimensions facilitators adapting to the new normal, (whatever that’s going to become) this growth opportunity lies in taking the original Personality Dimensions content and adapting it to an ever-evolving virtual landscape. The content remains the same, the delivery method is changing.
