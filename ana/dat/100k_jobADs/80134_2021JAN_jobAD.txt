 Hi! my name is Jasmine, I am a teacher by profession and have worked as a nanny for American family in Dubai for 5 years. My job includes looking after a baby (when the youngest was still a baby but he is 4 yrs old now) and helping the 3 older kids with their activities when needed such as helping them with their homeworks, school projects and accompanying them to their after school activities . and cooking for the family. I also traveled with them to different countries whenever they required me to.But now I'm back here in the Phil. and I'm looking for a caregiver job in Canada or Europe. 
I just want to know if I would be considered as applicant for caregiver position even though I don't have a caregiver certificate. 
Thank you so much and more power to you!
