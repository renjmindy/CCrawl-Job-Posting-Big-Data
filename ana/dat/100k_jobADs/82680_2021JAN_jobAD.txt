 Business travel  can be stressful. 
 You have enough to worry about simply attempting to adapt to working outside of the office. 
 Youâ€™ll be spending a lot more time with your coworkers than usual, and this can make for some awkward situations. 
 The most awkward of all situations will likely be your away-from-the-office relationship with your boss. 
 Itâ€™s a tricky social landscape to navigate, and it may not be clear exactly how you should handle certain situations. Developing an  etiquette  code for yourself ahead of time will keep most surprises from popping up. 
 1. Have a Financial Plan 
 Talking about money can create some unpleasant situations. Before you head out, understand how the business is covering your travel expenses. 
 Keep your company credit card handy, and know when youâ€™re supposed to use it. Make sure you take the right amount of cards and cash to handle your personal expenses, and also be sure you understand what things are considered personal expenses rather than  business expenses . 
 The business may cover more than you think, and you need to be sure you understand the budget. 
 2. When in Doubt, Mimic 
 If youâ€™re ever unsure of what you should do, it helps to play follow the leader. If  your boss  is content with relaxing during certain times, itâ€™s probably okay for you to do the same. 
 No one will be as rigid as they are around the office, but thereâ€™s still an unspoken code of conduct to follow. Be ready to shift things around according to your bossâ€™ schedule. 
 3. Dress for Success 
 Work travel is not a vacation. Your boss isnâ€™t going to walk around in cargo shorts and a tank top, and you shouldnâ€™t either. 
 When packing, go for  business casual . Street clothes are a no-no in nearly every situation youâ€™ll encounter away from the office. Itâ€™s okay to dress comfortably, but thereâ€™s a difference between comfortable clothing and leisure clothing. 
 4. Watch the Alcohol 
 You may enjoy a glass of wine with your dinner, and thatâ€™s fine. If your boss doesnâ€™t, you might want to enjoy that wine in private. 
 Most bosses will generally be accepting of a beer at a business dinner, but  limit yourself  to one. Your boss will probably understand having a beer or a cocktail to take the edge off of a long business day, but he or she wonâ€™t be nearly as understanding if you get drunk in a business setting. 
 5. Prepare to be Independent 
 Everyone will want breaks from each other, and that space will make the trip easier. Donâ€™t expect that youâ€™re going to have every meal and run every errand together. 
 There will be times where everyone is left to fend for themselves, and you should enjoy the  peace  and quiet. 
 6. Know What Youâ€™re Responsible For 
 Everyone will play their own roles during a business trip. Responsibilities are delegated to avoid the burden of everything being placed on one personâ€™s shoulder. 
 There are some things youâ€™ll be responsible for that pertain to the entire group (such as meal reservations) and things youâ€™ll need to arrange yourself (such as getting a rental car). Showing up unprepared leaves a lasting negative  impression . 
 If you have anything youâ€™re unsure of, clarify it before the flight is booked. Your boss would rather answer questions than help you fix a mistake. 
 -- 
 Your boss can be using this trip to evaluate your  performance  in a variety of situations. If you perform just as well away as you do at home, this could boost his or her opinion of you as an employee. 
 If you want a bright future with your company, make sure youâ€™re on your best behavior during any trips you may take.

 Thanks for the awesome advice. 
 There is a small mistake in the article. Instead of #6 you wrote #7 after #5 
"7. Know What Youâ€™re Responsible For"
