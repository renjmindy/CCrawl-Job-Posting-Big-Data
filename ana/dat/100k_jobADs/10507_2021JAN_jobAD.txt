 Why we 're looking for a General Manager…

Together, they have worked tirelessly to grow Helical Levity, alongside various other businesses. We're now in a position to look for someone to share these responsibilities, to ultimately reduce the burden on our two very busy Executives. 
 Our company is made up of four main teams: technology; product; marketing and operations. We need someone with the experience to oversee all project and programme deliverables, to ensure all aspects of the business are running smoothly. 
 About you … 
 We're looking for an enthusiastic and results driven General Manager, who will be instrumental in advancing Helical Levity to their next stage of success. The right person will be responsible for all client management, ensuring that new and existing programmes, projects and products are rolled out successfully and within budget. Alongside this, they will direct and manage our organisation's business activities, whilst developing and implementing effective business strategies.

 Be passionate about the development of our people. 
 Be extremely detail orientated. 
 Have experience being the client facing voice. 
 Have experience creating and managing project budgets. 
 Have good knowledge of different business functions. 
 Have experience researching and identifying growth opportunities to improve revenue. 
 
 About us … 
 Our team combines passionate and talented designers, developers and security researchers. Together we design and build the industry leading cyber security education product, CyberStart, used by over 200k students across the UK and US. The product, built mainly for young adults, is an engaging cyber security game where students take on the role of an agent in the cyber protection agency. Through this, they learn by hacking, forensicate and code break their way through levels filled with rich narrative, immersive design and realistic security labs. 
 We are a small business, with under 30 employees, but we've retained our start up mentality we had back in 2015. As much of our team work remotely, culture is really important to us and you can sometimes find us escaping from a zombie, swinging through trees and constructing our own gingerbread empires! 
 We have an amazing, open plan office in Ascott-under-Wychwood, on the Cornbury Park Estate in Oxfordshire. We have an onsite gym, a fully stocked fridge and countryside walks on our doorstep. Although the GM position is not required to be based full time in the office, being in a commutable distance from the office is essential, as you will be required to have regular meetings with the teams. 
 Level and salary: 
 Our ideal candidate will have a degree in Business Management, MBA or equivalent industry experience. 
 Experience working in cyber security is preferable but not required. 
 Salary is negotiable based on experience. 
 
 Company benefits include: 
 
 Private healthcare 
 Flexible working 
 High spec hardware 
 28 days holiday plus bank holidays 
 Regular team "get togethers" - virtual and in person! 
 Scope to attend industry events 
 Fantastic training and development opportunities 
 Free eye-tests
