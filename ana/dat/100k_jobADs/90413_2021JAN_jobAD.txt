 STILL Waiting for Job Offer To Be Approved! 
 By  Ronnie Ann   246 Comments 
 Hello Ronnie Ann. It's been nice to read all the advice you have given. Still waiting for job offer to be officially approved seems to be the worst waiting game for many of your readers. And now I am in the same boat. 
 Here's my story. I flew in for a the job interview on July 7. And it went very well. My contact there (the hiring manager) tells me that I'm their top candidate. So now we are all waiting for job offer to get the final sign-offs. 
 About a week later, the hiring manager called and said that he put something together for me that should be a good territory. And it just has to be signed off on. I spoke to him the week after, and he said it is now in financing to be approved. So for now it has been two weeks and still nothing official. 
 Waiting for job offer is so slooow! 
 I spoke to my contact again on Monday, and he said that he is still waiting for it to be approved, But once again, he assured me that I am still ‚Äútheir guy‚Äù. This has me wondering. Do you think that I have anything to worry about? 
 It seems like things are going pretty slow. Especially after how quick they flew me in to interview, from when I submitted my resume. That only took 2 weeks. 
 Another question I had is, how often should you contact the hiring manager to inquire about the progress? One thing I don't want to be is annoying to them.

 And here's my response ‚Ä¶ 
 Hi David, 
 As far as I can tell from what you wrote, all is on track. Internal processes can take weeks -- often much longer than the whole initial interview process. Nothing's for sure of course, but things look good. So relax, have faith, and find something to do in the meantime. Maybe a project or something you want to learn -- or anything to keep your brain occupied!

 As for how often to contact the hiring manager ‚Ä¶ there's no hard and fast rule. In your specific situation, you might send him an e-mail toward the end of next week. Just let him know you're still interested, and ask if there's anything more you need to do. 
 Truth is, at this point they know who you are, so unless you get another offer, give them some time. I once waited about 5 months to find out I was the top candidate. And I only e-mailed them every now and then. üôÇ 
 Good luck! Please let us know what happens.

 Dear Work Coach, 
 I could use your insight to a current frustrating situation. 
 At the end of July, I had two great interviews and a lunch meeting with the CEO and SVP of a small marketing firm. I received an email from both on August 1st that I was the ideal candidate and would be receiving a formal offer in 24 hours. The offer didn't come for 4 days and it did not include a bonus structure. When I spoke with the CEO to review his offer, I informed him of my salary history, he apologized for the low offer and promised to send an amended offer with a bonus structure in 48 hours. I did not receive a new proposal for 8 days. This proposal included a bonus plan and an explanation that they were simply could not afford to match my salary history and market value for this executive position, and offered only a 4% salary increase to their original offer. When I spoke with the CEO to review, I asked if he would be flexible to meeting me in the middle from his current offer and my current salary‚Ä¶.he agreed and said we had a deal and would have a formal offer to me by the end of the day. That was over two weeks ago and there has been no formal offer or any contact from him since. The CEO was on vacation last week, so I sent an email to the SVP touching base, explaining that the CEO and I had come to terms, had discussed a potential start date and kindly asked for any insight with the delay‚Ä¶the SVP did respond: "there was not yet an agreement but he (CEO) was still in the process of analyzing the financials to see if he could hit a compensation package that would be comfortable for both parties" and that he would inform the CEO that we had communicated. That was over a week ago and the CEO has been back from vacation this week, with no courtesy response or formal offer sent, since our mutual verbal agreement on August 17th. 
 I'm not sure what next steps to take? I am still interested in the position and the company but their inconsistent communication seems unusual, unprofessional and could be a red-flag for poor business practices. I'd appreciate your valuable input?

 Hi Renee! 
 This is a holiday weekend coming up and things slow down around this time as people go on vacation. Also‚Ä¶many things come up that can delay the hiring process that have nothing to do with the candidate. Approvals - especially if people are on vacation - can take longer than you might imagine. 
 At this point, you've done all you can and it sounds very hopeful. Hard as it is, let it go for now. Have a good weekend and expect some word by the end of NEXT week, to give people time to get back to the office and their overflowing inboxes. üòâ 
 Good luck!!

 Dear Job Coach, 
 I received a phone call from a recruiter who works for a large IT company at the end of July. After two more phone interviews and two weeks later, the company flew me out for a face-to-face interview. 
 The following week (after the interview) I received an email from my recruiter stating that I had done really well in my interview and that she was working on approvals and would have more information for the early next week. Well Monday and Tuesday come and go. Tuesday night I emailed her asking how if she had any new information with the status of my application. She quickly replied and said that she had not yet heard anything but hopefully will have approvals by Friday or Monday. 
 Today I received another email saying, "We are waiting to see if we get approvals. I should know more early next week." 
 What does all this mean? Is this a delay tactic to keep me around, but yet gives them enough time to interview other candidates? Or are they really waiting for some kind of salary approval?
