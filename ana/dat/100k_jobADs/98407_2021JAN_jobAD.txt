 It doesn't matter if you're a business owner, a career seeker, or neither, you need to have this

 Greetings! 
 Did you know LinkedIn is a business social network not just for business owners, career seekers, and business professionals? But, for employers and recruiters as well? 
 If you're looking to change careers or are in between jobs, 3 million jobs are listed on LinkedIn and 122 million people received an interview from their LinkedIn profile. 
 So, what you think if you're not a career seeker, did you know LinkedIn is the #1 B2B (business to business) marketing channel used to distribute content at 94%? 
91% of marketing executives list LinkedIn as the top place to find quality content. 
 It's important to update and review your LinkedIn profile regularly, and having it be complete because it tells the world that you're open for business and open for jobs. You want to write a headline that is attention grabbing, but also is concise and supports the professional brand you're building. 
 According to LinkedIn's Marketing Solutions blog, in an article dated July 5, 2018, there are over 546 million users on LinkedIn. That's why it's important to make incremental updates to your LinkedIn profile. 
 Did you know that LinkedIn profiles with professional head shots receive 14 times more profile views and 36 times more messages? 
 You can also increase your profile views on LinkedIn by 13 times if you list skills on your LinkedIn profile. 
 Here are the 5 things recruiters look at on your LinkedIn profile: 
 A. Your headline right below your name. If you don't say what you do, they will skip right past you, for example, if you want to get hired into software development jobs, you won't choose the LinkedIn profile "Results-oriented professional." 
 If you do, most recruiters will skip right past your profile even if they'd conducted a keyword search on the most common software-development terms and your profile looked like a match. That's where the importance of hiring a LinkedIn Consultant, such as myself, to write/edit your existing headline to make it attention grabbing and clear to stand out from the millions of other LinkedIn profiles out there. 
 B. Your LinkedIn summary is right below your headline. Don't sound robotic and use phrases that everyone else uses. It's important to tell why you do what you do (the story), not list off boring stats such as "10 years sales experience, 5 years security, etc.") That's where the importance of hiring a LinkedIn Consultant, such as myself, to interview you and write your story of why you do what you do in an interesting and engaging manner to stand out from the millions of other LinkedIn profiles out there. 
C. Your enhancements on LinkedIn (these are attachments of your pictures of you receiving awards, attachments of proud projects at current/previous jobs, links to your business and professional websites, videos, etc.) That's where the importance of hiring a LinkedIn Consultant, such as myself, to add these to your various areas on your LinkedIn profile. 
 D. The size of your network (the more connections you have), the easier you will be found on LinkedIn. That's where the importance of hiring a LinkedIn Consultant, such as myself, to maintain your LinkedIn profile for you monthly to add/respond/forward important messages to you and more [inquire about our monthly basic, standard, and deluxe packages OR set up a 30 minute phone consultation to chat about your LinkedIn needs and have a review of your LinkedIn profile prior with recommendations for $50]. 
 E. If you want to grow your network and have recruiters and employers notice you, write an update or a blog post. That's where the importance of hiring a LinkedIn Consultant, such as myself, to do this for you (if you don't want to, don't have the time to, or don't know how to) to maintain your LinkedIn profile for you monthly to write your updates and blogs for you and more [inquire about our monthly basic, standard, and deluxe packages OR set up a 30 minute phone consultation to chat about your LinkedIn needs and have a review of your LinkedIn profile prior with recommendations for $50]. 
 If you already know that you don't just want to consult and get tips on improving your LinkedIn profile and know you want to get a LinkedIn profile setup/revamped, then this package is for clients who do not have a LinkedIn profile OR for clients who want to update/review their existing LinkedIn profile. 
 This includes me completely filling out your LinkedIn profile which includes: writing or re-writing your summary, headline, filling out your entire job history, volunteer experience, causes you support, awards, letters of recommendations, samples of your work, video links, patents you have, publications you've been published in, I will upload a professional picture for you (if you have one), change your LinkedIn profile URL (website address) so that you're more easily found for business and jobs. I also fix any grammar, punctuation, spelling, and syntax errors in your LinkedIn profile all for a one time payment of $250. 
 Again, the setup/revamp package is only ONE of many packages or services I provide. I have marketing packages, training sessions, consultations, and maintenance packages that are outside of my setup/revamp package. 
 Contact me today for a free, no obligation 10 minute phone call for yourself or your referral(s), OR to setup a LinkedIn consultation with me by visiting my website:  http://www.worksolutionstoday.com/consultation.html  and downloading the 4 question LinkedIn form and emailing it back to me, OR by emailing or calling me to inform me you'd like to purchase the setup/revamp package for yourself or someone else. 
 REMEMBER: It doesn't matter if you're a business owner, a CEO at a company, working a part time gig, a career seeker/changer, or a business professional in general, you NEED to be on LinkedIn and NOT just when you need a job or business, you need to regularly be maintaining a social business network (just like you regularly save for retirement and other things so you can have it come that time), you need to have a LinkedIn profile updated and ready to go so you can constantly be ready to receive job offers, business, and networking.
