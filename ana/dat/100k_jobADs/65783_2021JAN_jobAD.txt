 ‚ÄúCome help us build the digitisation platform powering successful businesses across Europe.‚Äù 
 Role overview 
 ‚ÄúCome help us build the digitisation platform powering successful businesses across Europe.‚Äù 
 Jonathan Jouty, eID Team Lead 
 JOB DESCRIPTION 
 At Scrive you will work in a fast and innovative environment and you will join an entrepreneurial and great-positioned company, growing at an exciting pace. Our aim is, that a few years from now, you will be able to say; ‚ÄúWe did that, I was a part of the Scrive Story.‚Äù 
 For us to keep on delivering the best product on the market and always be a step ahead on new features we will now strengthen our Platform Engineering team with a Haskell Developer. We believe that the person that we are looking for wants to conquer the world and defeat the old, slow giants of enterprise software. 
 We have several backend services written in Haskell using Servant and Happstack, interfacing to PostgreSQL using the hpqtypes library, and using the consumers library for managing jobs and queues. We have a dedicated frontend team for larger projects, but the Platform Engineering team also maintains a legacy React application, along with a minimal frontend and demo application written in Elm for some newer parts. Our code is pragmatic and uses language features that solve business needs, we don‚Äôt have rules on what can and cannot be used, as long as it satisfies a practical need. 
 You will join one of our backend teams, either focusing on our eID Hub, or the rest of our Platform. Rotating between teams is encouraged. Our teams are currently small and you will directly contribute to the continuous and iterative improvement of the code quality, tests, system monitoring and all other areas of the system. 
 The position is remote, available to anyone living in the EU, but if you are located in Stockholm you can also come to work at our wonderful HQ office in central Stockholm (subject to Covid-19 restrictions, of course). In this role you will report to your team lead and the Head of Platform. 
 JOB DUTIES 
 As Haskell Developer within Platform Engineering you will be responsible for maintaining and developing new features and integrations. You will contribute to the quality of the product by participating in code reviews, testing new features, reproducing bug reports and fixing bugs. 
 What you will do: 
 
 Develop code for the one of the Platform Engineering teams using pragmatic Haskell, Elm, PostgreSQL, and when required React and JavaScript or any other technologies. 
 Participate constructively in the collaborative code review process 
 Deploy new releases 
 Participate in identifying system problems and incident management 
 Contribute to the improvement of internal processes (regarding everything from development, product backlog, deployment,  etc.  ) 
 
 WHO ARE YOU? 
 To succeed in the role as a Haskell Developer, we expect you to meet the following minimum qualifications: 
 
 Minimum two years experience in Haskell either from personal or commercial use 
 Has an understanding of the current best practices for writing production quality code 
 Knows how to optimise Haskell code for performance 
 Fluent in English, both written and spoken 
 Contribute to the success of the Platform Engineering team and product, through good engineering practices, constructive teamwork, and a supportive team environment. 
 
 Big bonus points if you have previous experience of: 
 
 Being a computer language polyglot - the more languages and frameworks you are comfortable with, the better 
 High growth start up or scale up environment 
 Working remotely 
 
 To succeed in the role as Haskell Developer in the Platform Engineering team we will need you to be  self-reliant . You are able to independently choose work methods and make necessary decisions to drive work forward, also when there are no given routines or guidance. You will join a small team that works closely together so it will be crucial for you to be highly  co-operative . Where you pay attention to others opinions, competence and performance and make an effort to adjust your own behaviour in order to create good working relationships with others. This role is all about finding and delivering the best solution, therefore you need to be  solution oriented  , you have the ability to break down problems, do an analysis and take action to prevent problems and find the best solution. Scrive is in a growing phase where we are moving fast forward, this means that your prioritized list could change quickly. We therefore believe that you are a  flexible  person that quickly adjusts to new circumstances.
