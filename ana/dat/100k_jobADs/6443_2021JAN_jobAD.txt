 Early Career Workshop 
 2014/09/01   Shen-yi Liao 
 One of the goals of the Experimental Philosophical Aesthetics project is to facilitate the transfers of knowledge and skills between researchers of diverse backgrounds. We think promoting works of early career researchers is an effective way to accomplish that goal.
