 Leveraging Open Banking data to remove the bias in credit scoring 💳 
 Role overview 
 We're looking for a Senior Data Engineer to join our team in London. The role will have a broad remit but your goal would be to improve our culture, processes and posture with respect to data throughout the business 📈. 
 Working closely with the CTO and the Platforms team, you'll be responsible for building out, monitoring and improving solutions to a whole host of data related challenges we face as a business 📊. From maintaining a secure research environment and enhancing our privacy controls to building tools to track overall company and platform performance, right down to the detail, you'll be the one driving 🚙. 
 You'll be shaping a new class of credit bureau; one with significant customer involvement and one that's focussed on promoting and rewarding good financial behaviour, for the benefit for the whole financial sector 👍. This, like all our other positions, is a deeply ethical role; many of the decisions made on a daily basis impact lives in very real ways and we want somebody to think carefully and feel passionately about that 💛. 
 Our team has a diverse background 
 Not everyone studied Computer Science here, and we have at least one classically trained opera singer 🎤. We have people with backgrounds in massive companies, small companies, and some for whom this is their first job. We're looking for people who want to learn and grow as much as lead and teach 📚. If that sounds like you, we'd love to hear from you! 
 Your Profile 
 
 In your work, you live and breathe data 📊. 
 You know what a strong culture of data driven decisions means for a company's growth, having built tools to achieve that before ⚙️. 
 You know what it takes to build market-leading products in a fast-paced start up environment, and you've been doing so for 5+ years 💻 
 You've experience working in a B2B setting, ideally in fintech and/or lending 💸. 
 You've built and lead products/initiatives from nothing, with a keen focus on metrics and impact 📈. 
 You're deeply driven to make the financial world fairer and more responsible 💳. 
 You're happy when fluently translating between technical and non-technical stakeholders, and love jointly getting stuck in to difficult problems 🧠.

 Credit Kudos is a venture-backed fintech startup and challenger credit bureau that uses financial behaviour to measure creditworthiness. 💳 Our technology transforms the way credit checking and credit scores work by generating a more accurate and holistic view of a borrower's creditworthiness. We’re working with lenders to help them make better, fairer credit decisions and with consumers to help them access fair, affordable credit. ⚖️ Our mission is to transform the credit scoring system to provide fairer credit for all; helping people access responsible finance they can afford, when they need it. 🤝 How it all began: After working in the US for a number of years, Freddy returned to the UK ✈️. Having had no recent financial activity in the UK, he had a 'thin' credit file. This not only meant that he had limited credit options, but those that were available to him came with higher interest rates and restrictions 🙁. After further research it became apparent that he was not alone, and that many people in the UK face difficulties when trying to get access to affordable credit 💳. With a vision to remove that challenge from the market, Freddy and Matt founded Credit Kudos 👋. Since then, the team at Credit Kudos have been on a mission to provide fair credit for all, harnessing the power of Open Banking 🌍. We’re building a credit bureau the right way - with the customer involved and transparent throughout. We’re looking for talented and creative engineers who share our vision. 🚀
