 Our Manifesto 
 We are breathing new life into an industry that is failing those it serves. We are creating an unparalleled, cohesive, and personalized healthcare experience. 
 We stand for immediate access to the highest quality of care, for any medical problem, anytime, anywhere in the world. 
 We are forging a new path for delivering healthcare, one that demands clinical excellence, advancing care through the use of technology, and is accountable to one party only: the patient. 
 We practice with honor, empathy, kindness, and grit. We aren’t advisors—we are real providers and tireless advocates. We own our member’s healthcare journey, walking alongside them and staying actively involved until (and after) the problem is solved. 
 Our Mission 
 To provide our members with a first-class, on-demand, comprehensive healthcare experience anytime, anywhere. 
 Our Purpose 
 To design and deliver the best medical care. 
 Our Values 
 Honor 
 Live and work with respect and integrity. 
 Courage 
 Stand for what is right and calmly face adversity. 
 Kindness 
 Be compassionate and seek to understand. 
 Curiosity 
 The passion to learn, create, and when necessary, invent.
