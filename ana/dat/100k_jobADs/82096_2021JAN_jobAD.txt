 Overcoming the First Barrier to Change 
 December 29, 2017 
 Tell me there has been a time in your life when you desperately wanted change, but doing it wasn't so easy. It actually happens to me quite often. As much as I love change, sometimes it's hard for me to get it going. I was recently reminded of my habit to resist change, as my …  More Overcoming the First Barrier to Change

 Shifting into Abundance 
 December 11, 2017 
 What is your #1 barrier to creating the change you really want? People often place money at the top of that list. I'd agree that I believed it to be my biggest obstacle when I was stuck in dentistry. But I wonder… is that really what's holding us back? While it seems obvious that money …  More Shifting into Abundance

 How to Get Out of Your Own Head 
 November 14, 2017 
 Life loves to test us with different challenges, doesn't it? It happens every day. Sometimes we roll with it and don't even notice, and other times it really throws us for a loop. Recently I got caught up in one of life's little tests. A few weeks ago, I was at a stop sign turning …  More How to Get Out of Your Own Head

 Wherever You Go, There You Are 
 October 19, 2017 
 I recently had very similar discussions with a current client and a prospective client. They both know they need to change something in their careers. One has a strong sense of what she'd like to do next, and the other just knows she doesn't want to continue in her field anymore. What they share in …  More Wherever You Go, There You Are

 When Quitting Isn't the Easy Way Out 
 September 27, 2017 
 How do you know when it's time to throw in the towel? As football season is back upon us, I'm going to talk about some old news. It was 8 months ago that we watched the Patriots pull out the ultimate comeback. It was so inspiring. They were so far behind, a win seemed impossible. …  More When Quitting Isn't the Easy Way Out

 Understanding the Single-Minded Nature of Dentists 
 September 8, 2017 
 In my last post, a Lolabees Friend shared a wonderfully thoughtful comment that got me thinking about a lot of things. One thing in particular stood out. At the close, he said: All I can say at this moment — 4 weeks after taking a break from dentistry — is that just now I am …  More Understanding the Single-Minded Nature of Dentists

 Can Coming Out of the Closet Change the World? 
 August 22, 2017 
 There's an interesting cultural phenomenon that happens in dentistry, and I wonder if it happens in other fields. There is an unspoken rule that we all have to love our jobs and have to constantly show the rest of the world how happy and successful we are. It's a lot of pressure, especially when some …  More Can Coming Out of the Closet Change the World?

 If you're looking for more inspiration to create what you want out of your career, here is a fantastic article about women who have changed careers after age 30.

 Facing the Unknown 
 July 27, 2017 
 Woody Allen once said, "If you want to make God laugh, tell him about your plans." I guess God was laughing at me last weekend because my big plan didn't work out. I'm very lucky that I live in a place where I can hop in the car and arrive at some of the most …  More Facing the Unknown
