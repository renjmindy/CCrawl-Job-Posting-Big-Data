 Role overview 
 We are looking for full-stack software engineers with a passion for building complex web applications.

 Quantemplate is a self-service data management and analytics platform, initially targeted at the needs of the insurance market.

 Make it faster and able to handle increasingly vast quantities of data 
 Continually improve usability and responsiveness, making it the most intuitive and easy to use data platform in existence. 
 Improve our development and deployment processes, creating a platform that is a joy to develop against.

The candidates will be required to work full time at our office in the heart of Londonâ€™s vibrant Shoreditch. Remuneration is at the top end of the spectrum for the qualification level as we reward talent and expect high quality results.
