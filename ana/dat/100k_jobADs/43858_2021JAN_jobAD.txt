 Juice Programmer 
 Triband Apply for this Job 
 Posted 
 December 27, 2020 
 Full Time 
 Copenhagen, DK 
 Remote 
 If you thrive collaborating with both designers and programmers to implement the juiciest interfaces 🧃, effects and game feel and by using C# and Unity skills to bring that extra life to the game. 
 Then come join the team behind WHAT THE GOLF? and play with us on our upcoming next big project. 🍌� 
 ‍ 
 ‍ 
 WHAT YOU WILL DO: UI, juice, and game feel  ‍ 
 As a Juice programmer with a focus on UI, you will be part of the team behind our unannounced new game. Your main responsibility will be building and maintaining consistent UI across the game. 
 This is amongst other things: menus, speech bubbles, localized texts, but also juicy pop-ups and of course lots of gameplay effects and particles. This happens in close collaboration with a UX designer, 2D artist, and basically, everyone else as UI is touching all parts of the game. 
 
 Implement a cohesive UI experience through the game 
 Implement game feel related juice and effects in gameplay 
 Collaborate on UX design in Figma (our UI mockup tool of choice) 
 Work closely with designers and programmers on how to make everything fit together 
 Explore ideas and come up with new smart things we hadn’t yet thought of 
 
 ‍ 
 WHAT YOU WILL ALSO DO: Help out and explore your own ideas  ‍ 
 Everyone has a main responsibility (this), but we also make time to explore other things. Maybe you are interested in playing with that new physics feature or try making that wacky level idea you came up with. We encourage people to learn new things and just help each other out across projects and teams. 
 REQUIREMENTS: 
 
 You prioritize the user experience and how things feel, not just how they work 
 Proficiency in C# and programming in Unity 
 You’ve worked with Unity UI canvas or equivalent UI frameworks 
 3+ years of experience and having shipped games in larger teams  ‍ 
 
 ‍ 
 REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY JOB OPENING AT TRIBAND: 
 
 
 You thrive taking ownership of your own area. You can spot problems, ask for advice when in doubt, and implement your own solution 
 
 
 You actively support a culture of collaboration, mutual respect, inclusiveness, and creativity 
 
 
 A great working environment is important for you and you help out around you 
 
 
 Team production experience, such as using git, branching, stand-ups, sprints, reviews 
 
 
 ‍ 
 PRACTICALITIES: 
 
 37 hours work week with options for flexible schedules 
 No crunch: People over deadlines 
 Lunch included (also vegetarian/vegan options) 
 Paid parental leave 
 Competitive salary 
 
 ‍ 
 And a few notes on how we work: 
 
 We experiment a lot and it doesn’t always work out, but we always learn something 
 Everyone at the studio is hands-on and part of making things 
 You are part of defining and prioritizing your own tasks 
 You get to be part of shaping new projects and the studio 
 We explore and try to push the boundaries of what comedy can do in games 
 Working in 14-day sprints in close-knit teams of ~6 people from different skill areas  ‍ 
 
 ‍ 
 DEADLINE AND START:  ‍ 
 As soon as possible, but we will wait for the right candidate. 
 While we currently work remote and the job would start out fully remote, we will be returning to our office at some point, so you need to be in or up for coming to Copenhagen, Denmark. We can of course help with that.  ‍ 
 ‍ 
 WHAT THE TRIBAND?  ‍ 
 We want to make people laugh! We do it by making comedy games, being original, and taking chances. We recently launched WHAT THE GOLF? - a golf game for people who hate golf? 
 All jobs involve experiments, bad jokes, stupid ideas, silly physics, and failed prototypes. We work in Unity and almost everyone works in-editor and very hands-on, also if you do design, audio, or animation. 
 We are currently ~20 people of 6 different nationalities and the language is English. We put the people first and strive to create a great working environment and are generally looking for people who are not like us and who will challenge us and our way of doing things! 
 We believe that teams make games, not individuals - and we believe diversity makes for better teams. That's why we look for people who make the team better, instead of just who’s got the most experience. 
 We are primarily looking for people with at least 2+ years of game dev experience but will be opening up more entry-level positions in the future.

 ABOUT WHAT THE GOLF? 
 A silly physics-based golf parody where every golf course is a new surprising type of golf, some brilliant or hilarious, others so absurd they will make you go: WHAT THE GOLF?
