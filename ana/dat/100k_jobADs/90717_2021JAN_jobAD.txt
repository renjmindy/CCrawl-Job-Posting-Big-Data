 Strong management and matrix management experience 
 Strong background formulating customer proposals 
 Track record of designing, architecting and delivery of complex enterprise solutions 
 Proven solution architecture expertise 
 Proven stakeholder management skills to executive level 
 Ability to communicate complex problems to a non-technical audience 
 Extensive breadth of industry experience across multiple technology domains 
 Demonstrate depth of knowledge in one or more areas of technical specialism 
 Ability to influence and motivate staff outside of direct reporting line 
 Expertise of TOGAF
