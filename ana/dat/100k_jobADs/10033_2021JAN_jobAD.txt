 Of Job Hunting and Socialisingâ€¦ 
 February 8, 2011 Fabulous Forty-ish Misfit 
 â€¦Yesterday I went for a job interview, the first one since I was diagnosed with depression. And, I am thrilled to report that it went extremely well! The position is right in my field of study - Importing and Exporting for a company that is situated closer to home than the farm was. The hours are much better and the pay is the same as what I was getting at the farmâ€¦so less hours for the same money in a position I'm well suited for - sounds perfect. 
 I played open cards with the employment agent regarding my illness, and she said that she will discuss it with the client, but she also understands the fact that the long hours at the farm, resulting in no home-work balance is what drove me a bit nuts. The client is currently in France and will be back on Sunday, so I am expecting to hear about an interview not-too-long after that. I asked how many interviews she had conducted for the position and she said two before me, but both were not suited to the position. She will continue to look for alternative options for the client to choose from, but she is definitely going to recommend me. 
 Today Anne and I got together for brunch at one of our local haunts - it was her treat. We had a great catch up - she is looking absolutely fabulous with all the visits to the gym and kick-boxing she's been doing. 
 From there I went to pick Elizabeth up from work and we went through to George - to do a bit of shopping and just mosey around the other shops in the mall. We are really exciting people - she bought two boxes of Granola cereal and I bought a sassy new set of underwear at Mr. Price. We then hit Truworths and bought our friend, Liza two pretty satin nighties as she and her boyfriend of a year are going to be spending the weekend together, seeing that Valentine's is on Monday. Unfortunately I couldn't join Elizabeth in delivering them, but I will no doubt hear about her reaction tomorrow some time. 
 Anyhow, I'm off to go and get myself all showered up and comfy in my PJ's. I have a date with CSI in a while. 
 'Til laterâ€¦

 Don't worry too much - it's just the first interview and the agent's attitude seems just right. 
I'm sure your friend is going to like the negligees, as will her boyfriend ðŸ˜‰

 I'm not worried Cin, I am feeling extremely positive. 
As for the negligees, I wouldn't mind having some myself, and a boyfriend to enjoy them with either ðŸ˜‰
