 Meet Jenina, employer service representative 
 
 Meet Jenina, employer service representative 
 Published on: January 06, 2020 
 A career with a difference 
 As an employer service representative on our assessments team, Jenina, plays a frontline role in helping us deliver service to employers in B.C. 
 Employer service reps help employers register for no-fault insurance, maintain their accounts, navigate their insurance coverage, and resolve issues related to coverage, registration, and financials. 
 "Our department makes a difference by supporting employers who are seeking coverage for their workers," Jenina says. "I feel that I make the biggest difference when I can solve problems by communicating policy and answering questions in an approachable and understandable way. Sometimes when I'm dealing with someone who has a lot of questions, they'll stop at the end to share a genuine and wholehearted thank you. It's in these moments that I know I have made a difference to that person, which is a great feeling." 
 What began as a temporary summer job during her student years has turned into a 15 year career with WorkSafeBC. "Over the years, I've grown and advanced both personally and professionally and have been fortunate enough to be part of an organization that invested in my growth through onsite professional development, which has helped me to thrive and get better at my job." 
 Being part of an organization that champions safe and healthy workplaces has also lead Jenina to be more mindful of her own health and safety. "WorkSafeBC is a fantastic employer. They treat you really well and are truly committed to providing a respectful, safe, healthy, and secure workplace. As an organization, they recognize that a healthy workplace helps ensure quality of life, productivity, and success for their employees. They show us that they really care."
