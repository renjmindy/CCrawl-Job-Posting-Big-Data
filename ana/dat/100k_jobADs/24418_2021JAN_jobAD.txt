 Saw a Tweet Today Wondering About Creating a Web Series… Or NOT?? Ask Mark Gantt About Being FEARLESS! 
 August 26, 2010 minglemediatvnetwork   Leave a comment 
 Okay, so I'm not going to get on a soapbox and preach but I think it's pretty amazing that web series creators are making their  " Passion Projects"  as my friends from the  WebTV Workshop  say… and that in itself says a lot about where the entertainment industry is going, everyone now has access, PLUS you have unlimited opportunity to reach everyone who has a smart phone or Internet access, so what are you waiting for? 
 Okay - so you hear people say "Be Fearless" and maybe you think it's a cliche' but when you look at the example of how web series creator/actor Mark Gantt took what was in HIS HEAD and made it into a webseries that now has international distribution by Sony…. you want to know more about how it was done, right?? How it can help you be FEARLESS! 
 Well… let's start with what happens when you don't let the word "NO" or the phrase "you can't do it" rule your world…and you follow your dreams… 
 It's been lots of fun to actually have seen Mark's passion project and of course purchase "The Bannen Way" … can't be a true fan if you don't support the cause!! We did talk to him on the Red Carpet before winning a Streamy Award for best actor (this should get you pumped - yes I know, this is backwards storytelling, but it's my story!): 
 Now that you see you be a  True Hollywood Story  and can achieve your dreams… don't you want to meet the man, the myth, the legend? Here's Mark sharing a tip after a recent Web TV Workshop Pro-Panel:  WebTV Workshop tip . 
 Wait a minute… you're not getting all pumped up and ready to be "Rocky" running up those steps in Philadelphia yet?? Well watch this clip and you'll be that and cocky….Here's the trailer for The Bannen Way: 
 Well, I hope I didn't scare you off… Mark started off with a dream and didn't settle. Now here's the awesome part… Mark is holding a ONE day, open the kimono and share all in Los Angeles this Saturday. This is your opportunity to sit down with other web series creators - dreamers - and talk straight to Mark Gantt about how YOU can do it too. Here's all the info about the workshop  http://createyourowncareer.eventbrite.com/ . 
 This special Saturday workshop covers finding YOUR voice to how the Bannen Way became the success it is -- and he didn't have a huge budget to start with. I can tell you we met Mark via Twitter and he has built a fan-base on Facebook and his pitch-site was amazing… but don't let me be the spoiler… you should check the workshop out today… and if you have questions… and you should have a Twitter account anyways, ask him your questions about the workshop… You can find him here  http://www.twitter.com/Mark_Gantt  (tell him Stephanie sent you… oh, if you're a casting director and want to have a successful project… cast Mark Gantt!) 
 This message was not paid for by Mark Gantt … but I did drink the Koolaid…. and soon you will drink it too! 
 More about Mark Gantt: Mark's latest project that he co-wrote, produced and starred in called The Bannen Way ( http://thebannenway.com ) has been an incredible success. Financed by Sony's Crackle distribution arm, this unique Web Series/Feature Film, has broken records with over 14 million views, won 4 Streamy Awards including Best Actor (Mark), Best Drama, Best Director and was nominated for 2 Webby Awards. Due to its vast success, Sony Pictures Television is currently developing the project into a TV series. 
 Be sure to check out the workshop information  here …
