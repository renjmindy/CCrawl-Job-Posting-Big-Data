 Permanent Workfare, Housing Benefit Cuts, Food Stamp Style Smart Cards And School Children To Face Jobcentre Harassment - The Latest Rantings From Iain Duncan Smith 
 Posted on  September 29, 2014  by  johnny void  |  85 Comments 
 School children will face Jobcentre harassment from the age of 15 whilst claimants thought to have drug and alcohol problems will be paid benefits on smart cards if the Tories win the next election said Iain Duncan Smith in his speech to the party's conference today. 
 18-21 year old who cannot find a job are to be placed on permanent workfare, whilst further caps on Housing Benefits will see yet more cities become unaffordable for anyone currently unable to work - whether this is through sickness, disability, high unemployment or having young children to care for. And if this wasn't enough then benefits are to be frozen for two years, meaning a real term cut in the incomes of the UK's poorest people,  whether they are in or out of work. 
 The smart cards will be for people Iain Duncan Smith thinks have fallen into a "damaging spiral" and are spending all their money on drugs, alcohol and gambling. Whilst details so far are scant, it seems likely to be similar to the Australian Basics Card which aims to control how benefit recipients spend their money. The scheme has already proved hugely expensive and has led to people unable to shop at cheaper stores such as Aldi, who government officials say do not meet the "set criteria". Predictably Basics Cards have  not prevented claimants buying drugs, alcohol or tobacco.  In the UK it is likely to stop people who have genuine problems with drugs or alcohol from seeking treatment in case the Jobcentre find out. It is a stupid idea, as unworkable as it is callous. You can see why it would appeal to a nasty fucking idiot like Iain Duncan Smith. 
 Permanent workfare for 18-21 year old is equally draconian, and equally unworkable - so unworkable that it was  actually first announced  in George Osborne's Autumn Statement last year and then never implemented. Already  there isn't enough workfare to go round , and with  resistance to workfare showing no signs of dying down , there will be few community organisatins willing to take part in such an explitative programme. Meanwhile sending Jobcentre busybodies to harass schoolchildren when they should be studying for their GCSE's and aren't likely to be looking for a job or eligible for benefits for two or three years seems little more than a waste of everybody's time. 
 With Iain Duncan Smith's welfare reforms unravelling in all directions and poverty not seen in generations returning to haunt the UK, there was nothing in his conference speech to suggest he has learnt anything from his failure. The scary thing is, he thinks he is doing a wonderful job - even still pretending that Universal Credit will eventually be rolled out across the country. Yet across the UK millions of people are facing a Winter where they will face the bleak choice between heating or eating and many will not be able to afford either. 
 It is horrifying that the Tories seem to think they can win an election by making poor people poorer. Perhaps more frightening is that the Labour Party have eagerly embraced this vile competion to attack and scapegoat those with nothing. Whoever wins the next election it will be down to us - unemployed claimants, disabled people, parents and low waged precarious workers - to fight these bastards. It will be the struggle that defines the neo-liberal age as capitalism run rampant drives people into the the ground in the name of making more profit for the rich. We must continue to fight, and we must win.

 …………interesting question to the people killers; 
 From: T.kay 
 29 September 2014 
 Dear Department for Work and Pensions, 
 You will be aware that certain things cannot be paid for using a 
pre-payment benefit card such as paying fares on public transport 
or buying gas and electricity to top up pre-payment meters. 
These have to be paid for using cash upfront. 
Please state what provisions the DWP will have in place to ensure 
that vulnerable people who will receive these pre-payment benefit 
cards are not inconvenienced were this is concerned. 
 Yours faithfully, 
 Mr Kay

 unfortunately for the brainwashed out there they will think this is a good idea.. the PR or the tories will go into over drive, (labour is just as bad).. I already suffer from depression and anxiety caused by the dwp.. Violence should be used as a last resort.. but unfortunately we are being pushed to that.. where is labour, no where to be seen.. perhaps they will connect the benefits card with calorific counts..just waiting for them to do it to stop "obesity",

 Don't be too sure - and even if Labour win it things will be just as bad, The present state of UK politics is such that the next election result is probably wide open.

 Iain Duncan Smith is the most vile and twisted man on earth, but fortunately his smart card scheme will probably be about as successful as his rollout ofUniversal Credit, it aint gonna work. It's obviously not about saving money as the cards will probably cost more than he's likely to save its about degrading and humiliating people.

 We're all smokeless now. Not even the relative security of the sooty chimney awaits tomorrow's children. 
 Orwell's vision is unfolding as we speak - the masses kept pointlessly busy and distracted by shiny things, the middle management beset by permanent insecurity into a perpetual cry of "Do it to Julia!" and the tiny minority who have real power ensuring that they are never, ever challenged again. 
 Why? Well, at some point very soon, peak oil, population growth, food shortages, financial instability and climate change are all going to coalesce, and Western society - possibly human survival at large - will collapse. The 1% (actually, more like the 0.01%, but they do like their hangers-on and yesmen) have evidently decided that they represent the most deserving of humanity, and must therefore preserve their own power, and thus chances of survival, at any cost. And they know, like all good psychopaths, exactly how to manipulate "the little people" into giving them whatever they want, whenever they want it. 
 We're excess baggage. The second it looks like it's them or us, they'll fire up the incinerators and lay on the special trains. When Bill Hicks said "the problem with Hitler was he didn't think big enough" - clearly someone heard him.

 We don't have to go as far back as the Victorians to see the "service" tradition. In the 1930s, my Dad's eldest sister was sent at the age of 13 into service to some rich industrialist family near Birmingham, to skivvy and slave away for them in return for a mattress in the attic and pennies per week (with reductions for food) One Sunday off per month. She was born with a deformed lower leg and at the age of 14 contracted Tuberculosis in the bone. She continued working, in increasing agony until the age of 19 when the leg was amputated. For the first time in her life, she was free of pain. Then, she was immediately sacked (the family sent another kitchen servant to deliver her dismissal letter to her in hospital) The letter told her that the family did not wish to have a "one legged cripple" in their home as it would upset their own children. 
 This kind of brutality hasn't ever really gone away.

 it they do permanent workfare then they will have to have holidays and minimum wage. they will also not have time to look for work and if they were harassed into it they would break their own law for how long a person should work a week. The taxpayer won't be pleased they have to pay a wage to someone when the company who is profiting from it does not have to pay.

 Did the years of political correctness particularly the emphasis on a uniform emotional surface - sociopolitical suppression make the UK citizenry averse to political agitation on the streets. 
 Historically the peoples of the British Isles have not stood patiently in political queues, what changed that?

 The loss of hope engendered by having everything we'd gained since the turn of the century reversed in a couple of decades might have something to do with it.

 Your obsessed by race and bigotry that is all you want to see in the alternative opinions to yours, you create the other in your own narrow authoritarian mind. 
 There is no reference to race or religion in the comment you dimwit, the question was why did the citizenry become averse to political agitation.

 Dear Department for Work and Pensions, 
My questions relate to the proposed food vouchers that will be 
made available instead of cash. 
 1/ Will the food voucher entitle the holder to a two course or 
three course meal? 
 2/ Should a tuxedo or formal evening attire be used? 
 3/ Will the soup or gruel be of a consistency to be placed in a 
begging bowl? 
 4/ Will the voucher entitle the bearer to a varied diet, ie; 
is the menu changed regularly? 
 5/ Could a poor family share one voucher and save the remaining 
vouchers as a treat for a weekend feast? 
 6/ Are knives and forks necessary or could the contents be decanted 
into one bowl? 
 7/ Have the food vouchers been trialled at Westminster in any of 
the taxpayer subsidised restaurants? 
 8/ Will the food vouchers be redeemable at participating 
restaurants in either the commons or lords? 
 9/ Have ATOS HCPs tested the food available from the vouchers to 
see if it is worthy of sustaining life? 
 10/ Are the vouchers edible, in the unforseen event food is not 
available? 
 11/ Would sanctions be used against any poor person who turns to 
cannibalism in the event the scheme fails? 
 12/ Does the DWP intend to keep a league table of satisfied 
customers or will they just die, as they do at present? 
 13/ Will the holder of any unredeemed food vouchers be able to 
convert them to cash after this policy of demonising the poor 
collapses? 
 Yours faithfully, GEOFFREY REYNOLDS

 Amazing, it has always been implied, but here we have it, actually being singled as low life no good scum before school even ends. An classist attack in its utmost purity. I'm sure the nice morally upstanding middle class kids will not stoop as low as bullying their scrounging "lessers".

 George Smith's rantings are no longer worthy of serious attention.A column or two in a poor jokes section maybe.

 IDS needs very seriously to be charged with misappropriating state funds and made to be accountable for his spending. He has wasted it due to incompetence and pursuing vicious policies rather than wanting to help alleviate poverty or even to save money. This scheme is yet another that will waste much more money than it saves, hence you can see that his meaning and purpose in life is not to save money, or help the low paid (as he has said) but rather to make them suffer indignities and further poverty when they are living in the world of politicians making. He is deeply flawed as an individual.

 If smart cards are handed out so peope can't buy alcohol, tobacco or gamble, does that mean we won't have to do any workfare for companies that offer those products as it could be thought of as a temptation we should avoid. 
They allow criminals to buy tobacco in prisons so I guess it's one law for criminals and another for the decent unemployed with no criminal convictons. We already are being told we may have to do twice as much community work as criminals are allowed to do. 
UKIP are the extreme right wing tories who might split the tory vote and hopefully they will destroy each other. Labour are going to be hard on the poor but it might be possible to reason with them rather than the right wingers who really want to see the poor suffer. When Osborne mentioned that he was freezing the benefits for the unemployed a small minority clapped. Making the poor even poorer isn't the right time to clap but it shows how nasty some of them are.

 Of course this wont stop people "buying" food and selling it for tobacco, or alcohol.. would just mean more crimes, theft of these payment cards. then you get with loan sharks taking the cards til you can pay off the loan you need because you have no money.. then of course they will bring you cant buy anything that's a luxury or fattening .. cant have people being fat, so government gruel, then force them to work for free in the very companies that refuse to hire them.. so making profits, no doubt the donators to the political parties will be the ones running the cards, and the supermarkets..

 Oh, it'll be worse than "no luxuries". Think rationing. You get your 50g of cheese, 50g of meat, etc etc per day; so if you buy a 400g block of cheese, you can't buy any more for 8 days. That's the endgame - total, finegrained control of people's lives. The very antithesis of what conservatism is supposed to be about, but the acme of authoritarianism.

 The Chancellor's hidden blow to disabled people. 
 The Chancellor’s Conference speech contained a statement about disabled people and benefits which was misleading, but went largely unchallenged by the mainstream media. Mr Osborne promised a two year freeze on working age benefits if the Conservatives are re-elected but made a point of saying, "disability benefits will be excluded". Is that true? 
 Well, it all depends on what you consider to be a disability benefit. Included in the proposed freeze are people who receive Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) and are part of the Work Related Activity Group (WRAG). These are people who the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) have decided are not fit for work at the moment, but are required to undertake work related activity, with a view to returning to work in future. 
 The public would probably assume that this group was for people who had had an accident or injury from which they would soon recover, or an illness which was expected to get better. No doubt that’s what most of the audience in the conference hall who applauded the Chancellor’s speech would think, if they thought about it at all.

 Not everybody on benefits is a drug addict/alcoholic, and not all addicts are on benefits. What an insulting stereotype. IDS really does want to take us all back to Victorian times doesn't he. 
 If this ridiculous policy is made law, all that will happen is that: (1) people who really do have problems with drink and drugs won't care as they'll find a way to get their hands on their fix anyway. That's why it's called an addiction. It's an illness and it's not as simple as saying "Just don't drink." They need to be offered help, not condemned. And to be perfectly frank, if I was an alcoholic or drug addict, something like this would only put me off seeking help in case it was used against me in future. (Although that's another point. Why would the DWP have to know anyway? I'm sure treatment programmes are funded by the NHS. Wouldn't it go against medical confidentiality for staff at these places to divulge information to DWP about claimants?) 
2) Non-addicted claimants will be punished and inconvenienced because we can't pay for vitals like our standing orders (how my rent is paid), direct debits (water bills), PAYG electricity meters (my stove is powered by electricity and I need that to cook with) and public transport to travel to job interviews. Especially public transport. Which is proof to me that I'm-a-Drunken-Sadist doesn't actually give a damn if we find work or not. If he really cared about that, he wouldn't try and take away the things that can help with that. He just wants to punish anyone who's not rich like him. The man is pure evil. 
 Why can't some people accept that there is no foolproof way of weeding out the minority of "piss-takers" without punishing the genuine claimants. The Tories have probably spent more on their so-called "reforms" than has ever been lost to benefit fraud. Whether we like it or not, that's just a small price for living in a compassionate society. But I've seen quite a few comments elsewhere on the Internet saying "About time too!" and when someone explains what I did above about other essentials we'd still need cash for, the response is "Well get a job then!" Makes you want to scream "I AM LOOKING FOR A JOB BUT NO FUCKER IS HIRING AT THE MOMENT!" Do they really think if "just getting a job" was that simple, this would even be an issue to be discussed? Ignorant people make me angry.
