 This is not your regular engineering leadership role..... Are you an experienced technical engineering professional who can manage a large team of design, development and applications engineers across two sites here in the UK and in Europe and be an active part of the global engineering function and the EMEA leadership team? 
 This global industrial and automotive engineering and manufacturing business has multiple sites across the world and a truly global client and manufacturing footprint. They manufacture and assemble some of the leading components and systems in their specialist field and supply some very varied and prestigious customers on a truly international basis. 
 This role is about ownership and deployment of the engineering teams within the EMEA region and it reports directly to the VP of Engineering within group. The Engineering Manager will lead a technically capable and experienced team to deliver both new product development for new clients as well as constant re-engineering projects for existing customers needs and requirements. 
 The Engineering manager will need a strong technical design / development and project engineering background and ideally a degree level education in an engineering related topic and the ability to analyse and improve process and always have a mindset of continuous improvement within the function. They will be a driver of best in class engineering process and be able to deliver against demanding customer requirements while supporting the business as a whole from an engineering perspective. You will be an active member of the local leadership team as well as be part of a matrix structure globally and report into the board at HQ. 
 The Engineering Manager will require a proven technical understanding around the principles of Thermal Management and Heat Exchange for this role as there will be an expectation of technical leadership for the team and within the organisation. You will need to be able to travel into Europe for around 1 week a month and further afield internationally when required on a less frequent basis. 
 This role has come around due to internal promotion and development and so this is very much an organisation where the motivated and driven who deliver results can grow and progress their careers on an international basis. 
 If you would like to understand more around this exciting opportunity and gain some more detail, then please contact Matt Harris in for a confidential discussion.
