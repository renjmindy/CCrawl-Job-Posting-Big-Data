If your employer has a workers compensation program, then you may be entitled to coverage for medical expenses, loss of wage, and more. 
 If you or someone you care about was in a workplace accident and sustained serious injury, please consider calling us at Polsky, Shouldice & Rosen, P.C. for advice right away. Here we have provided insight into workers compensation cases and why having a lawyer may be the best decision you will make. 
 About Workers Compensation Programs 
 Every state in the US requires businesses to carry workers compensation insurance. This program protects workers who suffer from injury or illness due to an accident or hazard in the workplace. However, it is not a fail proof system, as there are many instances where a worker’s claim is not handled properly. For example, a worker may be wrongfully denied coverage when the circumstances of the incident qualify them for receiving benefits. Or, an employer may intentionally mishandle the claim, such as filing it late or providing inaccurate details, as a way to save the company money. 
 Workers compensation programs were established to help reduce conflict between employer and employee in the event of a workplace accident or health hazard. This program was created with good intentions. But, as a Bronx On The Job Injury Attorney has seen before, an injured worker may be treated unfairly and not receive the benefits they are entitled to. 
 Requirements for Eligibility 
 The laws for workers compensation does vary by state, and there are specific requirements that must be true in order for a worker to get workers compensation benefits. If you believe you have been unfairly denied benefits or aren’t receiving enough to cover your basic losses and expenses, then we urge you to call us immediately so we can intervene and set things right. The requirements for eligibility include the following: 
 
 You were injured during performing a work-related duty. The incident may have happened on the job site itself, or while traveling for work. 
 You are categorized as an employee for the company. Employees include full-time workers, part-time workers, some seasonal employees, and temporary employees. Independent contractors, volunteers, farm laborers, domestic workers, or undocumented workers may not qualify. 
 You were not under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol when the incident happened, you didn’t cause the event to unfold, and you did not intentionally harm yourself to get benefits.
