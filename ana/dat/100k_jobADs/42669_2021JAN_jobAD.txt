 Cooperations with WMH 
 New impulses through knowledge transfer 
 For us “Part of your drive” also means to support the young talents of the future. This is why WMH Herion maintains a particularly close cooperation with the university Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt and university-affiliated research institutes. The transfer of knowledge goes both ways. The students of the university benefit from experienced WMH engineers who share their knowledge with the next generation as teachers. WMH Herion regularly gains new impulses with the commitment of the students, which is essential for the continuing further development. 
 Multi-functional 
 WMH products can be found anywhere where something moves. WMH Herion ensures the right drive in more than 50 sectors ranging from classical areas such as toolmaking, mechanical engineering and machine and plant engineering through automation technology, aeronautical and medical engineering to mechatronics and renewable energies.
