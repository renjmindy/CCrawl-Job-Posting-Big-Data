 About this project 
 it-programming / mobile-development 
 USD 1,000 - 3,000 
 My company needs to inform the status of their products once they have been ordered. 
The idea is to have an app where the driver of the truck where the products go, enters the status of the orders (if they are in transit, if they are delayed or on-time, etc.) I need to know the cost of the development, the maintenance cost, and the cost that users (drivers) should pay to use it. The information should be visible in real time and the number of drivers is 3000. I would like to see a cost structure to understand if the best model is to charge by user license or if I should use a different model.
