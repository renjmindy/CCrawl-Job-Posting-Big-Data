 An update on my morning job 
 Published on  Mar 23, 2020May 12, 2020  by  Liz 
 I have just heard from my employer for my morning job and they would like me to stand down for the time being. 
They understand how upsetting this may be for me, but they are thinking of my health. So it looks like I will be having a little lie in. 
I will get up in the morning at 7am, instead of 4.15am, while no longer in my morning job.

 Thank you Lily for your award, but I don't do these award type posts now. I will answer them though here, a little later tonight, or in the morning though. Which I don't usually do, but will make an exception. 
Thank you once again and I will answer soon.

 1. This can vary from walks outside in nature, to staying in at home and watching dvd's. 
I like to take the opportunity to pamper my feet at least once a week. This is essential due to me walking a lot. 
 2. Save as much as I can. 
 3. Me living on my own. I can do my own thing and only have me to answer to. 
 4. The community on WordPress.

 Thank you. I understand them doing it, but I am a little upset. It helps though still knowing I am working in my evening one still. But things may change, after emailing them, as I wanted to query a couple of things. One on a personal level and the other a general level, after latest announcement with Boris Johnson. I will know more tomorrow night, unless it happens earlier before shift.

 That's unfortunate. I hope it won't be the same at your other job.

 I received a response to say he was still fine me coming in. But, it may be our last night for all of us as there is talks closing the building to remaining staff and public. 
Will know by tomorrow night unless a decision is made sooner and we are all told not to come in.

 Hi Eliza. I just seen this comment and missed it somehow. 
Yes, it's going to be tough for us all in some way. 
I can handle alone time being an introvert. I have come out more, mixing and mingling. But like my alone time. So depending on how long it goes on for, could make me more of a quieter person at the end of it. It probably wouldn't last long though, given how I love both my work places, the evening where I work alongside other supportive colleagues. 
But it will be the not working bit, that will get me. X

 I know, you said somewhere about what work gives to you. I'm enjoying it, too. I hope you can be in touch with your workmates virtually… and that it doesn't last too long… 
Love, light, and glitter

 That's a shame Liz, but it's clear they're looking after you -- well done to them. Enjoy the time away and stay safe. Caz x

 Yes, they are looking after me. I understand. 
 I won't be in my evening job either now. But it's not just me. It's all of us. I have recent a Government text to say all our buildings are closed to staff and public.

 That's it - we're in complete lockdown. At least it will give me time to fix my blog - having so many technical issues and not able to like or comment on lots of blogs. Also having to sign in everytime I touch a button lol --it's driving me nuts!

 Any blogs you come across where you look like you have to log in, even though you are already logged in, try refreshing the page. I have come across this and I refreshed the page to find I could comment without logging in. 
 Yes depending where in the world you are whether lockdown, or very close to it we need to find things to make our day productive. Hopefully by keeping busy some way, it will help us get through this. X

 Thanks for your suggestions Liz - but something is seriously wrong with the technical side of my blog. I can answer comments here but I can't like or comment on others posts. I was trying to change my URL name and God only knows what I've done. 
I had to just switch it all off early afternoon cos I was getting in such a state trying to find help/support! 
Well, I've got all the time in the world to fix it now. You stay safe my lovely. Caz x

 Refreshing the page has not worked for you then? 
Will be best to contact the technical team if that's the case. It could be something that only they can sort. X

 I've been trying all night to sort it. I've made a few changes so fingers crossed. I'm exhausted but can't sleep cos of the anxiety - I might have lost everything 😦 I'll keep you posted and thanks again Liz x

 Thank you. 
 I am at home completely now, as my evening job, our building is closed to staff and public now. Had a text in the night, which I have just seen.

 Can you still go outside for walks? 
   2. **[Liz](https://mywellbeingandlearningjourney.wordpress.com)** says:
 
 Mar 24, 2020 at 3:04 pm 
 Guidelines are you can go out for a walk once a day, observing social distance and only other things that are essential like shopping for groceries, which they like you to limit the trips on that as much as posdible. But I don't plan to go any further than my garden, unless it's to shops. I want to make sure I have my social distance.

 We have been walking the dogs, observing social distancing, but so is everyone else. The sidewalks and trails were crowded yesterday.

 Glad that people are observing the social distancing. They are taking notice then of the powers police have, should they choose to ignore.

 I’m not sure how much the lock-down is enforced here. I don’t think social distancing is enforced by anyone except the people nearby shaming each other!

 Because I have asthma and so classed as vulnerable, I have received my NHS text to advise to stay in. But when you live on your own, that's not an option when it comes to getting my food. But I shouldn't need to go out for that until next week now. 
   7. **[KDKH](http://peacewithmylife.com)** says:

 My husband and I are both asthmatic and are relieved to be working from home. We venture out weekly for groceries, but our area was just put on a stay-at-home restriction. So groceries are the only thing we can leave for. 
   8. **[Liz](https://mywellbeingandlearningjourney.wordpress.com)** says:
 
 Mar 25, 2020 at 5:04 pm 
 I can only go out for groceries, health reasons. Work was on the list that said was only necessary. But as you know, I'm not working at either jobs. 
I am trying to keep my groceries to just once a week and I am only going to go as far as the garden outside, for fresh air. I will avoid my nature reserve for the fear if people are gathering there, with it happening at other places. 
Anyone though does get caught in groups of 2 or more will be dispersed and possibly fined for ignoring the rules.

 It will be wishful thinking, but I have a feeling this is going to go on a bit longer than 3 weeks. Time will tell. ❤️
