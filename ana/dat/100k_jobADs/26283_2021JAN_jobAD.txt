 Shameful: Scottish Charity Journal Publishes Terrorism Allegations Aimed At Boycott Workfare -> 
 The 2.25 Million Hidden Unemployed People Reveals The Stark Truth: There's No Fucking Jobs 
 Posted on  April 29, 2015  by  johnny void  |  78 Comments 
 
 A senior DWP manager has a motivational meltdown on twitter. 
 According to the latest statistics there are currently 1.84 million unemployed people. There are also 1.3 million people working part time because they cannot find a full time job. Nearly half a million people who are officially employed work less than six hours a week. Over 100,000 so-called employed people are actually on unpaid workfare. 
 But even this only tells half the truth about the number of under and unemployed people in the UK. There are a staggering 2.25 million people who are 'economically inactive' and want a job but who are not included in the unemployment figures. That means the true number of unemployed people, if unemployed is defined as not having a job and wanting one - which is how it should be fucking defined - is over four million. 
 The reason you never hear of the missing 2.25 million is because of an international definition of what unemployed means which has been agreed by statisticians to allow comparisons of employment rates between different countries. As such unemployed, as far as the official figures are concerned, means someone who is currently out of work, available to start work immediately and who has looked for a job in the last four weeks. Clearly this does not include everyone who is really unemployed. It doesn't even include half of them. 
 The 2.25 million hidden unemployed include those who have simply stopped looking for a job in despair (40,000 people) along with those looking after the family home but who would rather be in work, people forced into early retirement against their will and sick and disabled people who want jobs. 
 There are currently just 743,000 vacancies, many of them part time or temporary. If everybody who was unemployed found work tomorrow there would still be around 3.5 million people out of work who wanted a job. There are not enough jobs for everybody. Everybody knows this really, even Iain Duncan Smith's think tank who said last year that  "reducing unemployment to zero is neither feasible nor desirable". 
 Unemployment is not caused by unemployed people but a lack of jobs. So trying to 'fix' unemployed people with endless workfare, assessments and benefit sanctions will do nothing to fix unemployment. Yet every major political party pretends to think it will. The reason for this is that the public used to blame the government, or even capitalism, for unemployment. Politicians however would rather they blame disabled people or lone parents. Better that than governments having to admit to their own own ineptness - or even worse acknowledge that the magical free market will not create a job for everyone. 
 The latest attempts to cure people of unemployment would be almost laughable if the impact on people's lives were not so tragic. Jobcentres are now being run like cults, with managers spouting mumbo jumbo motivational garbage like Sandra Lambert's  now deleted twitter feed  calling on staff to 'pink up the pace' and  handing out sheriff stars to Jobcentres which meet benefit sanction targets . Half-arsed online Cognitive Behavor Therapies are on the way, to cure unemployed people's mental health problems. Pull yourself together and get a job is the message from the DWP for those who are unable to work due to depression or other mental health conditions. Forced treatment for some groups has been threatened should the Tories win the election. 
 That this flies in the face of what is considered good practice amongst psychologists no longer seems to matter. Unemployed people are now fair game for almost any kind of treatment as long as it's designed to punish and scapegoat. Claimants have at best been abandoned and at worst openly attacked even by charities and institutions which claim to support those with a mental health condition. 
 Towards the end of last year the president elect of the  British Psychological Society (BPS),   Jamie Hacker Hughes  promised the body would carry out an enquiry into the use of pseudo-psychology, benefit sanctions and workfare. Yet nothing has happened so far. As part of the  week of action against workfare and sanctions  contact them and demand they speak out against the current regime which has driven some claimants to suicide. Claimants do not have time to wait for them to get their act together, people are being pushed into desperate poverty and sometimes even their deaths now. To not speak up is to be complicit in the actions of this Government and hands a licence to whoever wins next week's election to carry on in the same way. 
 There are not enough jobs. Unemployment is not caused by unemployed people. The mistreatment of unemployed, sick and disabled people must stop. That is what anyone with a conscience must now be saying, as loudly as fucking possible.

Something I have trying to get over to people, there is no work out there for people. So, politicians should be looking at 'Prosperity without Growth', changing the system completely. Instead of promising this will jobs and that will brings jobs, when there are few jobs about.

 Work Programme at the Jobcentre is sitting around all day watching daytime tv training to be a tv critic. Being a work programme there are no working rights & tea breaks & will have to notify the jobcentre 2 weeks in advance if you want to use the toilet. Everybody is now off the unemployment figures.

 "EXTRACT FROM THE GOV.UK WEBSITE" 
 Support group 
 You don’t have to go to interviews, but you can ask to talk to a personal adviser. You’re usually in this group if your illness or disability severely limits what you can do. 
 Benefits sanctions 
 Your ESA can be reduced if you don’t go to interviews or do work-related activity as agreed with your adviser. This reduction can continue for up to 4 weeks after you restart the interviews or activity.

 I remember induction at ingeus 4 years ago ( thankfully that's all I suffered before I got work) . One of the conscriptees asked what if we don't get jobs in the two years we're here?? There are no jobs. Nothing changes except the s… Heaped on claimants. That increases!!

 Enjoyed this immensely. Been trying to convey this message to others for an age. I write on youth unemployment (particularly) and the upcoming increase on conditionality of social security for them infuriates me. If the Tories get in we're going to be seeing full-blown workfare. Keep up the good work, man.

 We'll see it from the Labour scum too, unless we let them know in no uncertain manner exactly what we want them to do about social security, conditionality etc. For a start, taking the regulations back to pre Jobseeker's Act 1995 and restoring the dole to it's 1979 value - which would just about double it, like Class War demands. 
 If enough of us are prepared to inundate local Labour MP surgeries with demands, then it will be impossible for them to ignore us.

 ELECTION 2015: Tories refuse to say which human rights they will dump 
 DNS – 24th April 2015 
 The Conservative party are refusing to say which vital protections they would scrap if they win the election and abolish the Human Rights Act (HRA). 
 The party’s manifesto says a Conservative government would replace the act – introduced by a Labour government in 1998 – with a British bill of rights, which it claims would “restore common sense to the application of human rights in the UK”. 
 But although the manifesto promises that such a bill of rights would “protect basic rights”, such as the right to a fair trial, and the right to life, which are “an essential part of a modern democratic society”, it does not say which other existing rights might be at risk. 
 And this week the party (led by prime minister David Cameron, pictured) has made it clear to Disability News Service that it will provide no information about what rights might be scrapped until after the election. 
 A party spokesman said: “You are going to have to find that out when we publish our draft UK bill of rights.” 
 But he confirmed that the bill of rights would not provide “an exact replica” of the rights included in the HRA. 
 Among the articles included in the Human Rights Act, many of which have been used to secure vital improvements to the lives of disabled people, are the rights to: freedom from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment; freedom from slavery and forced labour; respect for private and family life; the right to marry and start a family; the right to education; and the right to participate in free elections.

 They are already breaking every law ever written on Human Rights, Equality rights and Disability Discrimination. They are doing this in the hope they can get retrospective approval for what they have already breached when they try to introduce their Bill of British Rights. 
 Our condems bill of rights will offer no protection whatsoever, a sham document intended to increase poverty, workfare and take away any existing rights, especially disability and employment ones.

 "HUMAN RIGHTS, THE UK DOESN'T GIVE 2 FUCKS" 
 The UK is in breach of its own United Nations human rights commitment to provide people with adequate homes because the housing crisis is so serious, a consortium of leading housing charities has warned. They cite soaring housing rental costs, unhealthy conditions in homes, and rising levels of homelessness and warn of “profound issues of lack of supply, increasing housing costs, lack of security of tenure and homes of such poor quality that they are unfit for habitation”.

 I have applied for perhaps as many as 400 jobs since February 2015. I have been offered one proper interview in that time. Equally the other (very few) "jobs" I have been offered have been with agencies who have told me I have to pay for "checks" to work for them.

 My understanding it, that if you offer to get and pay for your own DBS check, the agency do not want to know………so you are correct, its either a mick take to make money, or a scam to get cash and not offer you any work

 The politicians dont care if we cannot find jobs, all they care about is that people cannot claim benefits. I was on the Work Programme and that was a waste of time, I have no doubt these Tories especially would murder people if they could. They are killing them indirectly with their benefit sanctions. Murdering scum.

 "THE RATS ARE DESERTING THE SINKING SHIP" 
 Voters from Iain Duncan Smith’s constituency last night called for him to be sanctioned – with his MP’s salary suspended – for failing to show up at his local hustings 
At the hustings, Campaigner Gill Thompson – whose brother David Clapson died after being sanctioned under a regime made more brutal by Duncan Smith – moved many in the audience to tears. 
 “My brother died because of Iain Duncan Smith’s policies,” she said. “He wasn’t a scrounger. He was a former soldier. He died with a pile of CVs next to his body. He was a diabetic. After he was sanctioned he couldn’t even keep his insulin cold in the fridge.” 
 Liverpool Echo reporter Joe Thomas – who is on board the Battle Bus – tweeted: “Last night’s rumour was correct and Esther McVey has pulled out of today’s live interview in Liverpool city centre.” 
 And the third senior minister in their department, Mark Harper, failed to show up at the last moment for a BBC debate on welfare. 
 “They must be terrified,” Gill Thompson said. “They can’t defend their record.”

 Initially we were hearing from claimants who said they had never received an ESA50. The big issue now, members tell us, is Maximus using ESA50s that are over two years old and refusing to allow new ones to be submitted.

 ……………therefore, the DWP, who issued the ESA Questionnaires initially, are providing out of date information to MAXIMUS, knowing full well, medical circumstances may have worsened.

 Geoff - this is not new - ATOS were doing this 2 years ago. 
I didn't complete the ESA50 as I was too ill to cope with it and too ill at that time to care. Two months later I was sent the appointment for the WCA. I got someone to drag me there and I knew what the first question would be: 'How did you get here?' My friend told the ATOS 'nurse' that he had driven me there. 
Second question - 'How does your depression affect you?' My first emotion was surprise but it turned to anger as I knew from reading this site that she was trying to get me to admit I was mentally ill. I am not mentally ill but physically ill and I had never stated I was depressed on any forms to the DWP. She kept trying throughout the 1 hour 20 minute interview to get me to say I was depressed. I kept repeating 'I am not depressed. I do not have depression.' 
She asked me nothing about my physical illnesses. She did not mention my missing ESA50, or make any reference to the one I had completed in the past, or any info. it contained. 
Other trick question she tried on me: 'What were your hobbies before you became ill.' I knew that if I told her, she would make out I was doing these hobbies now. Conclusion would be I was so active I could not be ill.

 And why is no one reporting Goddard has an unsavoury reputation among lawyers in New Zealand as a political puppet. She ranked dead last in the 2014 Judge Survey Results by New Zealand lawyers largely because she is perceived to be a judge who kowtows to powerful interests, particularly Crown interests

 OVER 60s NOT LISTED IN UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES 
 There are about 1 million 60-64 age group in the UK, not in work, not getting state pension and only on some kind of benefit. 
 Beyond these are the 'economically inactive' ignored once over 60. 
 The retirement age has risen since 2013 to 66 for women, as it has done for men, and rising for men even more. 
 THE FLAT RATE STATE PENSION WILL PAY 
NIL STATE PENSION FOR MEN AND WOMEN 
OLDER THAN THESE 
RETIRING FROM NEXT YEAR 
2016. 
See why, at end of my petition, in my WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT section, at:

 It's no surprise that the BPS have done nothing, they represent a large herd of psychologists who will make a lot of money out of delivering crappy and harmful CBT to claimants in any way they can. 
 Pretty much all of what "psychologists" offer is crude, third rate, behavioural garbage, so expecting them to address "Pseudo-Psychology" is quite a big ask since so many of their members peddle it to profitable financial effect. 
 Most governing bodies for professionals and organisations like the BPS are little more than trade bodies in disguise. They won't do anything that might disturb the income stream of their members. 
 That applies to doctors, vets, dentists, nurses and the whole range of HCRPs too.

yep exactly…but then many skilfully target those who do offer genuine help, as if, they are a money making scam… 
ie the work of dr bob johnson…everyone needs an income, and as he is a renown healer/psychiatrist, why should he not make an income from his work and he doesn't actually charge for his work, he puts any extra income back into his and his wife's QUAKER mission, too heal as many csa/ca victims as is possible….he is, i reckon 75 and still going strong, he has NOT jetted off to foreign lands… 
his work, radical and outspoken anti-establishment views, have destroyed his career, but it won't stop him nor his wife…imv, he would like nothing better than to be made redundant….. 
dr's regularly charge the nhs, and thus US, for their services…his services actually work/do the job…

 "dr’s regularly charge the nhs, and thus US, for their services…his services actually work/do the job…" 
 OBD, that's the cruel irony. What works is disdained, what doesn't, promoted. The harm caused by behaviourist therapies is never acknowledged. Funny how it's only the money making that is cherished. The plot has been long lost. 
 As ever, the very last thing the orthodox and established crapmongers want, is for us to be well. They want us to stay sick so we keep going back to fill their greedy coffers. 
 Anyone taking advice from the BPS, BACP, RCP et al, needs their head examined 😉 
 No one but the very few like Bob want us well.

 lucy 
yes steady income stream…duck for cover merchants, dancer arounders… 
imv it got much worse since that enterprise allowance scheme, some while ago now, these insane schemes exploded (all fueled by thatcherism /neoliberalism)…making money is god, gush up/gold rush effect….drip drip drip, trickle down effect….where one had to come up with business plans and be approved of, to get allowance and income…. 
all these quack fakes schemes emerged, a whole raft of them gained traction and acceptance even though they don't work, and obvs make things even worse, coz they deepen embed the underlying root causes of people with mh symptoms..so as their victims disappear into pharm drug haze and cognitive fog…ie ' why don't you want to be happy, what stops you?'….ie blame CSA/CA victim with/for having crap mind…. 
and these people then say we tried to help, but their problems were very bad and/or they wouldn't listen to our help, and blame the victims for their own failures…the now disempowered voiceless victim, cannot say otherwise….most of them based on one religious dogma or another…

 In a similar way that dentists destroy your teeth, doctors destroy your health. Those whose teeth last longer visit the dentist least, similarly those who remain healthiest visit the doctor least. There are so-called "ancient" cultures who live much longer healthier lives than us so called modern cultures without visiting the doctor once in their lives. And no doubt dentists too, who have to be one of the most money-grabbing fuckers around. if you think back to when you were a kid and they way they poked that awl into your teeth in a search of 'prophylactic fillings' there was nothing wrong with the tooth but "it would only decay anyone'… and dentists just love drilling for gold. Now they are inflicting root canal treatment and all sorts on primary school kids.

 Reblogged this on  Beastrabban's Weblog  and commented: 
Johnny Void here argues that apart from those officially counted as unemployed according to the agreed international definition, there are two and a quarter million hidden unemployed consisting of those who have stopped looking for work out of despair, those looking after the home, but would like to be working, people unwillingly forced into early retirement, and the sick and disabled, who would rather work. 
 He also exposes the way the governments have moved from recognising the failings of themselves or capitalism to produce jobs, to blaming the unemployed themselves. He is particularly scathing about the cult-like mindset with the Jobcentres and DWP, which promote any number of quack bogus psychology, like the tweet from Jean Sharpe above. The British Psychological Association have promised to tackle this, and have so far not done so. Mr Void provides a link to the Association's Twitter account and Facebook page for those wishing to contact them about this, and the information about this pseudo-psychological claptrap over at Boycott Workfare's website.

 I know someone who was unemployed for two years in Sheffield. During that time they applied for 20 or more jobs each week, week in week out (20×104=2080) and in all that time they only got one interview (they only escaped unemployment when a relative gave them a job).
