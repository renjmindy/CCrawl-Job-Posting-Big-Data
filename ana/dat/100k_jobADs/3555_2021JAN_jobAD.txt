 Greg Osby - Mob Job 
 Digital Crate Digging Continues on a Throwback Thursday; it's been a cool rainy day in Atlanta.. 
 A perfect mood for the Sunday Jazz type of vibe!! earlier? not off the rails like  Trump on Fox and Friends  I was rocking it with my friends!! chilling out with the tribe, those that understand a brotha! 
 Perfect food of the Sunday meal type will work for ya!!! the vibe is soon uplifted… 
 Perfect fools play too much!! shady deals are soon exposed after priorities shifted.. 
 Sanctions lifted per  Russia  or  North Korea?  it's all game, this  Greg Osby  track mentions a Mob Job.. 
 Check out the players and the track / scenario!! caught out there  like Bill Cosby?  the devil will steal / destroy / rob..
