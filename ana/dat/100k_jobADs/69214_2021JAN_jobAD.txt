  Is It Ever 'Too Late' To Get Your Dream Job?  
 Ryan Niessen 
 October 06, 2014 
 “  Am I too old  to get my dream job and do what I love?" she asked earnestly.  Related:   3 Smart Ways To Escape Your Life-Sucking Job  I've done the same thing for the past 17 years, and I feel like it's time for a change… But I don't know where to start? Is it too late for me to pursue my passion? This is one of many emails I get on a weekly basis asking different variations of the same question… 
 
 Is it too late for me? 
 (Hint: there's a great resource at the bottom that will help you with direction & clarity) Some people are five or 10 years into their career, while others are close to retirement and just don't feel ready to stop working yet. This can be a really difficult time, and it's a real pain point for a lot of people. I'll be honest with you... I'm 26 years old. So, I can't tell you from experience that it's not too late for you. What I can give you is what I've learned from people much wiser than me… And what I believe to be... 
 The Truth About Your Dream Job 
 In my own moments of crisis, I've spoken with people who are 10, 20, 30… even 40 years older than me… And I'm constantly surprised by their take on life. I've been told over and over again by my elders: “Don't worry. I'm still figuring out what I want to do with my life… so you're just fine." Combine this response with one thing I know for sure about life… Which is that things NEVER stay the same. People, relationships, careers… life in general is ALWAYS evolving. Forever growing. So the truth is this: There is no one final dream job. It doesn't exist. 
 So What Do You Do? 
 You go with the flow. Trust in the process. Evolve. Grow. Know that what appeals to you right now will not last forever. And as you grow, your dream job will change. I've lived a quarter-century, and I'm already on my 2nd “dream job." And I fully expect that to evolve and change as I grow. It true: Knowing what to do is easier said than done… so here are three questions to help guide your way: 
 3 Questions To Help Guide Your Way 
 
 If you were on your deathbed right now, what would you regret NOT doing? 
 If you could be known for one thing, what would it be? 
 How can you tie your strengths, values, and passions into something that makes an impact in the world and an income for you? 
 
 Answer these questions honestly, and trust in the process and evolution of life. It's NOT too late for you, and it never will be. However, it may be time for you to get your next dream job. I wish you the best of luck on your journey, and if you want a little help with figuring out and getting your next dream job, then check out the free video I put together alongside my mentor here. It contains three practical job seeking strategies you can apply today, as well a resource for finding some of the best companies to work for today - who are making a profit as well as a difference in the world.
