  Just Started New Job & Already Hate It  
 Work It Daily 
 July 27, 2009 
 Dear Experts, I started a new job two weeks ago and I already have a bad feeling about it. I don't like my boss and I don't like the people I work with. I can't leave because I had a hard enough time landing this job as it is. What advice do you have for coping with this sort of situation?  Here is how our T.A.P. experts answered this question:   Q#221  Put ur best foot forward & treat it as a learning experience. Continue your search! ( @DebraWheatman )  Q#221  Same thing happened to me a few years ago and it's tough. I coped by re-doubling my job-search efforts after hours. ( @gradversity )  Q#221  Attitude plays big part. Be positive, learn what you can while there. May get better. Start search again. ( @dawnbugni )  Q#221  Agree w/ @Keppie_Careers . It hasn't been long enough to really judge. Explore the co. for positives. ( @heatherhuhman )  Q#221  Find what U DO like about job. Seek projects/work to propel career forward if possible. Give it time. ( @Keppie_Careers )  Q#221  Be honest w/boss. Tell 'em it's not a fit. Maybe you can work together on something. Why'd U even start? ( @beneubanks )  Q#221  Trust your gut & keep looking; meanwhile, look 4 what u can lrn, do your best work, focus on positive ( @juliaerickson )  Q#221  2 weeks isn't really long enough to judge; try to keep an open mind and give it a few months; you might be surprised ( @AskAManager )  Q#221  Put the job search you started before you got the position back in motion & try to gain new skills while you're there.
