 Hi from FICCDAT -> 
 NIDRR Research Spotlight: Using a iPod Touch as a Job Coach 
 Posted on  June 2, 2011  by  naricspotlight 
 We just posted a new article in our NIDRR Research Spotlight highlighting the early results of a project at Virginia Commonwealth University. Participants in the project were people with autism spectrum disorders who were starting job trials, or periods of employment in a new job or new setting where the client receives support and training from a counselor or occupational therapist. Each was given an iPod Touch and trained in its use. The results are impressive! See for yourself at  http://www.naric.com/public/HighLights/v1n2.cfm
