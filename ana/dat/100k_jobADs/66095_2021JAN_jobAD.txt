  5 Things EVERY Job Seeker Should Know About Themselves  
 Work It Daily 
 April 26, 2009 
 By J.T. O'Donnell Tonight, I jumped on the CAREEREALISM channel over at Justin.tv with two of our interns (thanks Kat & Shannon!) to share with job seekers the  5 things everyone must learn about themselves  in order to find the right opportunity. If you can't explain your strengths in the following areas AND provide examples to support them, I can guarantee your job search will A) take longer, and B) be less productive. In short, you need to be able to articulate your: 1) definition of career success. 2) workplace personality. 3) learning preferences. 4) work style. 5) unique gifts. To hear why these 5 areas are so important and how you can assess them on your own, watch the following video clips. SEGMENT #1 - Why you need to assess yourself in 5 key areas.  Watch live video from CAREEREALISM channel on Justin.tv  SEGMENT #2 - How your workplace personality affects your job success.  Watch live video from CAREEREALISM channel on Justin.tv  SEGMENT #3 - How to determine which job is right for you.  Watch live video from CAREEREALISM channel on Justin.tv  SEGMENT #4 - Why you need to reach to people at the companies you want to work for or who work in a field you are considering.
