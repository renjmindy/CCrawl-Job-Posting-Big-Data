 Job 28 
 1 Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it. 
 2 Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone. 
 3 He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death. 
 4 The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men. 
 5 As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire. 
 6 The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold. 
 7 There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen: 
 8 The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it. 
 9 He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots. 
 10 He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing. 
 11 He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light. 
 12 But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding? 
 13 Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living. 
 14 The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me. 
 15 It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof. 
 16 It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire. 
 17 The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold. 
 18 No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies. 
 19 The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold. 
 20 Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding? 
 21 Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air. 
 22 Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears. 
 23 God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof. 
 24 For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven; 
 25 To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure. 
 26 When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder: 
 27 Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out. 
 28 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.

 Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.(Job 27:15 KJV) 
 Death is guaranteed to us all. The way we live our lives will display to others what we stand for. When we stand for righteousness our families will be influenced. In death we can leave our legacy for others to follow Jesus as we did with joy and not sorrow.

 Verse 28 AMP “But to man He said, ‘Behold, the reverential and worshipful fear of the Lord—that is wisdom; And to depart from evil is understanding.’” Same verse CEV "God told us, “Wisdom means that you respect me, the Lord, and turn from sin.” Simple right?? Yet, so many are aimlessly missing the mark. The Lord has blessed each and everyone one of us with a choice and an opportunity to follow Him. 
 Proverbs 16:2-6 AMP say "All the ways of a man are clean and innocent in his own eyes [and he may see nothing wrong with his actions], But the Lord weighs and examines the motives and intents [of the heart and knows the truth]. [a]Commit your works to the Lord [submit and trust them to Him], And your plans will succeed [if you respond to His will and guidance]. 
The Lord has made everything for its own purpose, Even the wicked [according to their role] for the day of evil. Everyone who is proud and arrogant in heart is disgusting and exceedingly offensive to the Lord; 
Be assured he will not go unpunished. By mercy and lovingkindness and truth [not superficial ritual] wickedness is cleansed from the heart, And by the fear of the Lord one avoids evil."

 28. And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding. 
 Searching for wisdom and understanding? Here's where to start - fear the Lord and depart from evil. When we do what we can, God will do what we can't. 
 Psalm 111:10 
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever.

13 Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living. 
 If we are ever going to live for God and fulfill His plan we all know that we must die to self. Yet, Wisdom and understanding goes beyound the place of our self sacrifice. As we see in this chapter God is the only one that "understandeth the way there of". So how can we exspect to find wisdom and understanding without Him? For "…the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding." 
 So, receiving the Holy Ghost and being baptized in Him name grants us access into heaven now we must keep our Gold card by gaining continual wisdom and understanding. We must daily commit to living a overcoming life by fearing the Lord and staying away from evil.

20) But do people know where to find wisdom? Where can they find understanding? 
21) It is hidden from the eyes of all humanity. Even the sharped-eyed birds in the sky cannot discover it. 
 
 And this is what he says to all humanity. The fear of the Lord is true wisdom; and forsake evil is real understanding.

 ““God alone knows the way to Wisdom, he knows the exact place to find it. He knows where everything is on earth, he sees everything under heaven. After he commanded the winds to blow and measured out the waters, Arranged for the rain and set off explosions of thunder and lightning, He focused on Wisdom, made sure it was all set and tested and ready. Then he addressed the human race: ‘Here it is! Fear-of-the-Lord—that’s Wisdom, and Insight means shunning evil.’””

 Is it that simple? 
 28 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding. 
 First, understand that this “fear” of the Lord can be defined as “awareness that God is watching and everything we think, say, and do” As Jesus stated several times: “I know your works.” Nothing escapes His attention. When we fear the Lord we understand who He is and sincere commitment to obey Him. I believe the link between the fear of God and wisdom is we cannot possess wisdom if we change God into our own image or someone more human. It seems too many people want to “tame” God into a non-threatening nobody. 
 However, if we redefine the Lord as a god that makes us feel comfortable, or a “buddy” who exists simply to bless us and give us what we want, we will not fear Him in the way He deserves to be feared or respected. The Lord God Almighty is far greater than that, and the fear of the Lord begins when we see Him in His majesty and power. 
 Until our hearts are in the correct relationship with God, we are unable to have true wisdom. Without the fear of the Lord, we may gain knowledge and make practical choices for our life, but we are missing the one ingredient that defines a wise person. Without the fear of the Lord, we make decisions based on our faulty human understanding. When we incorporate the fear of the Lord into every moment of our lives, we make decisions based upon His approval. We live with the knowledge that the God is intimately involved in our every move. He sees, knows, and evaluates all our choices, and we will answer to Him for everything we think, say and do.

Wisdom is such a blessing. … knowledge can be learned but wisdom has to be gained through experience. However there is a way to get wisdom. God says pray for wisdom and He will give it away liberally. Gold cannot be compared to wisdom so get all of it you can!

 Having the fear of the Lord and that will follow will be amazing but it will also be hard to learn how live with no shame that you will go places and talk all about God and his love, but also that you need to be saved and to never be ashamed of saying yes I follow God and I don't care if I get judge for following Jesus.

 Wisdom can be a hard thing to be find, and even if we find as much wisdom as we possibly can through our lifetime, it is only a small fraction of the knowledge and wisdom that God has. No wisdom from man will ever compare to the wisdom and knowledge of God. When we think that we have learned, we must remember how little we really know.

 And he said to man, The fear of the Lord that is Wisdon, and to shun evil is understanding. 
Job 28:28 
 Growing up, I remember the fear that I had towards my father when he was not around,and obeying his commands exactly the way he told us to do. At an early age, I figured that if I was doing what my father told me to do, I would avoid punishment by being obedient. The same principle applies in the spirit realm if we love the Lord we will keep his Commandments.

 Job 28: 12 But where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding? 
 We search for wisdom and understanding. We look for it in the earth it is not in the deepest parts of the sea, it is not in the ground like oil or plants. 
 Job 28: 18 No mention shall be made of coral, of of pearls, for the price of wisdom is above rubies. 
 We can't buy wisdom, or understanding, not silver or gold or even rubies can buy such a thing. 
 Job 28:28 And unto man he said, behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and depart from evil is understanding. 
 Seek God for that is wisdom, and avoid evil, that is understanding, and our wisdom and understanding should grow from there.

 A few times in the chapter Job asks where wisdom can be found. It's found not where, but when we fear The Lord and choose to separate ourselves from evil. Both are a decision we must make; how much do we value and desire wisdom?

 Job 28:12-13 (NLT) 
12 “But do people know where to find wisdom? 
Where can they find understanding? 
13 No one knows where to find it, 
for it is not found among the living. 
 Whatever it is we desire in life is what we will look for. The Bible says if you seek you shall find. This scripture applies to more than just prayer. Jesus said wherever your treasure is there will your heart be also. The reason why men have uncovered and mastered how to find gold and silver for wealth is because they have set their faces towards this end. 
 James 1:5 (KJV Strong's) 
5 -- If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. 
 There is no excuse for lacking wisdom. God has made it as easy as asking and seeking him for it.

 The Price of Rubies is Abive Wisdom. 
 Immediately my mind went to Proverbs 31 
Who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies. 
Wisdom and Virtue must go hand in hand. Wisdom is not obtained over night by most of us. It must be sought after and the word declares not until we have the fear of the Lord, not being afraid but a reverence attitude before God can we even begin to obtain wisdom. Virtue, Integrity,a longing to be more like Him. Folly is easily followed after but it takes great effort to have wisdom. Which way will I choose the easy road or the one that will lead me right into the face of God. I choose to depart from evil and run after God. Wisdom the price is far above rubies.

It cannot be purchased with jewels mounted in fine gold. “God alone understands the way to wisdom; he knows where it can be found,

 "The Way to get Wisdom, is to Get it Through Fear" 
 “And this is what he says to all humanity: ‘The fear of the Lord is true wisdom; to forsake evil is real understanding."

Wow, read this chapter in the NLT and it was amazing. It's like taking science class all over again without the liberal tree hugging textbooks. Then from the natural we are lead to the supernatural with the all out search for wisdom. This supernatural search for wisdom travels to the land where folks fear God. What does it mean to fear God… 
““I, Wisdom, live together with good judgment. I know where to discover knowledge and discernment. All who fear the LORD will hate evil. Therefore, I hate pride and arrogance, corruption and perverse speech.”

 JESUS IS MY GOD 
 28 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding. 
 Life is versed with decisions. In our early walk with JESUS almost daily we are making decisions that will ulrtimately affect our eternal future. Eventually we find ourselves at the place of making the decision to serve (fear) the LORD with all of our heart and that decision alone eliminates many other decisions. 
 To live life in the fear of the LORD, that is wisdom. It is responsible, to consider that I will not make a decision that will affect my future without seeking the LORD JESUS for HIS instructions, counsel or will. The understanding of wisdom is the choice to depart from evil. When we choose to seek and please the LORD we depart from evil attitudes, actions and activities. This is wisdom, knowing the present pain that evil decisions inflict on the LORD and the future pain that evil decisions inflict on us. We live by the fear of the LORD. 
 I choose JESUS IS MY GOD.

To know that the "fear" isn't to be scared or frightful of what God can do to us, but understand that his omniscience is watching over us. As Bro. Linton stated above, we must be aware that God is watching. There isn't anything that we can hide from Him. Would you allow others to see you as God sees you? What can we change in us that would make our God proud?

 You want wisdom? You want to know it all? You do if your born again, because he lives in you! And he (GOD), is with you, and in you, so you have all the widsom/God you need. But, all you have to do is ask him for it and he gives it liberally. But, fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom but, not the end of it! So, keep asking him for it! You might wake up one day and be a modern day Solomon!

 Everything does as The Lord commands, but God gave man a choice. We have a choice to follow His commands or not. We have a choice as to fear and reverence Jesus or not. We have a choice as to doing right or wrong… The fear of The Lord (reverence of Him and His name, His commands, His statutes) is WISDOM… Departing from evil, ( the new testament says to hate the very appearance of evil, but to forsake our carnal desires) is UNDERSTANDING… 
 Only with wisdom and understanding will we be used as efficiently as He wants to use us to reach the souls around us… Let's GO be wise, understanding His will.

So, we need to put our trust in Christ and we will gain wisdom, and knowledge. He is the almighty, and I will trust him!

 Job28. 1-2 today's (the new English amplified Bible). Surely there is a mine for silver, and a place for gold where they refine it verse 2 Iron is taken out of the earth, and copper is smelted from the stone ore. No silver or gold is worth having just trust in God for everything .

 And he said to the human race, “The fear of the Lord—that is wisdom, and to shun evil is understanding.” 
Job 28:28 NIV 
 As far as I can remember I always wanted to please my father and do what he said because I knew that if I disobeyed him He would pour out his wrath on my behind and that hurt!! Which is why we should all obey God's commandments because God's wrath is much more painful and can be eternal.

 Amp. 28:27-28 
27. Then He saw wisdom and declared it; He established it and searched it out. 
28. "But no man He said, 'Behold, the the reverential and worshipful fear of the Lord-that is wisdom; And to depart from evil is understanding.'" 
 As I pondered over this chapter; It caught me that there are still some things that I need to do. My walk with God is growing, but there are still things that I need to consider: are they for His glory or my fleshly wants. I know that I'm still a babe in Christ. Am I growing fast enough to gain the wisdom and understanding of God or do my desires still affect how I'm seeing God. Somebody once asked me what is the difference between religion and Christianity. I answered him by saying, "Religion is mans view of God and Christianity is Gods view of man." Now that I look back at that statement; it fits. I now am beginning to understand that I need to see myself as God sees me; not as I see God. Thank you Jesus for the clarification. God knows me; my struggles and what I need to do to fix them. 
 Haggai 1:5-7 
Now therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts, "Consider your ways! "You have sown much, but harvest little; you eat, but there is not enough to be satisfied; you drink, but there is not enough to become drunk; you put on clothing, but no one is warm enough; and he who earns, earns wages to put into a purse with holes." Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Consider your ways! 
 Psalm 28:7 The Lord is my strength and my shield; in him my heart trusts, and I am helped; my heart exults, and with my song I give thanks to him.

 We could say that it is foolish to not depart from evil. The end thereof will only cause you harm. Why would anyone wany to harm themselves? But it is being done so constantly by not fearing the Lord.

 Wisdom is a blessing to 
those who gain understanding. It is more valuable than silver 
and more expensive than gold. 
Wisdom is more precious than rubies and in fact nothing we can desire can compare with her. Wisdom is the application of understanding and knowledge. It's the light of life filled revelation to a ignorant mind. Life may teach us lessons that yield wisdom but their is none other than the revelation the Lord brings. We are not to lean onto our own understanding and world wisdom but on him. When we trust God to bring us wisdom he takes us deeper than we ever thought possible.

 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.(Job 28:28 KJV) 
 Job was explaining to his friends how God is the giver of wisdom. When we fear him and respect him, we begin to understand who he is. Gaining that revelation is like a lamp being lit in a dark room. Seeing his marvelous light will cause is to turn away from the darkness our minds and sinful thinking.

 Job 28 24-28 For he looked to the ends of the earth, and see the under the whole heaven; To make the weight for the winds; and he weight the waters by measure. When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the thunder: Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out. And unto man he said, behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding. 
 Job teaches us that ture wisdom comes from understanding that God's purposes are beyond our understanding but that we can live life trusting in His goodness. Job also teaches us that there is a purpose in suffering, even though we might never know what that purpose might be. God is the Creator, we are His creatures. His knowledge and wisdom are beyond our understanding. We need to trust Him in everything, everything no matter what comes our way because he is the way maker.

 To have wisdom is to have something very valuable. It's essential that we listen to our elders. In there wisdom, we can find strength and how to not make the same mistakes.

 12 But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding? 
 13 Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living. 
 14 The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me. 
 So often we find ourselves seeking after something. People will take a sabbatical in hopes to find themselves but are rarely satisfied. Some may be happy living in ignorance but many want more in life. Wisdom is something that can be attainable but also out of reach. We can search the deepest depths, highest highs, swim across the seas and never find it. It's in Christ that our search can be fulfilled. He is our provider and can provide wisdom if we seek it. Seek the creator not the creation.

 ““God alone knows the way to Wisdom, he knows the exact place to find it. He knows where everything is on earth, he sees everything under heaven. After he commanded the winds to blow and measured out the waters, Arranged for the rain and set off explosions of thunder and lightning, He focused on Wisdom, made sure it was all set and tested and ready. Then he addressed the human race: ‘Here it is! Fear-of-the-Lord—that’s Wisdom, and Insight means shunning evil.’”” 
 Get Wisdom 
““Get [skillful and godly] wisdom! Acquire understanding [actively seek spiritual discernment, mature comprehension, and logical interpretation]! Do not forget nor turn away from the words of my mouth. “Do not turn away from her (Wisdom) and she will guard and protect you; Love her, and she will watch over you. “The beginning of wisdom is: Get [skillful and godly] wisdom [it is preeminent]! And with all your acquiring, get understanding [actively seek spiritual discernment, mature comprehension, and logical interpretation].”

 It's most pleasing to the Lord that we turn away from sin. Wisdom is fearing the Lord and following his commands. God all powerful give us the knowledge we need to do your will and not ours.

 This whole chapter talks about how hard it is to find wisdom and understanding but the last verse makes it so simple 
 28 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding. 
 If you are trying to find wisdom without God you will be on an endless journey but if you turn to God he makes it easy to find. 
 “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the Lord, and depart from evil.” 
‭‭Proverbs‬ ‭3:5-7

 ““But do people know where to find wisdom? Where can they find understanding? No one knows where to find it, for it is not found among the living. ‘It is not here,’ says the ocean. ‘Nor is it here,’ says the sea. It cannot be bought with gold. It cannot be purchased with silver. It’s worth more than all the gold of Ophir, greater than precious onyx or lapis lazuli.” 
‭‭Job‬ ‭28:12-16 nlt 
 I desire to filled with wisdom. Every time I hear sis bower pray for me I hear. "Lord give him wisdom beyond his years". And I continue to pray for wisdom. Amen.

 Job 28:The search for Wisdom 
 V.28:28 And unto man he said, Behold , the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding. 
This concept of the fear of the Lord unites all the wisdom books. 
Proverbs 1:7 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge : but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 
The fear of the Lord means submission to the Lord and His revelation. 
 Ecclesiastes 12:13 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments : for this is the whole duty of man.

 “But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding? 
 Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding? 
 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.” 
‭‭Job‬ ‭28:12, 20, 28‬ ‭KJV‬‬ 
 Wisdom and understanding can be illusive to some people. People often make mistake after mistake to learn through the lessons of life. The key to wisdom and understanding is the voice of God. If as a people we will down our will and pray then God will give us wisdom and understanding. When we pray with the purpose of communing with God it tells Him that we have a fear or reverence for him. It also tells him that we want to be more like him and less like the world. This simple action of prayer leads to wisdom and understanding. The once illusive key components will be within reach.
