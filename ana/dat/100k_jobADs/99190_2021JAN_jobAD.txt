 When I started my quest to work from home, I worked in the public school system as an elementary guidance counselor. I worked with many teachers who enjoyed their jobs, but were frustrated by the hours that went well beyond the school day and kept them away from their own children. This was made worse for many who had to have second jobs to make ends meet. 
 Fortunately, today there are work-at-home opportunities for teachers to work full-time or part-time using their teaching skills.

 Requirements for Work At Home Teachers 
 Like other jobs, online teaching requires you have specialized skills and experience. In many cases, for elementary and upper grade teaching, you'll likely need a teaching license or certificate in the state the job is being offered. Teaching at the college level requires a minimum of a Master's degree. There are few that don't require certification, but usually requires at least a BA/BS and sometimes experience. 
 Other things you need include: 
 
 Reliable high-speed Internet: To teach from home, you'll be working primarily online, usually through video (i.e. Skype) 
 Computer that can handle the memory and operational needs of video conferencing 
 Top quality virus protection and security. You'll be working with children and families that need to have their personal information kept safe. 
 Dedicated phone: Some of these jobs are done by phone, and it can help to have a separate phone for business. 
 
 What Types of Jobs Are there For Teachers and Educators? 
 As you'll see below, there are many types of work teachers and educators can do from home. Along with teaching and tutoring, there are jobs in curriculum development, test scoring, writing and more. 
 These jobs vary in the hours offered and required. Some have a minimum of hours you need to work a week, and others are completely flexible. Some are full-time employment with benefits, although most are contract jobs that can be done full- or part-time. Some are freelance, in that you can decide what you offer and when you offer it, such as selling your curriculum s or as-needed tutoring. 
 What Do Work At Home Teachers Get Paid? 
 Pay for teachers who work from home varies greatly, mostly depending on the type of work you get. Some places, such as virtual schools, pay traditional teacher salaries, while others pay a per-hour rate. In general, teachers who are teaching or tutoring will be paid anywhere from $10 to $20 or $25 per hour. This can go up if you're teaching advanced courses such as nursing at the graduate level. 
 Other work, particularly work that is flexible, you'll be paid per project. Or some offer marketplaces to sell your curriculums or knowledge, in which case you can often set your price. 
 How to Get Hired to Work At Home as A Teacher? 
 In many ways, the process of teaching at home isn't much different that other teaching jobs. You'll need to apply, and provide any required proof of your teaching education, certification, and experience. 
 You will likely have an interview that will be done by phone or video conference. You'll be asked questions about your teaching or educational experience and teaching style. You may get subject specific questions as well. Many of the typical job questions can be asked such as what are your strengths and weaknesses. You may be asked teaching specific questions such as what would you do if you had a student who is having difficulty. Finally, you may be asked about your home office (quiet place to work) and your comfort level in using online technology to teach.
