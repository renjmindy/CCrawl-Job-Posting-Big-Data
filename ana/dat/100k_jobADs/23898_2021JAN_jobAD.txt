 How I built my career - writer, typesetter and editor Amie McCracken @amiemccracken 
 Posted by  Roz Morris @Roz_Morris  in  The writing business  on December 13, 2020 
 How do you get a career working with words? We all have our own routes. In a new occasional series, I’m interviewing people who’ve turned their wordy bookwormy passions into their profession. Today: Amie McCracken 
 Roz  How did you get here? 
 Amie  In a roundabout way to be honest. Though I have always been obsessed with story and books and reading, I went to college thinking I would become a journalist. I double-majored in creative writing and photojournalism. When college ended, I tried my best to find a job in magazines or a publishing house. Nothing panned out; instead I worked as a veterinary technician for my dad as well as a smattering of other odd jobs until my husband and I moved to Germany. 
 It was then that I started getting into the freelance editing world. It really is my passion, but it took me a while to figure that out and to find my groove. 
 Roz  What was the first step and how did it lead to paid work? 
 Amie   I have worked my butt off, a lot of it for free . 
 There really is no clear-cut way to freelancing. It takes a lot of networking (how I met you, Roz!) and putting yourself out there. I worked for a few small presses to begin with, had a few mishaps in working for the wrong people—a vanity press at one point, eek!—but gradually I have built my reputation and now writers come to me. 
 Roz  Same here. I did a lot of things I wasn’t a good fit for, but while doing them I met the right people. It takes years, taking whatever comes along, and also jumping on opportunities. 
 Sometimes you have to be really cheeky.  I became an editor with Cornerstones literary consultancy because I found one of their flyers, advertising their services. I wrote to them and said ‘I want to work for you!’ Fortunately, the cheeky pitch is much less embarrassing on the internet than it is in real life… 
 Amie  I have done everything from editing calendars and textbooks to mentoring authors through the writing process to proofreading magazines. Last year I finally had to create a schedule because I was booking projects a few months in advance. And now I’m full up four months out. 
 I think I knew I finally made it when I felt comfortable saying no to projects that didn’t interest me. That is a place of power as a small business for sure. 
 Roz  Tell me about the creative writing element of your degree. What foundations did it give you that you still use today? What did you learn about yourself as a writer? 
 Amie  As an author, I still call myself a hobbyist. It has nothing to do with the fact that I don’t have the self-confidence to say I’m a writer or author. It’s purely because  editing is my career, but writing is my creative outlet . I do not want to turn that side of my life into a business. Though I am very happy to help other authors do so! 
 Roz  Was your degree useful for your editing work? 
 Amie  The act of writing, and having studied it in college, has of course taught me a lot of skills as an editor. I think the simple act of immersing oneself in story, via writing, editing or critiquing others’ work, and reading, is one of the best methods of improving your own storytelling. In the same way that language is best learned by immersion, taking in the language through as many forms as possible,  writing skills improve the more time you spend with stories . 
 There are skills I have built upon that continually add to who I am as a writer and editor. I believe that the voice of a story develops as you write it (and then is improved upon rewriting), and the same goes for your voice as a writer. It is like a fine whiskey, improving with age and as you learn to savour. 
 Roz  You’ve published in a variety of niches. Sometimes you’re in science fiction territory with  Devolution  and  Emotionless . Sometimes you’re overlapping with contemporary real life (  Blink  and your latest release,  Leaning Into the Abyss  ). 
 Amie  My novels  Blink  and  Leaning Into the Abyss  cross into the magical realism genre, and I would say that is actually my bent. Both  Emotionless  and  Devolution  dig deeper into the sci-fi worlds, but are very light sci-fi as I don’t explain complex technology or math like other true science fiction does. So for the most part I am a magical realism author. 
 Roz  Tell me more about your affinity with magical realism. What magical realism novels first made you feel at home there? 
 Amie  Alice Hoffman is my idol. If I could write as many varied characters and as prolifically as she does, I would be proud. Her writing is something to dive into and get lost in. Every sentence is crafted beautifully, and the magic is utterly subtle but permeates every moment. 
 Robin McKinley writes farther on the fantasy side, but the gentle build of her plots and the beauty of the magic involved always entrances me. 
 The same goes for Erin Morgenstern. Her stories are much more fantastical than I will ever write, but the depth and emotional pull of her characters always has me in pieces. 
 Roz  What makes an Amie book? Do you have any recurring themes, character types you’re most interested in? 
 Amie  My books tend to ask a major question.  Emotionless  questions what would happen if we could remove hormones from our bodies (I am type 1 diabetic and insulin is a hormone, so I wondered what would happen if I could remove the problem instead of fixing it). 
 Roz  Ah,  much SF comes from  our own personal experience of science! 
 Amie  My novel  Devolution  asks what would happen if humans stopped evolving and we had to rely on genetically modified babies to kick-start evolution again.  Leaning Into the Abyss  asks what life would look like with a major shift via a catastrophic event (the death of a groom just before his wedding). So my writing is heavy on theme and is brought to life by the characters. 
 
 Roz  You also have a non-fiction book,  Giving Birth To Motherhood . 
 Amie  Yes,  Giving Birth to Motherhood  exists because I am a mother and went through a traumatic birth. It helps other mothers write their birth story while looking at it from a psychological perspective for the motivations behind actions and reactions. It is intended to teach mothers to heal themselves and find catharsis through intentional journaling. 
 Roz  And you have a bootcamp for writers… Six-Month Novel. 
 
 Amie  I started  Six-Month Novel  with a business partner (Charlie at Urban Writers’ Retreat) because we both felt there was a hole in the offerings. Charlie runs writing retreats, both for a day and residential, and I work directly with authors, but we wanted something longer term that allowed writers (and us!) to focus on completing an entire novel. We didn’t want it to be the same as normal writing courses; we had heard of too many people completing MFAs and then getting stuck. So we don’t teach how to write,  we simply help you find the habits  that work for you and then keep you accountable so that you can complete that novel you’ve been wanting to write for ages. It’s a programme that is intended for seasoned writers who feel stagnated or afraid to jump into their next project. 
 Roz  How do you find time for your own creative writing? Do you have a routine or timetable? 
 Amie  I’m a very self-motivated person. I was homeschooled, which for me bred ambition and taught me to get shit done. So when I have a project ready and waiting, I jump on it every moment I have. I do tend to work better with larger chunks of time, and my husband is amazing at giving me entire weekend days or even writing retreats that last a week or so. 
 Roz  That’s a great idea. And a great husband… 
 Amie  I make sure and schedule things like that into my calendar. I’ve gotten very good at time-blocking since my son came along—when he is at kindergarten during the day, I focus on work; when he is home, I focus on him; and when he’s asleep, I focus on writing. I don’t really know how I’ve managed to get so much done. I’ve only published books since having my son five years ago. I often wonder what I did with all that free time before I had him! And really wish I hadn’t wasted it… Though I was building my business and travelled a ton and learned a new language and wrote a few first drafts and ok, I guess I wasn’t that lazy. 
 Roz  I recognise what you’ve identified here. If I’ve spent days or weeks thinking or researching, I feel like I didn’t get anything done. But that time is necessary. Especially in the early stages of a book. It’s discovering the territory. 
 Amie  One of the best things I’ve done for my writing in recent years was to  learn a second language  (German) and try to write in that language. It has opened up a whole other set of books to me, but has also pushed me to realize what language does on a fundamental, sentence-by-sentence level. I’m much more picky with my words now that I understand the impact language has on meaning and intention. 
 Roz  Do give examples! I have a smattering of school French and German. While learning them, I was intrigued by the things they have words for that we don’t. Both languages have separate words for the two connotations of ‘know’. They feel that distinction is important, whereas we don’t. And genders - if you’re of a poetic bent, linguistic gender must add another dimension to your work. 
 Amie  Most definitely! One oft quoted source is German fairy tales. In German, a girl is called  das M   ädchen . Das is the neutral gender, so technically a girl is  it  and in the case of ownership, you would use the equivalent of  his  with that noun. For example with Cinderella, “  Es war einmal ein hübsches Mädchen, das war sehr traurig, den seine Mutter war vor Kurzem gestorben.  ” Literally: “Once upon a time there was a girl, it was very sad, because his mother was recently deceased.” This example, and other  gendered nouns for humans, has led to some frustration in recent days when equality comes into the conversation . But it has me wanting to see if I can play with my English and really pinpoint the intention behind a sentence using the vocabulary while also keeping the implication instead of stating things baldly—showing not telling. 
 Roz  Speaking of endless quests of learning, the arts are something we never truly master. There’s always more to work on. Even if we’re also teachers. Where do you do your learning? 
 Amie  Books! I read widely, including non-fiction books about writing, but I love dissecting classics as well as contemporary novels. 
 Roz  Me too. I learn far more from novels than from craft books. 
 Amie  I read for pleasure, but also to understand story on every level possible. 
 Roz  Sometimes people ask me if reading analytically spoils the pleasure. I find it doesn’t. It's  part of the pleasure, the appreciation . I can analyse at the same time as enjoying. That means I’m a very slow reader. I can be trapped by a paragraph, perhaps because of its imagery or because of the way it delivers an emotion that’s been carefully set up earlier. 
 Amie I inhale the written word. 
 Roz  I love the intimacy of it. Print into eye, into brain, into heart. A remarkable process.
