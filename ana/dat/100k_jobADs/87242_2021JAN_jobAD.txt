  Don’t Use “Unemployed” To Describe Yourself. Here’s Why...  
 J.T. O'Donnell 
 November 26, 2019 
   
 I want to take a minute to talk about the word "unemployed." If you're one of the more than 15 million Americans who is unemployed at the moment, I want you to listen up because I want you to stop using that word in your vocabulary from this day forward. 
 
 It is a negative word. It is a defeatist word. It sounds definitive and it drags you down and it impacts your job search. 
 Trust me, I know this to be true. 
 What I want you to do is to replace it with the term, "between positions" or "between jobs" because that's really what you are. I recently recorded a new video tutorial on the  10 New Career Rules for 2020  and I can tell you one of them is that, "EVERY job is temporary." In this day and age, people can have as many as nine careers in their lifetime with an average of three jobs in each one. Having gaps in employment is the new normal! 
 We Don't Stay In One Career Our Entire Lives (Never Mind One Job Or Company!)

 It is natural, normal, and common for people nowadays to have parts in their lives where they will be between jobs. It's just a fact! This means we shouldn't feel bad about it. It is what it is. And that's why I'd like to banish the word "unemployed" from your vocabulary. Let's never say that word again. If someone asks you what's up with your career, simply say you are between jobs. 
 But saying you're "between jobs" won't make your employment problems disappear. 
 A Lot Of People Between Jobs Are Not Approaching The Job Search The Right Way

 Did you know the average job search in America is nine months? And that's in a good economy. Why does it take so long? Because most job seekers don't understand the new rules to career success and how they impact their job search. 
 If you want your time between jobs to be as short as possible, you need to educate yourself on the best way to ensure your skills are in demand. If you want to learn how to do that, check out my  newest tutorial  on the 10 new career rules. 
 No More Saying That Ugly “U” Word

 We won't even mention it from this point forward. You are between jobs and busy learning what you need to do to speed up your job search. You can do this. Don't let your circumstances impact your mindset. 
 P.S.  If you are between jobs, be sure to check out my YouTube video on the  3 words never to use in your profile headline  as it relates to this same topic!
