 Coach Profile 
 | 
Vikram Kapoor, Esq., PCC 
 How will clients benefit with you as their coach? 
 I help young professionals do good and live well in a noisy world, by getting to clearer goals, dealing with people differently, and leveraging their unique strengths. Oftentimes we begin by getting clearer about your passions and purpose, your values, and what makes you special. I also empower leaders to be coaches and thereby help their staff and their organizations to thrive. 
 What results have clients reported after working with you? 
 My clients regularly feel better about career goals, find new opportunities to really stretch themselves, and come to find a certain amount of alignment on what they want and what they need. I help people plan out personal mission statements, develop a "leadership brand," re-engineer their decision-making style or approach to conflict, and any number of other things that pertain to the career of a young professional (primarily Millennials and Gen-Z). 
 What do clients say about working with you? 
 My clients love that I bring in cutting edge research and learning to the conversation. They also often appreciate how I help shift perspective and challenge them to just approach issues from a different frame of mind, including through role play. 
 What is your coaching philosophy? 
 I believe that every client is creative, resourceful, and whole. There's nothing to fix because nothing's broken. I like to spend time on what is working well and how we can leverage that in new areas of life. I will spend some time on "the Achilles Heel - the weakest weakness" but my coaching focuses mainly on strengths, well-being, hope, optimism, resilience and, etc. I am also a facilitative coach - I like to help my clients come up with their own answers, rather than giving them my answers. I do this because I don't believe my answers are always the best answers for my clients, and I want to teach people how to fish. 
 What strengths do you have as a coach? 
 I love to learn. I am skilled at developing people. Gallup Strengthsfinder says I'm also strategic, an arranger, and I'm good at relating with people. All of these strengths allow me to be of most service to my coaching clients. 
 What types of clients do you work with? 
 I like to work with millennials and younger professionals who want to either become subject matter experts in their chosen vocation or to grow into new leadership roles. That said my clientele includes a full range, from entry-level to senior executive. 
 What is your professional background? 
 I am President of Extra-M Coaching and Consulting, with a client list on five continents and every major industry. I am a lawyer and ombuds by background, and my specialty is resolving conflict, facilitating agreements, settling disputes, and promoting better communication among groups. I have been coaching for many years now and am a member of the Forbes Coaches Council. 
 My other ventures include stints in non-profits that range from educational to humanitarian and I manage coaching programs for the United Nations where I am teaching UN employees how to be coaches in 30 countries. I am also a professor of dispute resolution and have been active as a leader in the American Bar Association, where I helped to promote awareness about executive coaching.
