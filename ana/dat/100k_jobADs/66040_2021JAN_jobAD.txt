 Hi! I love your site. Iâ€™m hoping to do dicta/transcribing. I used to do it at work, and I loved it. Just FYI, the Door Dash hyperlink goes to some free lotto page and fake winnerâ€™s certificate. I hope you werenâ€™t hacked. You have the best videos and information I have ever found. I desperately need all my teeth fixed and Iâ€™m hoping to be able to earn enough to get it done. I canâ€™t thank you enough for your excellent advice. 
 Cheers from Canada ðŸ™‚
