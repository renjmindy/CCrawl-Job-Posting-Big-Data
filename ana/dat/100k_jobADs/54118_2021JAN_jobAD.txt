  Job Board Detox Tip #1: Create a Job Search Plan  
 Lisa Adams 
 August 06, 2012 
 Welcome to the first day of your detox - your  job board detox  that is. Throughout the month I’ll be sending you tips to help you through “life without job boards”. The whole goal is to help you be more effective in your approach to  job search  and to leave the “crutch” of job boards behind. I want you to end this month with an appreciation for the other ways to search and a healthier use of job boards. Use them in the most effective way and not as a time waster.  Today’s tip:  Create a plan for your search for the next 30 days. Yes, a plan. If you fail to plan, you plan to fail. There are several steps involved in a quality, effective, job search. Some of my colleagues will list as many as 40 steps and depending on the type of position, it could be that many. For this tip, break it into five key areas. 
 
 Defining Target 
 Marketing Yourself 
 Connecting with Decision Makers 
 Research and Prepare 
 Go Get It - Interview and Accept a Position 
 
 Write out a plan for at least the next 30 days of what you want to accomplish in your search.   Job board detox image  from Bigstock
