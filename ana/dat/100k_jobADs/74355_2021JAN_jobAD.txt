  How To Get Hired With A Criminal Record  
 Work It Daily 
 January 25, 2021 
   
 It's difficult enough to get hired nowadays without having a criminal record. So, is it even possible to land a good job after committing a crime? 
 The short answer: yes.  But it's not going to be easy, unless you follow these three steps during your next job interview.  
 1. Come Up With Your Explanation 
 Employers will conduct background checks on you. The old rule of thumb was that a felony comes off your record after seven years, and it does. But the internet has a much longer memory than that. Your criminal record will probably always be up there for employers to find. If you have any record with the police, HR can (and will) find it. So, it's important that you tell employers about your criminal record before they find it out for themselves and then hold it against you in the hiring process. A key thing to remember as you look for a job with a criminal record is that It's not about overcoming your criminal background; it's about working through it.  Before you mention your criminal record to a hiring manager, come up with your explanation. Use the "Experience + Learn = Grow" model, which is the same strategy you should use when  answering behavioral interview questions . Tell the employer the facts. Take all of the emotion out of it. Don't make excuses. Simply tell them what the situation was and what happened. Then, tell the employer what you learned. What did this powerful experience teach you? (Don't focus on the negative.) And how did you grow from this experience? 
 2. Take Responsibility For Your Actions 
 Let's be honest: we don't like to admit that we did something wrong, that we failed or made a mistake. When we own our mistakes and failures, we have to admit that we're not perfect. And no matter how many years we've been on this earth, that's still something a lot of us struggle with. If you own something, you can change the outcome. And that's what you need to do when looking for a job with a criminal record. Take responsibilities for your past actions and mistakes. If you don't own it, then you're helpless. Whatever you do, don't have a victim mentality. Don't think someone or something has control over you. By owning it, you can make things better. The hard truth is that trying to defend yourself, trying to push some of the blame on something else, really hurts your credibility. If you don't say, "I own it. There were other factors involved, but I own it," during your  job interview , no one is going to trust you. We understand that it's really hard to own the mistakes you've made if you haven't yet come to grips with them. Just know that you will have to in order to get a job, and that it will be so incredibly freeing.  
 3. Show The Employer How You've Changed 
 After you've explained the "grow" part of the "Experience + Learn = Grow" strategy, you'll want to have examples for  how  you've grown as a person and as a professional. It is very hard to gain people's trust when you're looking for a job with a criminal record. It's very hard to get a job at all. Tell the employer this, and then show them what you've done to earn people's trust again. Try framing the conversation like this: "This is what I've done to try to build my reputation, gain trust, and  develop my skills  since then. Here's where I am, and here's what I'm doing going forward. Here's what I'm doing to put this behind me so it's not an issue anymore." Employers need to hear this. They need to know you've gone through that thought-process and have grown and changed as a person since committing the crime. If they can walk away from the job interview knowing that you own your mistakes, learned from them, and have bettered yourself since committing the crime, they won't hold your criminal record against you as much as they would have if they had found it before you brought it up. 
 So, take responsibility for your criminal record. Make sure you're the one to bring it up first during the hiring process. As long as you prove you've learned from your mistakes and have developed the skills necessary to succeed on the job, you'll be viewed as a good job candidate. Good luck!

  The Most Important Part Of Your Resume  
 Jessica Holbrook Hernandez 
 Jenna Arcand 
 January 21, 2021 
   
 What's the most important part of your resume? We hate to say it, but the attention span of hiring managers seems to be getting shorter. 
 In fact, I was speaking with an executive-level individual the other day (who regularly reviews resumes) and he commented about how quickly he can scan through a stack of resumes and choose the candidates he plans to call. He admitted that it really is an unfair process—that so many job seekers are judged solely by the quality and presentation of their resumes (documents that too often are afforded a review of only a few seconds). And if it's a poor presentation, or boring to the reader, or just doesn't communicate the right message, they are quickly passed over. It's a given that the average employer will invest only a few seconds—literally—in his or her initial resume scan. So, it's critically important to your candidacy to ensure that the part of your resume in which he or she is willing to invest five seconds of attention grabs—and keeps—their attention. So, where is the employer's attention going first? And how can you make the most of that section of your resume?  
 The First Third Of Your Resume Is The Most Important 
 The top third of your resume is where the employer will direct the bulk of his or her initial resume scan. So, what you put here is vitally important. If it's boring, too text-dense, or doesn't speak to the position they're trying to fill, you're sure to be passed over. 
 What Should You Put In This Critical Section? 
 The top third of your resume should contain the most dynamic, persuasive, and noteworthy information about yourself and your career. Top load your resume with skills, accomplishments, and quantifiable results that are the most applicable to the position you're applying for. Here are some critical areas:   The contact information – Include links to your  LinkedIn profile , career blog, or professional website. Direct the hiring manager to places where he or she can find more engaging information about you. The headline – This is not a job title. It's where you summarize the problem you solve for employers, keeping in mind your  personal branding statement .  The experience summary – List 6-8 skills that are needed for a certain position. These are not soft skills. They are hard/ transferable skills  that will help you succeed in the job you're applying for. Remember: the employer has a need they're trying to fill, and if what you are known for meets that need, you've just become very employable. After you've caught the eye of the employer with your top third, they will be inclined to spend more time on your resume and read further. Your work history section should not contain any  resume fluff . It also should not be a summary full of generic statements that are vague and speak nothing to who you are or what you bring to the table as an employee. This is the time to set yourself apart as a candidate. Use specific keywords and  quantifiable information  in your bullet points under each job title. This will impress the hiring manager and make you stand out in a sea of job applicants.  
 Employers want to see results, and they want to know what you've accomplished in the past. Having a friend or family member look over your resume and then provide an opinion is nice when it comes to proofreading and pointing out errors within the resume. But someone who knows you and has a vested interest won't be able to really tell you in an unbiased way if your resume is boring. Try to have an unbiased third party give you some feedback on how engaging they consider your resume. Need more help with your resume? We're here for you!

  What's The #1 Thing That Holds Professionals Back & How Can They Fix It?  
 Jenna Arcand 
 Amy Hinderer 
 Dr. Jan Urbahn 
 January 20, 2021 
   
 As a professional, you might not know just how much potential you have in your career. There are many factors that can impact your career success, but one of the most significant ones is underestimating our own skills and abilities. 
 What's holding us back from achieving success in our careers? And how can we fix it?  Here's some advice from executives who've learned what it takes to succeed at a high level. 
 ​Amy Hinderer, Business Management & Operations Executive 
 One's belief system is the key to whether professionals will succeed or lag behind their peers. But wait, what is a belief? A belief is a feeling of certainty or conviction about what something means. One's belief system has been unconsciously formed based on their interactions and associations experienced, whether it was in childhood, education, relationships, or at work. These experiences are etched into one's mind and often a challenge to change because it anchored the feeling of a pleasure or a pain it caused.   So I ask, are your beliefs holding you back? Odds are the answer is yes. Let's dive in and show some common examples of limiting beliefs that may resonate with you and how you can change them.   Belief: I do not have the skills or talent required.  – Life requires humans to continue learning and progress. Taking risks and getting outside one's comfort zone is scary and uncomfortable. Take a moment now and map out the areas you want to improve. Establish and commit to your goals, measure the results, and modify as needed. Remember this, you will never know what you are truly capable of unless you try.    Belief: I can do this on my own.  – How many of you know someone who is so certain they are the only ones that can perform the work required? Leaders often hold onto too much. It's hard for them to let it go. This is an opportune time for the person to challenge their belief system. They can choose to view the delegation as a way of providing another individual with a developmental opportunity and perhaps even become a mentor in the process.   Belief: Successful people are simply just lucky.  – Successful people do share some common traits, but it certainly is not luck. It is about being persistent, committed, resilient, and passionate. Think about Stephen King, Vera Wang, J.K. Rowling, or Colonel Sanders. These individuals could have quit when things got bad, yet they continued and persevered to become legends in their fields. We have the power to shift our beliefs to ones that empower us to be our best.   Belief: I have to wait for the right time.  – We can always give ourselves the excuse, "It's not the right time," to jump into whatever it is that we want to do. Do not let the fear of failure keep you on the sidelines. If you never start, you will never succeed.   As Tony Robbins has said,  " The only thing that keeps you from getting what you want is the story you keep telling yourself." Amy Hinderer  is a business management & operations executive with 18+ years of experience in global enterprise and start-up businesses. She has managed teams ranging in size from 10 up through ~35K supporting revenues between $2M - $9B. 
 ​Dr. Jan Urbahn, Automotive & Shared Mobility Executive 
 My observation is that the leading cause for professionals not moving forward with their career is the discontinuation of learning. Two major trends have been developing over the past 20-30 years: We have moved to a society dominated by information, and innovation cycles keep accelerating. It is estimated that the entire amount of innovation of the 20th century was packed into the first 20 years of the 21st century, and the next innovation cycle might be even faster. In order to move forward in an accelerating environment, continued learning is highly important. These following strategies might help you learn new things.   Take an Online Course There are plenty of online courses available covering any possible professional topic. I've made good experience with Udemy.com and Coursera.com, and there are plenty of other platforms available with many free courses. In addition, many universities are offering some of their courses for free online. Furthermore, websites like Brilliant.com offer great daily challenges to keep the mind moving.   Culture Scan   Do a regular culture scan, at least once every three months. For example, I like to go to a bookstore which has a wide variety of print magazines. Take 15 minutes to scan the shelves. Reading the headlines on the covers will give you a good overview of current trends and developments in your field of work and in the broader economy. If you can't find a physical bookstore nearby, websites from Barnes & Noble and Amazon.com have a selection of current magazines to browse through.   Read Something Unfamiliar   Consider reading something about a topic that is completely outside of your area of expertise. You may purchase a magazine you have never read before or consider going to your local library and getting a book about something new. Reading about unfamiliar topics will cause your brain to create new synapses, which eventually will bring you to new insights and ideas. For example, I remember buying a magazine about knitting, which is not an activity I have ever engaged in. The magazine was full of fascinating patterns to knit, encoded in a specific language. The coding format triggered new ideas I could later implement in a project. Dr. Jan Urbahn  is an automotive executive with 20+ years of experience in product development, safety engineering, and operations in automotive and shared mobility business. He helped launch 3 new businesses with up to 1,500 shared cars in fleet size. His most recent leadership position is within the shared mobility space, where he helped develop a new EV battery and guided the coronavirus response. 
 We hope this advice helps you realize your potential. Stop holding yourself back in your career! You're more capable than you think you are.  Ready to take your executive presence to the next level?  Check out Work It Daily's  Executive Presence Program  today!

  3 Steps To A Dollar-Driven Resume That Grabs An Employer's Attention  
 Laura Smith-Proulx 
 Jenna Arcand 
 January 19, 2021 
   
 Readying your resume for a job search? You might find the traditional data—career titles, projects, and education—aren't enough anymore. 
 Now more than ever, companies have intensified their focus on one area of your performance: money. Employers want employees who can make, save, and control money, which will give them the strength to fight through any economic uncertainty. If you're an executive or professional in the midst of a job hunt, you'll find that writing a dollar-driven resume will help gain more interest from employers. This change will not only paint a more vivid picture of your qualifications, but help you land more interviews—and boost the level of the jobs for which you'll be considered. Netting more attention from companies eager to benefit from your expertise isn't as hard as it might seem. After all, most leaders can point to the effect of their work on revenue, profit, and cost. The trick is in sharpening your resume so it clearly demonstrates your effect on bottom-line metrics. Here are three clear ways to mine your career accomplishments for dollar signs and add the results to your resume: 
 1. Include Revenue And Profit Figures 
 Nothing will gain attention faster in a tight economy than telling an employer how much money you'll make for them. Many companies justify employee pay precisely on  the ROI they expect you to deliver . Depending upon your industry or profession, revenue figures can be challenging to produce. Sales leaders, for example, can easily list the amount of revenue generated from their efforts. Other professionals, however, may need to look at the revenue they've created in a different way. For example, if you've spearheaded a corporate expansion, consider adding the amount of strategic profit the company expects to reap from this effort (even at a later date) by referring to it as a projected figure. Perhaps you've been pulled into a steering committee or asked to analyze a crucial business process. If you can determine the amount of revenue the company can generate with these efforts, be sure to add it to your resume. If you've produced revenue in any capacity where the amount has varied over time, then focus mainly on the peak amount generated, as this figure will show the strength of the results you can attain. Don't forget you can also point to the achievements of your team as an indicator of profit generation. If you've coached and developed sales teams that generate significant profit increases over that of peers in other divisions, use these dollar figures to speak volumes about your leadership abilities and value as an employee.  
 2. Gather Data On Cost Savings 
 One of the most straightforward ways to demonstrate your worth, cost reductions are a valuable way to call attention to your ability to widen profit margins. Employers are always interested in those who can generate additional profitability—especially when it means they don't have to produce more revenue. Even if you're in a role that doesn't traditionally focus on cost—say, information technology—it still makes sense to note where and when you've been able to renegotiate contracts or add efficiencies that reduced expenses. If you constantly monitor the bottom line in your department, here's where you can use this tendency to your advantage. Consistent cost savings that add up over time are worth mentioning on  a resume , especially if you can convert them to annual or year-over-year savings figures for increased impact. When mining your career history for cost savings, don't forget to look at systems you created. You may be able to ferret out information on how a new process or procedure trimmed more costs over time. 
 3. Demonstrate Your Financial Authority 
 The depth of your experience is a key factor in the decisions  hiring managers  will make about your background. Employers tend to reason that, if you've held a certain level of authority in the past, then you can be trusted to handle duties of equal or greater size in the future. The most easily defined monetary measures of this type of responsibility are budgets. The size of a budget often dictates the relative importance of a business unit to the company. When you've taken on the task of budget administration, you are also demonstrating your value as an astute financial steward. In other words, including a sizable budget figure on your resume will tell an employer a lot about your current and potential leadership abilities. Another area to be assessed is the size or budget allotment for any projects or special initiatives, in addition to a company's routine operating expenditures. If you've led a large-scale, global effort for your employer, chances are that its budget was of the same proportion. Noting this budget figure in your resume gives you an edge over candidates who have yet to control a project of this magnitude.  
 In summary, the dollar-driven resume is one of the best tools available to an executive or professional seeking a new role in today's competitive market. Adding dollar figures to your resume not only helps to verify your strongest skills, but it also shows employers the ROI they can expect when selecting you to fill an open position.
