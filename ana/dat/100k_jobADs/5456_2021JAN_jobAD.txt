 Workwell team members are our most valuable asset. We use the three Rs for positive performance assessment: Reinforcement, Recognition, and Reward. As a result, workers feel good about themselves. They have a sense of satisfaction for being part of a “winning team.” Subsequently, we are proud to share that our current “years of experience” average is 12 years. 
 At Workwell Industries, we are committed to creating jobs for people with disabilities and others who experience barriers to employment. Further, with over a dozen different benefit programs, many team members receive full pay from the company. Our largest employee turnover comes from seasonal temporary workers. As a company, our objective is to continue healthy growth as well as maintain the best employer/employee relationship in the area. 
 Every team member, whether they have disabilities or not, is ready to use their skills to reach team goals. 
 Powered by their passion and tireless efforts, this unique blend of individuals completes our social and economic goals.
