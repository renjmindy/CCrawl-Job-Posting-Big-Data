 This internationally recognised Engineering and Manufacturing business is in a state of growth and investment and has big plans for 2020 with a strong order book and a long standing international customer base. As such they now require the support of an experienced and determined Planning and Logistics Manager who can lead a small but motivated team of Warehouse Planning and Logistics professionals to deliver best in class delivery and parts supply to the manufacturing teams and customers. 
 The Planning and Logistics Manager will be a key member of the management team and will be responsible for on time delivery of parts and materials as well as managing the shipping of finished goods externally. You will be responsible for translating a sales forecast into a production plan for the operation including all aspects needed to produce a finished part and achieving OTIF delivery for production while minimising working capital. Then you will communicate and coordinate the activities with all new product development programs, operations and material managements and will highlight the constraints. 
 The Planning and Logistics Manager will be the super user for the SAP / ERP system to drive compliance, champion, train and support development of line teams, ensuring effective material requirements planning and control that enables robust, high quality plans to be generated and reviewed, in line with customer demand. They need to create Master Production Schedules for the plant to meet customer requirements, whilst minimising cost and inventory to ensure company objectives are achieved. 
 The ideal individual will need to have a strong background in a manufacturing based planning and scheduling and preferably in a batch / low volume environment. An in depth understanding of capacity planning and MRP / ERP Master Production Scheduling will be a must as well as proven leadership experience within a production warehouse / logistics environment. Advanced Excel skills as well as a strong overall level of IT literacy will be highly advantageous and a proven knowledge of supply chain process will be a distinct advantage in this post. This could also suit a senior planner / logistics lead looking to take that next step in their career into a leadership level role. 
 If you feel that this could be a strong option for your career development and would like to learn more then please contact Matt Harris for a confidential discussion.
