 The ideal candidate will have strong training and research interests in Human Resources Management with expertise in Strategic HRM (e.g., HR planning, Compensation, High Performance Work Systems) and/or Talent Analytics. Training and research interests in Industrial Relations or micro-HRM would also be assets. Applicants must hold a PhD in Human Resources Management or related discipline (e.g. Industrial Relations, Industrial-Organizational Psychology) at the commencement of appointment. Responsibilities for this position include publishing in top tier research outlets, teaching in our undergraduate and graduate (i.e., MBA, EMBA, PhD) programs, doctoral supervision, and contributing to service and governance of the business school (e.g., serving on committees). 
 The successful candidate will develop and maintain a grants-supported program of research leading to publications in high quality journals. The DeGroote School of Business provides funding for research and conference travel, as well as a reduced teaching load during the first few years of the appointment. 
 The Department’s faculty members include Vishwanath Baba, Catherine Connelly, Rick D. Hackett, Benson Honig, Teal McAteer, John Medcof, Erin Reid, Joe Rose, Aaron Schat, and Willi Wiesner.

A sampling of the journals in which our faculty have published include Academy of Management Journal, Academy of Management Review, Strategic Management Journal, Organizational Studies, Organization Science, Journal of Management, Journal of Management Studies, Human Resource Management, Management Decision, Journal of Applied Psychology, Personnel Psychology, Journal of Organizational Behavior, and the Harvard Business Review. Several have served, or are currently serving, as Editor-in-Chief or Associate Editor, of influential journals in management, entrepreneurship, organizational behaviour and/or human resources management.
