 A person who is very comfortable with taking a person who is a subject matter expert and helping them to form their subject matter expertise into measurable blocks of content. So the content can be delivered to the subject matter expertâ€™s prodigies so they can learn more and gain skills from the content. 
 A learning consultant that will help to form all the content so we can see all the steps of what the prodigies are learning, how their experience is being gained, and a level of measurement and success for their activities. 
 Requirements:

Formal education in curriculum development. 
At least 5-6 years of learning consultant experience in a business setting, preferably a high tech setting.
