 Elder Care Jobs in Canada 
 Posted on  February 12, 2009  by  caregiver 
 A Canadian caregiver recruitment agency whose main objective is to recruit the most qualified caregivers from around the world is seeking qualified applicants to fill the caregiver needs of their clients. With an international network of affiliate offices, they aim to help Canadians find the right caregivers for their families by providing them with the perfect candidate for their elder care needs using their cutting-edge video resume system. 
 Most of their clients are willing to be a caregiver work abroad sponsor and the Canadian immigration process wouldn’t be much of a problem. That’s because the agencies founder himself is a Canadian immigration lawyer and has helped thousands of people immigrate to Canada since 1991.
