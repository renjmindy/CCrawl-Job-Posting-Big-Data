 Make Zalando the best high quality Marketplace in the Fashion Industry üëï 
 Role overview 
 We are looking for a Software Engineer (Backend) to join our team and secure the growth of Zalando marketplace. 
 In our pillar, we are responsible for the ‚ÄúArticle lifecycle management‚Äù where we take care of every single item our Partners want to sell on the Zalando Platform, making sure that the data is clean, correct and the ‚Äúarticle‚Äù goes live seamlessly. Managing all the information behind these articles is not an easy task. 
 And neither is ensuring that the right price and stock levels are 100% accurate all the time - we provide all this essential service for our partners, supporting them to become profitable fast. 
 We therefore operate a large number of software systems, all working together in an orchestra of microservices. Like a concert. The performance of our systems is vital for both Zalando and our consumers, therefore we put a lot of effort into building them steady, reliable and strong from the get go or tweak their performance on the run. 
 Our software products are built with Scala, using the functional programming aspect of the language, deployed as microservices, on AWS and with the ‚Äúhelp‚Äù of Kubernetes. We handle, for example, thousands of new articles and millions of price updates per day. 
 Please read more about our business unit by visiting our  Intro Page - here . 
 WHERE YOUR EXPERTISE IS NEEDED 
 
 Create highly scalable solutions and own the entire development cycle - from architecture design to implementation, testing and maintenance. 
 Own your code and decide on the technologies and tools to deliver as well as operate large-scale applications, based on a microservices architecture. 
 Take an active role in understanding business requirements and translating them into technological solutions. 
 Play a leading part in evolving and scaling our systems as per our business demands. 
 Own service operational duties, including monitoring and keeping them up running and healthy 
 ‚ÄúSolve something that matters‚Äù - solve business problems in the best possible way, while being a highly dynamic team which embraces change. 
 Contribute to the tech community within the department as well as on company level; take an active role in onboarding new team members and mentoring junior colleagues. 
 
 WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR 
 
 A solid grasp of computer science fundamentals combined with a strong capacity of solving complex problems with roughly 5 years of hands-on software development in a commercial setting. 
 Experience with designing and building microservices in one of our preferred technologies, like Scala (we use cats-effect) or any other functional programming language. 
 Cloud architecture experience (preferably but not limited to AWS and Kubernetes). 
 "You build it, you run it" approach: experience managing services end-to-end, from developing to deploying to monitoring and incident support. 
 Knowledge in architecture/design methods and patterns, data and API specifications, quality assurance and testing methods. 
 
 Great communication skills in English. 
 WHAT WE OFFER 
 
 Culture of trust, empowerment and constructive feedback,  open source  commitment, meetups, game nights, 100+ internal and fun guilds, knowledge sharing through talks, internal tech academy and  blogs , product demos, parties and events 
 Competitive salary, employee share shop, training platform and training budget, free language courses (English / German), pension scheme, 40% Zalando shopping discount on most products from our catalogue, discounts from external partners, centrally located offices, public transport discounts, municipality services, great IT equipment, flexible working times, additional holidays and volunteering time off, diverse sports and health offerings 
 Extensive onboarding, mentoring and personal development opportunities and access to an international team of experts 
 Relocation assistance for internationals, PME family service and parent & child rooms* (*available only in selected locations) 
 
 We celebrate diversity and are committed to building teams that represent a variety of backgrounds, perspectives and skills. All employment is decided on the basis of qualifications, and business need.
