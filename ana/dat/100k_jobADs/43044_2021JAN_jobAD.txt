 Ownership of Monthly financial controls and reporting standards 
 Preparation of details financial analysis 
 Business partnering with budget holders for areas of cost responsibility 
 Continuous review of financial processes 
 
 As the successful Financial Accountant, you will be a qualified Accountant, with a good technical accounting background, strong academics and an ambitious and driven personality 
 A background in audit or internal controls would be highly advantageous, though not essential. 
 The Financial Accountant we seek will be highly numerate, analytical and thorough, able to work on your own initiative, and able to manage a number of projects simultaneously. You will be a self-starter, who enjoys problem-solving, and providing solutions.
