 About 1build 
 We're a team that's committed to intellectual honesty. We help each other get better through open discussion and respectful feedback. 
 We are passionate about creating a world where beautiful buildings are designed and built by algorithms. 
 About the role 
 Skills:  Go, Kubernetes, React, TypeScript, Amazon Web Services (AWS) 
 1build helps construction companies convert blueprints into bids and shopping lists of construction materials. We are serving a market of 3 million builders with a cost estimation software product and a marketplace for cost estimation services. As we're collecting thousands of datapoints about construction projects in the US, our ultimate goal it to standardize construction data and to codify building assembly and design as an explicit algorithmic language. 
 Having completed $500M in construction projects in 2020, we are looking for an experienced Head of Engineering who will be joining at a critical inflection point in our company’s growth. You will be helping to scale our platform to 1000s of construction businesses by year-end. 
 You will be joining as an executive leader alongside a team with experience at Tesla, Uber, Apple, WeWork and Samsara. We have recently closed a $5.5M seed round from top venture funds like Y Combinator, Initialized Capital, and co-founders of PlanGrid. 
 Your responsibilities will include: 
 
 Managing, coaching, and recruiting a diverse team of engineers across timezones 
 Interpreting product specs and designs for technical implementation 
 Making architectural decisions that can support the platform at scale 
 Setting and maintaining a culture of product excellence 
 
 About you: 
 
 You are highly driven individual who’s excited about turning scrappy startups into industry leaders 
 Cross disciplinary thinker & lifelong learner who loves to dig into the nuts and bolts of the challenges at hand 
 Player-coach who is able to lead effectively through coaching and help unblock your teammates when faced with technical challenges 
 
 Requirements: 
 
 6+ years of work experience as a software engineer at fast growing companies 
 Past experience leading and scaling high-output software engineering teams 
 Significant Dev-Ops & Cloud Computing (AWS preferred) experience with tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Consul, Envoy, Serverless & more 
 Experience designing, shipping and maintaining large B2B SaaS products & APIs powered by gRPC, GraphQL & REST 
 
 Technologies we work with: 
 
 Python 
 Go 
 React 
 TypeScript 
 Kubernetes 
 Terraform 
 
 Technology 
 We are creating an assembly language for construction that can convert high-level building blueprints into machine-readable algorithmic instructions on how to build. 
 Typical engineering challenges can include: 
 
 creating a script that calculates how long it takes to assemble an interior partition wall 
 cataloguing different lumber materials by application in construction 
 developing a graphical interface that allows point-and-click vectorization of construction plans
