 I’M PULLING A RACHEL GREEN AND GETTING ‘THE FEAR’ OR HOLY SHIT I’M ABOUT TO QUIT MY JOB, A JOURNEY. PART 2. OF MANY. 
 Posted on  May 7, 2017  by  survivingthefog  under  Uncategorized 
 I wrote Part 1 at the end of March before I handed my notice in, and found it still in a draft- 19th April. So I posted it, because it's better late than never, right? Wrong. I read through it and none of it makes sense because I posted it so late. 
 Let me back up a little bit. 
 I handed my month's notice in on the 1st April this year, with no plans for the future. It was terrifying and exhilarating, and I knew that I'd made the right choice because of the intense wave of relief that I felt. 
 Within two weeks, I: 
 
 Applied for, and was accepted onto, a Psychology Conversion Masters Course at uni. I'll essentially be doing a three year degree in one year; 
 Had an interview for and have been asked to start volunteering for a local befriending and mentoring service, working with people with low level mental health and learning difficulties. 
 
 It's now the 7th May, and I finished work a week ago. 
 I. Feel. Amazing. 
 I've just about started to fully relax into myself. I still have this lingering anxiety that I should be going back to work tomorrow, and this residual guilt that I'm enjoying myself. Maybe that's left over from the Catholic upbringing. 
 I'm already starting to get a little bit scared about September, I'm a huge procrastinator, hence the sporadic blog posts. When I think about what I want from next year, I see this really productive girl, sitting in a coffee shop, typing away with an open textbook and a pen in her mouth. I hope I actually become that girl.
