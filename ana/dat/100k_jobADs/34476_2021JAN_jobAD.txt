  Full-time Job & Internship at the Same Time?  
 Work It Daily 
 May 26, 2010 
 Dear Experts, I currently have a full-time job but I'm in desperate need of more money. So, I applied for a part-time/paid internship with a family-friend to help pay the bills. I really like my full-time job and would consider it a priority compared to the internship. With that being said, do I owe it to my manager to inform her of me taking on another line of work?  Here is how our CAREEREALISM-Approved Experts answered this question on Twitter:   Q#490  I would check your contract first to ensure that you don't have a clause excluding second jobs. (@ gradversity )  Q#490  If your p-t internship does not interfere with full-time job, you probably do not need to explain to employer. (@ keppie_careers )  Q#490  A Full-time Job & Internship at the Same Time? Depends on:  http://bit.ly/9lhSjH  (@ ravingredhead )  Q#490  Reality is challenging. Do what you have to make your ends meet. If second job doesn't conflict, why inform? (@ DeborahShane )  Our Twitter Advice Project (T.A.P.) is no longer an active campaign.
