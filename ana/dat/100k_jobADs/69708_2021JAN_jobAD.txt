 someone else's job 
 Posted on  July 10, 2017  by  gretchenr17 
 Have you ever had a situation where you were just  certain  that you were supposed to complete a task, only to find out that God had someone else in mind? There are times when we get our heart and mind so set on what we perceive as God's plan, that we forget that it is God who decides, not us.  A man’s steps are established by the Lord, 
and He takes pleasure in his way (Psalm 37:23). 
 Whether it is in ministry, leading someone to Christ, or even the future spouse of a person, we often have our opinion, but it is God who has the plan.  A man’s heart plans his way, 
but the Lord determines his steps (Proverbs 16:9).  Over the years I have heard stories of people who were led to Christ by someone others had never expected. Couples who were engaged, only to have the engagement broken and someone else became the bride or groom. Stories of people who were missionaries only to be called back and someone else was sent to continue the work. All different situations, but still the same because God was directing their steps. 
 We can be so busy trying to do someone else's job, that we miss out on the tasks God has set aside for us to do. First Corinthians 12:4-6 describes this perspective well, _ There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit distributes them. There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord. There are different kinds of working, but in all of them and in everyone it is the same God at work._ 
 When we try to run ahead of God, believing "we've got this" and forget to walk  with  God we will miss out on the times when things change. First Corinthians 12:11,  All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he distributes them to each one, just as he determines.   He  distributes them to each one, just as  he  determines. God is the decision maker of the gifts and tasks we are given. When we try to take over another person's tasks then we are leaving our tasks unattended. 
 Best Beloved,  let us seek first His kingdom and His righteousness and the rest will be added to us (Matthew 6:33). Let Him lead us, we will never be sorry when we follow (Matthew 16:24).
