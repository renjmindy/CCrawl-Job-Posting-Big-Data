 Many think that depression is just being overly sad, but it is more serious than that.  Psychiatry.org  defines depression as a serious and quite common medical condition that affects not only your feelings but your actions and thinking as well. It can turn one’s life in the opposite direction. 
 With depression, one can feel a lack of interest in activities that were enjoyed before, loss of energy in doing different activities, mood swings, irritability, changes in one’s appetite, difficulty sleeping, or sleeping too much. If you are experiencing some of these symptoms, try this online  depression assessment  test led by psychologist Dr. Margarida Rafael. Depression symptoms may vary from person to person. Nevertheless, it is treatable. 
 Finding a job is no easy task. It becomes even more challenging if you suffer from depression. Due to the stigma attached to depression, there are not many advertised jobs for depressed people. Contrary to what many believe, people with depression can still perform different tasks, moreover, excel at work; it is a matter of choosing the most suitable job depending on your situation and condition. 
 Careers for People with Depression 
 The fast-paced busy work environment is the norm; the early wake-up time, the morning rush getting to the office, numerous meetings with colleagues and clients, and rushing home again at sundown—these are what most office workers go through day in and day out. 
 However, this kind of setup isn’t for everyone. People with depression will most likely dread going to work as they can instantly feel overwhelmed by these situations. The hectic routine can also cause one to feel drained from work. To check if you are experiencing burnout, take this  burnout assessment  test and address your feelings properly to avoid any serious conditions. 
 With the common work schedule, someone depressed might end up choosing not to work at all. Jobs with a much calmer environment can change a depressed person’s perspective about work. Here are some of the best jobs for someone with depression: 
 1. Librarian 
 Bookstores and libraries tend to be filled with people, yet still, remain reasonably quiet. This job is good for people with depression because it works for people who can still mingle with others, and for those who prefer to be alone. If you have depression but you can still manage to interact with other people, recommending books to customers will satisfy you. 
 Being surrounded by books and like-minded people will help improve your mood. If you are someone who doesn't like much interaction with people, keeping the books in order or labeling books and sections of the library will give you a great sense of accomplishment too. There’s nothing better than seeing all books properly aligned, and in their designated places. Doing this will also lessen your interaction with other customers as everything can be easily located. 
 2. Writer 
 As a writer, you get to be alone with the words, create and be part of an interesting world. You can relax and practice your imagination while at work. You can take jobs that only interest you. This job can also be done anywhere. If you get more inspiration from being in the outdoors, you can. Grab your pen and paper, or your laptop and head to the nearest park. You get your daily dose of nature, which will instantly brighten your mood, and get your work done. 
 With the new normal work set-up, if possible, put your table near a window so you can see a bit of nature, the changing of the weather, or the sun while you work. Being surrounded by nature has been proven effective in boosting one’s mood. If this is not possible, try simple steps like changing your computer wallpaper to a nature photo, or you can check out these  photos and videos of nature  during your work break to help you relax and calm your nerves. 
 3. Freelancer 
 Since almost everything has been shifted to the world wide web, it’s a good time for you to start freelancing. If not all, most of your interactions will be done via the exchange of messages online. There are a variety of jobs you can try like designing logos, writing articles, organizing events, and the list goes on. You can choose your niche and you won’t have to feel pressured to do things you don’t like. If you prefer teaching, some schools or academies offer teaching or tutoring. You can choose the jobs that you truly enjoy. 
 Freelancing also entails you to choose your desired work time. This way, you won’t feel pressured to report to work early in the morning and clock out late. You can sleep in if you are not an early riser, or work at night if this suits you more. 
 4. Dog Walker/Pet Sitter 
 Aside from being surrounded by nature, mingling with animals brings positive effects. You get to share the care and love to the animals, and you get to receive them too. Animals tend to have a sweet and playful nature, which can make you feel warm and happy. Other than the usual giving of food, water, and treats, you can also take the dog for a walk outside. You can hit two birds with one stone as you get to do your job while getting yourself some much-needed break with nature. 
 5. Florist 
 This is yet another nature-related job combined with art or creativity. Being surrounded by different colors of flowers can instantly make someone feel lighter. 
 The aroma of some flowers like lavender can also help you feel relaxed and calm. Also, this job requires you to unleash your creative side. Putting together a bouquet is not easy, but once done, your beautiful piece of work does not only bring you pride but it also gives joy to the receiver. It’s a win-win situation. 
 6. Park Ranger 
 Being a park ranger requires you to be in the outdoors more compared to other jobs. Some park ranger jobs do need certification or specific knowledge about the parks you would be protecting, while some offer training. You can choose which you prefer, and enjoy your work with the usual peaceful environment. With this job, you also get to impart your knowledge to visitors. 
 7. Creative Work (artist/ crafter) 
 Much like freelancing, jobs in the art industry do not always require a routine schedule. Getting creative can also help uplift your feelings. If you are good at drawing, painting, photography, videography, or editing, you can try selling your art, take commissions for business logos or art decors, or provide your services. You can make or negotiate for the terms and conditions, so you can work at your own pace.
