 Looking forard - goals for 2012 
 Leave a reply 
 During the last 3 months of 2011, I was learning and enhancing my knowledge of Javascript, CSS, and HTLM(5). I have also been looking forward, thinking about what I want to accomplish this year. Up until now, a large percentage of my efforts have been put into gaining awareness. For me, 2012 is about taking the next step, branching out, and getting significant hands on experience in a bunch of new stuff. These are my personal-professional goals for 2012: 
 
 Learn the following databases: MongoDB, Neo4j, Casandra 
 branch into iOS development (iPhone and/or iPad). Create and publish at least 3 apps. 
 build my own Django app and get it running on a home web server. (I have an idea for this, just needs implementing. It may be the subject of future posts.) 
 Use HTML5/CSS3 as much as possible. 
 Get better with Python and learn some new python packages: NumPy, SciPy. 
 Go to one tech related conference. 
 Get better at networking. (I've found this somewhat difficult here in Champaign, IL) 
 Increase my monthly blog post rate to at least 3 blog posts per month. 
 
 Here we go 2012!

 The other day, I stumbled across this blog post on twitter: " Don't Call Yourself a Programmer ". It starts with the following: 
 
 If there was one course I could add to every engineering education, it wouldn’t involve compilers or gates or time complexity. It would be Realities Of Your Industry 101, because we don’t teach them and this results in lots of unnecessary pain and suffering. This post aspires to be README.txt for your career as a young engineer. 
 
 then launches into a number of examples. I think the most notable pieces of advice were the following: "  Don’t call yourself a programmer  " (define yourself in terms of your accomplishments, not your tech skills), "  Networking: it isn’t just for TCP packets  " (awareness and good-will does one wonders), and "  Modesty is not a career-enhancing character trait  ". I found most of his points refreshingly articulating things I have come to over the past six years - but lately, I have found myself working on these three more than others. 
 I highly recommend reading this article.
