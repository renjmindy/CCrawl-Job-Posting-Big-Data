I ultimately became the Vice President of Diversity for that organization. After I left that company I started my own motivational speaking and coaching business to help people and pets have healthier, happier lives. I completed my training in an International Coach Federation accredited coaching training program (iPEC) and was certified at the Associate Certified Coach level by the International Coach Federation. I also received my Doctorate in Veterinary Medicine from the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine and my Bachelor of Science in animal science from Cornell University.
