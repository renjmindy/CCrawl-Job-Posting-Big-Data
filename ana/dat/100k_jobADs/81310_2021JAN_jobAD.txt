 Initial jobless claims came in at 840,000 for the week ending October 3, according to the  U.S. Department of Labor . Economists had been expecting 825,000 new claims, according to a Dow Jones survey. 
 However, it was the lowest level of weekly claims since March when the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic. 
 WorkingNation is always looking at stories addressing how different states are trying to get unemployed people back in the workforce.
