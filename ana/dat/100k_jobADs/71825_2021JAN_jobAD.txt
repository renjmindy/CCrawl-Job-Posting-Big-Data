 “Just a quick note to let you and the team know how happy and satisfied Mick and I are with Workshope Software. It’s perfect for our Transmission/Mechanical business. Makes office duties so simple, and serves a lot of time on record keeping, which leaves me more time to get our new business marketed and running efficiently. Workshop Software can be used with ease, even my 9 year old son begs to record parts and invoice our customers. Only been using Workshop Software for a short time, and I’m totally hooked! Thanks so much guys ? ” 
 Tina Arnett 
 Great Lakes Transmission & Auto

 “I love the booking diary! Its an amazing feature that gives you the ability to know what’s coming in and out at what time and what jobs are coming up.” 
 Nerelle 
 Viper Installations 
 “Workshop software was recommended to me by another independent workshop owner, I started with the 14 day trial as most people would. Being a new business owner, I feel it has compressed the amount of paperwork that I expected to have, even my accountant is impressed. It shows me up to date analysis of my earnings, and no parts are left unaccounted for. My customers have also pointed the professionalism of the invoices as the previous owner was all paperback. I would highly recommend this product to workshop owners like myself.” 
 Nick Thomas 
 Ashmore RWC and Automotive Services 
 “I researched lots of software programs for my new business but they all seemed the same with cluttered screens and complicated operating procedures. I was instantly attracted to Workshop Software’s clean appearance, ease of use and flexibility. The guys have been very helpful and tolerant of my stupid questions.” 
 David Restall 
 AutoCentre Gold Coast 
 “We love Workshop Software. It simple and easy to use. The updates that are coming out are great. We always recommend Workshop Software to others in the industry.”
