 Job Fair Prepares Individuals for New Careers 
 The 2018 Annual Partners Job Fair was held at Shorter College on April 24, 2018. 
 The event attracted over 45 employers, colleges, and local organizations that conducted on-site interviews, accepted resumes, and distributed resourceful information to over 100 attendees. 
 Vendors included Wyndham Hotel, Department of Human Services, Division of Service for Blind, Little Rock Fire Department, City of North Little Rock, Central Arkansas Development Council, Arkansas Rehabilitation Services, Arkansas Department of Workforce Services, Welspun, Arkansas Department of Transportation, and Arkansas Federal Credit Union. 
 The event provided attendees with the opportunity to meet with agencies about available services, speak with employers, and allowed them to take steps toward gaining employment, and for some, even being hired. 
 Overall, the event was a success and provided opportunities to make networking contacts with the local companies, agencies, and potential participants.
