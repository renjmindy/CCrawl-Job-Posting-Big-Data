 Come join LIN/BCS/CS/CLS at Rochester: jobs in 'Big Data' 
 Posted on  November 8, 2013  Updated on  November 8, 2013 
 The  University of Rochester  has recently announced a  Big Data  initiative. As part of this initiative, there will be a large number of faculty openings over the next few years, including potential hires in computational linguistics, computational neuroscience, computational psycholinguistics, etc. The first ** tenure-track positions  **are now posted. Have a look at this  list of departments and  areas in which we are searching . Please spread the word. 
 Let me know if you have questions about these searches. If you're a language researcher, make sure to check out the  list of language faculty at Rochester  (the beautiful mixture of hospital and vomit colors is about to be replaced by something more post 20th-century).
