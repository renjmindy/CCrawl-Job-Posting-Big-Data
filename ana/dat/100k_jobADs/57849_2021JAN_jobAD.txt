 Software tester (m/f/d) with development tasks for test automation 
 Do you have a penchant for quality and automated testing? 
 Your tasks 
 You develop so-called qualification kits. A qualification kit is an add-on product for SW development tools that allows users to test and document the correct operation of these tools in their environment. You will learn how to handle safety standards, such as with the ISO 26262, with the DO-330 or with the IEC 61508, which are indispensable in the development of modern technical software in cars, airplanes or complex technical systems. 
 In the process of creating these qualification kits, you perform the following activities: 
 
 Identification of functions of the tool in coordination with tool users and / or the tool manufacturer 
 Analysis of potential errors, detection and avoidance measures 
 Conception of a test strategy and development of the associated test cases 
 Configuration of a test execution environment and the execution of the test cases 
 Analysis of test results 
 Verification and validation of the created qualification kit according to safety standards
