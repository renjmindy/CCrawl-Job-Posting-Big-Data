 Miracle: Pope Francis Gets It Right! -> 
 Dubia: Sign The Petition Asking Francis To Do His Job! 
 Nov 19 
 Posted by  Mundabor 
 "Not the petition, too…" 
 LifeSiteNews has posted a  petition of support to the Cardinals asking Francis to answer the  dubia.   
 This is another of the tragicomic aspects of these days: faithful having to ask Francis to do his darn job and confirm the faithful in the faith. 
 You might say: it's a useless petition, because he will do what he likes anyway. 
 My answer would be: it's a useful petition, because he exposes Francis and keeps the attention on the dubia and the situation of, in fact,  suspended heresy declaration  for  Amoris Laetitia. 
 I invite you to have fun and sign the petition. Contribute with you little, honest nail to the coffin of this disgraceful Pontificate. 
 Francis work and legacy do not deserve any (ahem) mercy. This pontificate must be nuked. Nothing must remain of it that a faithful Catholic would even remotely consider. You can give your little contribution to the post-Francis reconstruction whilst the man is still breathing. 
 Please consider signing the petition.

 Of course! Signed and shared already! 
This petition is also a good way to see how many faithful and brave Catholics actually are today.

 Thank you for linking to the petition. I am going to reaffirm my rigidity in calling black black, and in loudly proclaiming my intolerance for separation of faith from life, as soon as I post this. 
 Let us inform the Evil Clown that our Lord in His goodness and love gave as His commandments, because life without them is messy. The clown's "philosophy" of "Life of the flesh is messy, let is get rid of the God-given order and create our own laws, geared toward indulging the flesh and creating more mess" is no match for the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 
 Jorge Bergoglio, over my dead rigid body!

 "What Catholics Once were…" 
 
 
 "What Catholics once were, we are. If we are wrong, then Catholics through the ages have been wrong. 
We are what you once were. We believe what you once believed. 
We worship as you once worshipped. If we are wrong now, you were wrong then. If you were right then, we are right now". 
 Robert DePiante

 Pope XII: "Suicide Of Altering the Faith In Her Liturgy….." 
 
 
 "I am worried by the Blessed Virgin's messages to Lucy of Fatima. This persistence of Mary about the dangers which menace the Church is a divine warning against the suicide of altering the Faith, in Her liturgy, Her theology and Her soul. … I hear all around me innovators who wish to dismantle the Sacred Chapel, destroy the universal flame of the Church, reject Her ornaments and make Her feel remorse for Her historical past. 
"A day will come when the civilized world will deny its God, when the Church will doubt as Peter doubted. She will be tempted to believe that man has become God. In our churches, Christians will search in vain for the red lamp where God awaits them. Like Mary Magdalene, weeping before the empty tomb, they will ask, 'Where have they taken Him?'" 
 Eugenio Pacelli, future Pius XII. 
 Roche, "Pie XII Devant L'Historie", p. 52-53 
 
 
 G.K. Chesterton: Malice & Spite 
 
 
 "If a critic tells a particular lie, that particular lie can be pointed out. If he misses a specific point, that point can be explained. If he is really wrong in this or that, it will be on this or that that the insulted person will eagerly pounce. But “malice and spite” are vague words which will never be used except when there is really nothing to pounce on. If a man says that I am a dwarf, I can invite him to measure me. If he says I am a cannibal, I can invite him to dinner. If he says I am a coward, I can hit him. If he says I am a miser, I can give him half-a-sovereign. But if he says I am fat and lazy (which is true), the best I can answer is that he speaks out of malice and spite. Whenever we see that phrase, we may be almost certain that somebody has told the truth about somebody else." The Illustrated London News, 13 November 1909. 
 
 
 G.K. Chesterton: Dogma & Authority 
 
 
 The modern world will accept no dogmas upon any authority; but it will accept any dogmas on no authority. Say that a thing is so, according to the Pope or the Bible, and it will be dismissed as a superstition without examination. But preface your remark merely with “they say” or “don’t you know that?” or try (and fail) to remember the name of some professor mentioned in some newspaper; and the keen rationalism of the modern mind will accept every word you say. 
 
 
 G.K. Chesterton: Progress & Fashion 
 
 
 The world is what the saints and the prophets saw it was; it is not merely getting better or merely getting worse; there is one thing that the world does; it wobbles. Left to itself, it does not get anywhere; though if helped by real reformers of the right religion and philosophy, it may get better in many respects, and sometimes for considerable periods. But in itself it is not a progress; it is not even a process; it is the fashion of this world that passeth away. Life in itself is not a ladder; it is a see-saw. 
 
 
 G.K. Chesterton: Tradition 
 
 
 “Tradition means giving votes to the most obscure of all classes, our ancestors. It is the democracy of the dead. Tradition refuses to submit to the small and arrogant oligarchy of those who merely happen to be walking about.” 
 
 
 Ronald Reagan & The Unborn Children 
 
 
 "NOW THEREFORE, I, RONALD REAGAN, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim and declare the unalienable Personhood of every American, from the moment of conception until natural death, and I do proclaim, ordain, and declare that I will take care that the Constitution and laws of the United States are faithfully executed for the protection of America's unborn children. Upon this act, sincerely believed to be an act of justice, warranted by the Constitution, I invoke the considerate judgment of mankind and the gracious favor of Almighty God. I also proclaim Sunday, January 17, 1988, as a national Sanctity of Human Life Day. I call upon the citizens of this blessed land to gather on that day in their homes and places of worship to give thanks for the gift of life they enjoy and to reaffirm their commitment to the dignity of every human being and sanctity of every human life". 
 Ronald Reagan 
Presidential Proclamation of "National Sanctity of Human Life Day", January 14, 1988 
 
 
 George W. Bush & Those Waiting To Be Born 
 
 
 “All human life is a gift from our creator that is sacred, unique and worthy of protection. On National Sanctity of Human Life Day, our country recognizes that each person, including every person waiting to be born, has a special place and purpose in this world”. [...] 
 “The most basic duty of government is to protect the life of the innocent. [...] 
 “The sanctity of life is written in the hearts of all men and women. On this day and throughout the year, we aspire to build a society in which every child is welcome in life and protected in law. We also encourage more of our fellow Americans to join our just and noble cause. History tells us that with a cause rooted in our deepest principles and appealing to the best instincts of our citizens, we will prevail.”
