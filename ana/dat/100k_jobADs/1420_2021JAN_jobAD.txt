 Spiritual Gifts are still for today. That's what my articles and fantasy book are all about. Each one has a Biblical message of some sort to help the hurting and to inspire believers.

 Category: Job 
 Mercy, Not Sacrifice (based loosely on the first chapter of the book of Job) 
 “I sacrifice, I sacrifice,” the righteous man did say. 
 “Long hours I toil to satisfy my darling’s needs each day. 
 This job consumes my life, dear, but I do it all for you, 
 From Monday up through Saturday, and now on Sundays too. 
 For me there is no Sabbath rest. I’m married to my work. 
 It has me in an iron grip. My work I dare not shirk. 
 You say you want my time, but I do not have it to give. 
 You see how hard I slave so that my family might live.” 
 And so, the man with fervor climbed his ladder of success, 
 Although the burden on his shoulders caused him much distress, 
 For when it came to serving God, he feared his kids might fail, 
 And that he never would reap any fruit from his travail. 
 He saw the way they partied. Had they cursed God in their hearts? 
 Then he must work to save them all from Satan’s fiery darts! 
 The best of his own toil and sweat this righteous man did pour 
 Into a fragrant offering that God could not ignore. 
 The best of all he had he sacrificed continually 
 That God’s forgiveness might rain down on them and set them free. 
 The man was truly duty-bound. He had no other choice. 
 Yet his own fleshly toil gave him no reason to rejoice. 
 For no blood of an animal could satisfy God’s law, 
 Because such sacrifices are not totally without flaw. 
 Nor can the righteousness of man atone for sinful pride. 
 It’s just like fig leaves, leaving him with no true place to hide. 
 Man’s best attempt at righteousness is like a filthy rag, 
 According to Isaiah. There 's no gold inside that bag. 
 How then can wasted time and talents ever be redeemed? 
 Not even he whose  name  was Job could come up with a scheme! 
 If even he, the man most upright, didn’t have the “stuff,” 
 Then how could anybody else attempt to do enough? 
 The truth is, God had His own plan which Job could not yet see, 
 Until one day he caught God’s notice unexpectedly. 
 Scriptures 
 Isaiah 64:6 Romans 3:23
