 How Dual Career Couples Can Thrive at Work and Home 
 Post-Workshop Resources 
 The Thrive Guide 
 Thanks so much for joining us in the workshop How Dual Career Couples Can Thrive at Work and Home 
 As promised, here is the resource kit to use as you explore and apply the ideas we discussed in the workshop. 
 ​ 
 The first section includes all of the experiments for each step of the process that we saw in the workshop. All those enticing live links are here for you to explore to your heart's content. (We did go through them quickly in the workshop!) 
 The second section will be new to you. It offers bite-sized habits you can develop on your own or with your partner.  Because those small wins are the way we make progress!
