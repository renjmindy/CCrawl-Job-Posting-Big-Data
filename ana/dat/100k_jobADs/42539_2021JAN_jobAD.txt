  3 Career Secrets Students Should Know Before Graduation  
 Ariella Coombs 
 January 03, 2017 
 Navigating a career can be challenging as a student or recent grad. The truth is, school teaches you everything EXCEPT how to get a job (and keep it). Not sure what to expect in the "real world"? You're not alone. Here are some career secrets YOU should know before you graduate: 
 
 1. Define your personal brand. 
 Everyone has a personal brand, whether you like it or not. Your personal brand is how other professionals perceive you. Your goal is to build a clear personal brand that showcases the problem you solve. That way, when someone (or some company) is having that particular problem, they'll know to reach out to you for a solution. Figure out the problem you solve and the skill sets you use to solve that problem. Then, promote it so people begin to associate you with those things. 
 2. Network constantly. 
 Building professional relationships in and outside of your field will not only allow you to learn more about the industry, but it will also increase your chances of networking your way into new opportunities. Make an effort to attend networking events, reach out to people on LinkedIn, and chat with professionals working in your industry on social media. You never know who someone knows, and you never know what opportunities will result from those connections. 
 3. Smile & and be enthusiastic. 
 Smile. Show enthusiasm. Have a good attitude. A positive outlook can go a long way in the business world. Professionals admire optimism in young professionals. If you're exuding a negative, snarky attitude about a job or job search, it will show. Make an effort to stay positive, even when it's hard!
