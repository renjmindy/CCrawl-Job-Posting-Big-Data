 JOBS IN WA 
 WorkPac Has Proudly Returned to Kalgoorlie 
 BY: Tracey Mesken01/11/2018 
 ​WorkPac are proud to be re-opening our doors in Kalgoorlie for the first time since 2012.​WorkPac’s Business Centre Manager for Kalgoorlie, Mr. Andrew Zafer, said the move was facilitated by a recent shift in the metal market.“We’ve been anticipating this boom for a while as rare earths generally follow the same pattern as Iron Ore, which has been starting to thrive again after winding back a bit over the past few years.”“We’re working predominately in the mining sector, but we’re also recruiting for waste management and a variety of trades roles including boilermakers, fitters, electricians, poly welders, drillers and driller offsiders”“We also have roles ranging from Fixed Plant and Loader Operators to administration staff, so I’d encourage anyone looking for work in the area to get in touch with the team about what’s available.”“Being the flagship business centre for Kalgoorlie, the office has been recently refurbished and we’re extremely proud of the space we’re working in.”“We’re in a fantastic, central location in town, so we’re very easy for locals to find” he said.WorkPac is well established in Western Australia, having opened our first business centre in Perth in 1997: since then we have opened an additional eight business centres in the State.With the reopening of Kalgoorlie, Mr. Zafer says the company will be further expanding services to both job seekers and clients in WA.“WorkPac already widely operates across Western Australia with Business Centres in Bunbury, Karratha, Newman, Perth, Port Hedland, Rockingham and Tom Price, and we look forward to continuing this work in Kalgoorlie”.“It’s also very important to us to contribute to the communities we operate in, and we’re excited to start reintegrating with the Kalgoorlie community”“We’ve hired a close-knit team to begin with, and we encourage those living within the region to get in touch with us.”WorkPac Kalgoorlie is located at Unit 2, 118 Brookman Street, Kalgoorlie, WA 6430, and is open Monday to Friday 8am to 5pm.Local job seekers and employers seeking workers in the Kalgoorlie region are encouraged to visit the office or call the team on 08 9099 9322.
