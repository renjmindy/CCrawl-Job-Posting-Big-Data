 Introducing: Librarian Job Ad Drinking Bingo! 
 A little end-of-the-day humor for my job-hunting librarian friends: here's Librarian Job Ad Drinking Bingo! 
 It's easy to play: just scroll through the postings on the  ALA JobList  site. Every time you see one these items below: a buzzword, a litany of preferred advanced qualifications, or one of those bullet points that just makes you think "WTF!" - take a drink! 
 If you get five in a row, shout out "Bingo!" You'll be sloshed in no time! (â€¦but as those ads say, my friends-please drink responsibly).

 All right, the latest job ad we posted had 3 of these: enthusiastic, part-time, and the 30 pounds thingie (WTF is so magical about 30 pounds btw?). Thanks for the laugh.

 30 lbs must be that magic number, cuz you know the only thing librarians do is just schlep books around all day, right? ðŸ˜‰

 I have seen these in one job ad or another over my career. Thanks for the smile and telling truth. Best, and keep on blogging.

 This is so spot it's freakish - which I mean in an entirely good way. THANK YOU for the laugh. I just got another rejection, and a humerous perspective on the absurdity of it all is just what I needed. (My personal favorite: "Three years' experience for entry-level job." Hahahahaha!)

 "This is so spot itâ€™s freakish" - should read as ""This is so spot  on  itâ€™s freakish." I guess I'm in editing mode vis-a-vis writing cover letter after cover letter. ðŸ˜‰

 I saw a 15 hr/week position and preferred qualification was an MLISâ€¦raise your hand if you can pay off a Master's degree working 15 hrs/week!

 Well this is just great!

 Brilliant. Glad I'm at the end of my career rather than just starting out.
