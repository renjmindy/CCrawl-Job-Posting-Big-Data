 Job Orientation Internship in Zanzibar 
 Are you unsure what you are really interested in and you want to try out different options? Our program "  Job orientation internship  " makes this possible! 
 On the tropical island of Zanzibar, you can  combine several short-term internship placements  of a minimum duration of 1-2 weeks each (depending on the internship) and thus gain first insights into different professional fields.  You do not need any previous knowledge or training/studies for these internships!  You can join from the age of 16. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Combine from the following options in Zanzibar: 
 Teaching: Kindergarten and School (minimum 1 week) 
 Kindergarten and school in Stone Town 
 In the kindergarten or school of St. Monica in the historic center of Zanzibar Town, you will support the local teachers in teaching. The children at kindergarten level are 4-6 years old and the school children 7-15 years. You can teach all subjects, the language used for teaching is English. You can also participate in administrative tasks. 
 Tour Operator (minimum 2 weeks) 
 Tourism internship with a tour operator 
 Zanzibar is a popular travel destination and tourism is by far the island's most important economic sector. The job of local tour operators is to book hotels and domestic flights, to offer airport pickups, and organize day trips such as visits to the spice plantations, historic tours of Stone Town, and sailing boat tours. As an intern, you will work in the office of a local tour operator in communication with customers, drawing up travel plans, making bookings and doing social media marketing. 
 Tropical Farm (minimum 1 week) 
 Tropical agriculture - educational program from a lecturer 
 In addition to his work as a farmer, Mr. Foum is also a lecturer at an agricultural training institute. He will work out a program for you so that you can see and learn as much as possible about tropical agriculture. Various tropical fruits and spices are grown on Mr. Foum's farm. In addition, Mr. Froum grows mushrooms and runs an exhibition and teaching area with a collection of interesting tropical plants. You can also visit and assist on other farms which cultivate tropical vegetables, rice (both on rain areas and irrigated areas), greenhouses, a tree nursery and coral rag farms which are farming the coral rocks in a collective economy. You can also visit the agrometerological station, the Kizimbani Agricultural Training Institute (KATI) and the Zanzibar Agricultural Research Institute (ZARI). 
 For the farm internship there is an additional contribution of 140 EUR per week (only for the first two weeks). 
 Marine biology - Marine turtle conservation (minimum 1 week) 
 Sanctuary for Marine Turtles 
 Are you interested in the oceans and their inhabitants? In Zanzibar there is a conservation project for sea turtles on the beach of Nungwi. Our biologist Rafael will give you an introduction to the work of a marine biologist and then you take part in the work at the sea turtle sanctuary, which includes rearing of turtle babies that are released into the ocean as soon as they reach a certain size. 
 For this internship placement an additional one-off fee for transport costs of EUR 100 applies (Zanzibar Town to Nungwi and back). 
 Biology - Protection of species and nature and local development work (minimum 1 week) 
 Sustainable development around Jozani Forest National Park 
 In the area of Jozani Forest National Park we carry out various environmental conservation activities directed by our biologist Rafael. The activities include the protection of reptiles, Red Colobus monkeys and sea turtles, promotion of environmentally friendly farming, and the planting of mangroves. The project also includes the development and operations of ecotourism with people from the surrounding villages as well as other local development work. You work with Rafael, local employees and foreign volunteers in various projects. 
 For this internship placement an additional one-off fee for transport costs of EUR 80 applies (Zanzibar Town to Jozani and back). 
 Fußball- und Sporttrainer (mind 1 Woche) 
 Football (Soccer), Athletics, Sports coach 
 Do you think you have what it takes to be a sports coach? With a football talent organization, you can train football on Saturdays and Sundays. On weekdays you can train the members of the Zanzibar Amateur Athletics Association in various athletic disciplines early in the morning and in the late afternoon, when it is not so hot, and you can also carry out other sporting activities at various schools and youth clubs. You can decide for yourself how intensively you want to get involved as a trainer and choose the sports. There are sports teachers at the facilities who can give you guidance for your internship. 
 And even more options to combine! 
 Mainland Tanzania is very close to Zanzibar and a completely different experience! To fly to our main location in Tanzania, Moshi/Kilimanjaro, just takes over an hour from Zanzibar. Moshi is a charming town on the foot of mighty Mt. Kilimanjaro and near to all Tanzanian world famous National Parks. We offer a selection of various  job orientation internships in Moshi . If you combine Moshi with Zanzibar, there are cheaper combination prices for our service package compared to individual bookings. Find details in the slider "Rates" below. 
 Full support before and during your time in Zanzibar! 
 In Zanzibar Town you will share an apartment with other international interns. In Nungwi you will stay in the bungalow of the sea turtle sanctuary directly on the beach. In Jozani the World Unite! Mother Nature Forest Camp will be your accommodation, together with other participants of our programs. In Zanzibar Town we have our own team members Abdi and Gabriel who are in constant contact with our participants. In Nungwi and at the Forest Camp in the Jozani Forest National Park area, we also have our own permanent employees taking care of you all the time. As a result, the job orientation internship is also very suitable for younger participants (from 16 years) for whom this is their first longer time abroad. You will of course also have a direct support person before and during your time abroad from our international office. 
 As a participant of our job orientation internship, you will get a discount of EUR 50 on our  Career Counseling Test !

They show their placements at the Cultural Arts Centre and Vikokotoni environmental group, their accommodation, visit their host family and explain various interesting aspects of their daily life in Zanzibar. 
 Zanzibar - Spice Island in the Indian Ocean 
 Zanzibar is a tropical island in the Indian Ocean. Zanzibar is about 2 hours away from the Tanzanian mainland by boat or 20 minutes by plane. When you research “Zanzibar”, it usually means the main island of Unguja. Unguja was very rich in the past, because the island was a major trading port along the sea routes between Africa, Arabia, India, East Asia and Europe. This can be seen today in the mixing of cultures, the Arab- Islamic influence, but is relatively liberal in Zanzibar. Today, tourism is the main source of income of Zanzibar, besides the cultivation of spices and tropical fruits. 
 Stone Town, the historic core of Zanzibar Town is the only intact historic coastal trading town in East Africa. Within the fascinating labyrinth of narrow streets full of small shops, souvenir shops, restaurants, hotels and hectic smaller places, it feels like one is in a dream of the "Thousand and One Nights”. Fantastically, there are also the heavenly white beaches and crystal clear waters with colorful coral reefs, which compete with the Caribbean or the Maldives in catering to wealthy tourists. Zanzibar Town, in addition to Stone Town have plenty of other neighborhoods like Kiembe Samaki, Mwanakwerekwe, Mbweni and others, in which many organizations have their offices and are active. 
 In addition, there are many villages along the beaches and in the interior of the island. 
 The biggest problem of the island is the overwhelming poverty of the population, whose only employment consists of cultivation and fishing for their own and thus, have no money, cannot afford education for their children, medical care, etc. A lack of education means that the following generations can hardly escape the vicious circle of poverty. Population growth, which is mainly due to immigration of people from mainland Tanzania, results in the exploitation of nature. 
 Things to do in Zanzibar 
 In Zanzibar, there is a wide range of excursions: day and half day trips include a visit to a spice plantation, the Jozani Forest National Park, the mangroves of Mungooni and Uzi, beach resorts such as Nungwi, Paje and Jambiani, a "Safari Blue”, sailing through the Menai Bay Conservation Area, Prison Island, the Island Chumbe Coral Park and a city tour of Stone Town, where there are lots of interesting souvenir shops, bars, cafes, regular concerts and even a handful of "clubs" and events. 
 In your spare time, you can also take music and dance lessons, yoga classes and interesting workshops by the Cultural Arts Centres participants in Zanzibar. 
 Many participants also travel to the mainland of Tanzania to do a safari or to climb Mount Kilimanjaro. You use our accommodation Moshi, Kilimanjaro at affordable prices to stay as a base for activities in northern Tanzania. 
 Getting There 
 Getting To Zanzibar 
 Several airlines fly directly or with an intermediate stop at Zanzibar (ZNZ). Remember to book your flight and share with us your flight details. From Zanzibar airport, we will pick you up and bring you to your accommodation in Zanzibar. 
 If the flights to Dar-es-Salaam (DAR) are much cheaper, you can also fly there. From Dar-es-Salaam, you can travel to Zanzibar by a connecting flight or take the ferry. We can arrange a transfer for you from the airport to the ferry for 30 EUR/35 USD. The ferry ticket costs 35 USD and the ferry takes about 2 hours. We will take you in this case from the airport to the seaport. In Zanzibar, you will be picked up at the ferry terminal and taken to your accommodation. A connecting flight from DAR to ZNZ only takes 20 minutes and costs 50-80 USD. 
 If your placement is on Pemba Island, you can either take a daily flight from Zanzibar to Pemba, or you can take a ferry (Azam Marine), which however doesn't have daily departures. In Pemba you will be picked up from the airport or ferry port and brough to your accommodation.
