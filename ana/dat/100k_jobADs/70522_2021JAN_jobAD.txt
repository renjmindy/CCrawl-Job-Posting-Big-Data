 Celebrities and international media gathered at Ballinacurra House, Kinsale, where Mark and Denise Duffield-Thomas from the UK and Australia, were chosen the Top couple for the Ultimate Job in Ireland – and probably the world! After a weekend of challenges and beating stiff competition, Mark and Denise Duffield-Thomas have landed the Ultimate dream job: 6 months of luxury travel around the globe for Irish wedding and honeymoon company Runaway Bride and Groom.com. 
 The Top 10 candidates came from Australia, US, Canada, South Africa, 
 Brazil, UK, Galway, Wexford, Sligo, Dublin and Cork to enjoy a full Kinsale dining and leisure experience at some of Kinsale’s top class restaurants, clubs and venues, such as Blue Haven, Hamlets Bar, White Lady Nightclub, Trident Hotel and Carlton Hotel. 
 Organised by RunAwayBrideandGroom.com, the Ultimate Job in Ireland – and probably the world! received 30,000 applications from over 90 countries and global media attention since launching on 19th February. 
 “It has been an amazing weekend for all people involved. Kinsale has been the Ultimate host town for the Top 10 couples and the judges,” says Runaway Bride and Groom managing director Rosemarie Meleady, also one of the judges. “The Top 10 have all worked incredibly hard not just to get to the final but also throughout this weekend, with all the tasks we have given them. Given the amount of talent displayed by all the contestants, the decision was a very difficult one but we are happy with the final result. We really hope to keep in touch with all the couples and we wish them the very best.” 
 Denise and Mark will immediately start preparing for their first trip after the announcement and will fly out at the end of May to Zanzibar, Mauritius and private escorted safari in Kenya – a week in each destination – just for starters. 
 “We have had the most amazing weekend in Kinsale and we hope to make you all proud as ambassadors for Ireland around the globe in the next six months,” they said.

 Kinsale to Host Final of The Ultimate Job 
 Kinsale, the gourmet capital of Ireland, is to host the final of The Ultimate Job in Ireland (and probably the world) on May 7-9. 
 The top 10 finalists will head to Kinsale, which is becoming known as Ireland’s Ultimate Wedding Destination, to face the Judging Panel and a range of tough challenges and interviews to decide who gets ‘The Ultimate Job’ of Honeymoon Tester. 
 **They will stay for the final challenge weekend at the stunning Ballinacurra House , the Exclusive Use Private Estate in Kinsale, well known as the ‘Irish home’ of Michael Jackson, prior to his death last year. ** 
 The couples will enjoy the full Kinsale dining and leisure experience, with challenges and tasks combined with sightseeing and fun time at some of Kinsale’s top class clubs and venues, such as Blue Haven, Hamlets Bar and White Lady Nightclub. 
 Ciaran Fitzgerald, Chairperson on Kinsale Chamber of Tourism is delighted with the impending influx of “honeymooners”! “Kinsale has everything that a couple would need to plan their ultimate wedding experience… from the romantic surprise engagement to the hen and stag parties right through to the big day and after. We also do great christenings!” 
 **Rosemarie Meleady, managing director of Runaway Bride and Groom , explains: ** 
 “Numerous locations in Ireland were vying for the opportunity to host the final but we decided to opt for Kinsale based on its many attractions of wonderful hotels and private estates, stunning harbor, great bars and restaurants, range of activities and ease of access. The Kinsale Chamber of Tourism was also very proactive in providing an equally exotic package of events for the Final Weekend that complement its reputation as a premium Wedding Destination as well the Gourmet Capital.” 
 The final interviews will take place on Sunday in the stunning surroundings of the Carlton Hotel after a little pampering to calm the nerves at the C Spa. 
 The chosen couple will be finally revealed on Sunday evening at a Gala Dinner at Ballinacurra House, with special guests and top entertainment. 
 The successful applicant and their partner will immediately start preparing for their first trip after the announcement and will fly out on 21st May to Zanzibar, Mauritius and private escorted safari in Kenya - a week in each destination – just for starters.  ****
