 The daily commute as an element of job satisfaction (or lack thereof) 
 May 1, 2017  By   David Yamada  in  experience of work ,  personal finances ,  psychology and work ,  travel  Tags:  experience of work ,  personal finances ,  psychology and work ,  travel   3 Comments 
 Do you factor in a daily commuting experience as part of your overall job satisfaction? If you don't, then maybe you should. 
 Shana Lebowitz writes for  Business Insider  on " how most of us underestimate just how miserable commuting can make us ." She cites research published in the Harvard Business Review: 
 
 That's according to a team of researchers writing in The Harvard Business Review. They cite multiple studies that suggest commuting can be more stressful than actually working, and that the longer your commute, the less satisfied you may be with your job and with life in general. 
 
 Her conclusion? "Reduce your commute. As in, move closer to your office or find a job closer to your home." 
 Urban commuter here 
 My commuting-to-work experiences have been exclusively by city subways. (I haven't owned a car since 1982!) I'm more than willing to exchange suburban home space for the experience of city living. 
 After graduating from law school, for years I made weekday subway trips from Park Slope, Brooklyn to lower Manhattan. My love affair with New York was still in full flower, so I dealt with the frustrations, delays, and packed subway cars with (somewhat) stoic patience. The average door-to-door commuting time was 40-50 minutes, but it often felt much longer because of the miserable rush hour experience. When I look back at those years, I'm surprised there weren't more displays of maniacal acting out by otherwise mature, sensible people! 
 For the past fourteen years, I've been doing subway trips from Jamaica Plain, Boston, to downtown Boston, where my university is located. The average commuting time is about 30-40 minutes, made much easier by the fact that a flexible work schedule allows me to largely avoid rush hour traveling. The biggest difference between this and my NYC subway experience is that I can usually get a seat on the train, which for me translates into opportunities to read a book, magazine, or newspaper. 
 Economic class impacts 
 However, I'm also cognizant of the fact that I've had some choices in this regard. In Greater Boston, for example, housing costs have driven more and more people into outer ring suburbs and beyond. Their lengthier commutes are often imposed upon them. Similar patterns are evident in other popular metro areas as well. 
 Of course, others choose to live in suburban areas, even if it means a longer work commute. Personally, I can't understand the appeal of suburban living, but many of my friends feel completely the opposite way! In any event, smoother commutes -- whether by car or by train -- would be good for everyone. If we use this research data to inform how we can improve the quality of lives overall, then we should invest in transportation systems that ease commuting experiences to and from urban centers.

 I know subways and streetcars can be brutal - but train rides are what you make them. I use them as a transition from home to work and back - a time to myself to reflect, read and plan how I will make the most of the day ahead at work or enjoy the evening ahead at home. I don't arrive at either location feeling out of control or stressed.

 Dave, I think the simple solution to this problem isâ€¦.live in Peoria! My commute is less than 5 minutes. Of course that doesn't give me much time to wind down from the job stressâ€¦â€¦.

 But Don, there's no subway! I'd have to buy a car! But at least I'd be able to invite myself over for banana pancakesâ€¦. ðŸ™‚
