 List SQL Server Agent JOBS in SQL Server 2008/2005/2000 
 May 27, 2009 -- riteshshah 
 As a DBA we may need to set the JOB for various task and those tasks will be saved under MSDB database. You can see it from EM or from SSMS GUI tools but it would help sometime to execute query to see the list of available JOB in SQL Server 2000+ versions. 
 There are two ways to achieve that task. Have a look at it. 
 -with stored procedure 
 EXEC MSDB..sp_HELP_JOB 
 -with sysjobs view 
 select * from msdb..sysjobs 
 Both of the above statements will give you list of JOB have been set in SQL Server Agent along with so many other important details.
