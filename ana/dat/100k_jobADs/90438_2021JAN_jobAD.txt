 Admiration Remains, Feelings Change 
 Nov 2 
 Posted by  hell0g0rge0us 
 
 Of course, people are going to speculate about a site, about an artist, about a fan. 
 For those wondering or worrying, please note: I have no intentions of shutting this site down. There are just too many good gems that I've written in the past six years to suddenly make inaccessible, and also too many good memories of David and being a fan of David. 
 I just have no plans to produce future content. 
 Unless David suddenly surprises me with a new song or album or musical event that sucks me right back in. 
 Until then, I'm just not on the same obsessive plane over the Voice that used to sustain me and this blog. 
 It happens. In real life or in fantasy, sometimes you just fall out of love with your idol (or simply, your bright shining light bulb sometimes grows dimmer). 
 There is no bitterness on my part, no dashed hopes. I've always felt that David Archuleta could have shone much brighter and could have had a place on the world stage. However, he himself tasted a bit of stardom, didn't care for it, and now he's content to live and make music under the radar and within the insular circle of his LDS faith. 
 He is still a phenomenal singer, but he has obviously retreated, and those of us who don't relate, we simply move on, like David has moved on. 
 I don't regret waiting and hoping for David's return to a high-profile music career after his two-year mission. But there have been other Soul David fans who left the fanbase the minute he left for Chile. They knew things were going to change, and they chose to move on. 
 Some of us just took a little longer to do the same. 
 At some point, the individual has to believe in his potential, has to WANT something bigger for himself, no matter how much others (like his dad) or his super fans proclaim over and over that he is destined for greatness. 
 He needs to believe it himself. And it is not a betrayal of humility to want greatness. His own parents, according to his memoir  Chords of Strength,  urged David to "not hide his light under a bushel." 
 Right now, David is shining his light in places that make him comfortable. Good for him! I'm shining my own light in other places. 
 This ride on the Archubus was great while it lasted. I bought all his CDs, his book, his Christmas DVD, paid VIP prices for his concerts. He was a pleasure to hear live, and his Voice will always be glorious. 
 However, that Voice no longer speaks to me, and I'm okay with that. He's not a malicious person, nor do I believe he would reject black female fans like myself (as someone had suggested just because he's Mormon - like, really?!). 
 People change, and feelings change. We've just drifted apart, and the fact that I'm okay with that - rather than falling apart into a million pieces - is the biggest clue to me that, whatever journey we were on as fan-and-artist, the passion is gone. 
 Sure, some folks will chalk that up to who was a "real" fan versus who wasn't. Think what you will. Because if I don't care about David's career anymore, I'm certainly not losing sleep over other people's opinions (baseless or otherwise). 
 Kudos to those of you whose passion for David still burns bright.

 Liking David vs. Liking David's Music 
 May 4 
 Posted by  hell0g0rge0us 
 So, more than half of those who voted in yesterday's poll on Soul Davidian voted for "Another Song" that they would love to hear David sing again. My own "other song" would have to be "And So It Goes" (see above) because I have yet to hear the Voice rock my soul and haunt my days in the way he did on that performance. 
 To be honest, I really had to think of some great standout songs from David. "Imagine" was too obvious a choice, so I went with others that have really defined him for the Archangels fanbase. I think this says a lot more about the musical output than it really says about David creating a signature sound or musical identity for himself. 
 Consider: very few of his fans voted to hear David sing "Crush" again, and that was his biggest hit. I think we can all appreciate "Crush" as the prerequisite pop song that Jive could make bankable cash on from a popular singer fresh off a popular TV show at the time. 
 But, in all seriousness: what real artistic development have we seen from David? Everything he's been able to establish for himself came from live performances, where his Voice could be witnessed by those who were fortunate to hear him. 
 It's why I could always write from a context of anticipation. I always anticipated the greatness of David, which emanated from the potential of the Voice, a greatness that I always felt was diminished or held back. Yes, held back. 
 His greatness was held back by a pop-confectioner label like Jive, then held back by Idol's 19E management that didn't want its runner-up outshining that year's winner, then held back by personal management that seemed to burn more bridges than build them in the music industry (if we want to believe various behind-the-scene rumors involving stage dads and the like), and finally, and perhaps most importantly, held back by David himself (limiting his artistic vision for religious fervor or for his own personal hang-ups). 
 In other words, David's fans have always been hungrier, more passionate about David grasping the brass ring than David himself seemed. We know his potential to transcend the heights, but in the end, an artist must have that dream for himself. I love me some David Archuleta and will always be in awe of his transcendent Voice, but I've always believed his artistry was greater than the musical output. I'm not the only fan who has felt this way about his original songs and albums. Such criticism isn't indicative of a "bad fan" but a genuine fan who knows what her idol is capable of and still awaiting his greatness to shine and be witnessed by the masses.

 The Plot Thickens

 David recording pop songs (not sacred music!), some in Spanish -  melting  - and apparently he was spotted at NBC's Universal Studios? 
 See? David has a plan! Whoever doubted? 
 Also, thank you Gladys, for translating David's Spanish Chat:  Read Here over at The Voice .

 Waiting in Vain? 
 Apr 23 
 Posted by  hell0g0rge0us 
 Is this the general consensus of Soul Davidians? That we've been waiting in vain? 
 Just hanging around wishing and hoping … and all for nought? 
 I don't know what's in store. And if there are new rumors (i.e. David planning to enroll in BYU next year), I will wait and see. 
 Just like I was wrong about the mission thing, I dare not suggest anything about David's prospects as far as college is concerned. 
 I do know this: 
 1. As someone who is deeply involved in overseeing Fall college admissions next year at  my  university (yep, that's why I haven't been as busy with this blog as I have in the past), I know that David couldn't just come back to the country late March and then decide he's going to enroll in the fall. Fall admissions for undergraduates have a deadline: typically late January/early February, UNLESS David is getting special treatment to enroll next year (which would annoy the heck out of me - given the recent  Supreme Court Ruling on Affirmative Action , which has failed to ensure an increase in the enrollment of minority students in higher education, and if certain folks encounter barriers to higher education, I'd like to know how  other  certain folks are able to transcend said barriers - ESPECIALLY since I never did hear anything about our Beloved completing his high school diploma or his G.E.D.). 
 2. If David is enrolling in college next year (for all we know he had applied then DELAYED matriculation before embarking on his mission), that would mean that he made these plans well ahead of his mission ending. 
 3. It's not even a full complete month since David's return from his mission, so I still believe PATIENCE is what we need to order from the menu. 
 Let us all wait and see.
