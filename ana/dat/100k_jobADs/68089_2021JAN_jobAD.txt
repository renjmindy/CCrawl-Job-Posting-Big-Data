 One of the most frequent question I get asked is,"Where can I find international work from home jobs?" 
 The answer isn't always easy to come by. The opportunities available to someone in the States will be different than someone in Nigeria. Even within the U.S. location matters! Some companies hire only in select states. 
 That's why it's hard, if not impossible, to come up with a list of worldwide work from home jobs. The truth is, there are companies that hire in many different countries, but not all. 
 So, I've set out to come up with this super MEGA list of 175+ international work from home jobs. I've also included websites that can be used for extra cash here and there like  survey sites  and  usability testing . 
 But I need your help. Please let me know in the comments if a link is broken or you find a company does or does not hire where you are. Together, we can come up with a bigger, better, more accurate list of international work from home jobs. Go teamwork! 
 International Work From Home Jobs with Distributed Workforces 
 The first logical place to look for international work from home jobs are distributed workforces. These are companies where all (or most) employees work remotely. This means the CEO can be in Japan while a designer lives in Costa Rica and a dozen of customer service reps are scattered throughout the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. 
 Remember: These companies may or may not hire in your specific region. Although they are distributed, not all companies hire in every single country.

 Freelance Websites for International Work From Home Jobs 
 No matter where you live, you can be a freelancer! That's why I'm always quick to recommend various  freelance websites  to jump-start a remote-friendly career. If you haven't had any luck finding international work from home jobs elsewhere, it may be time to give freelancing a try.

 Survey Sites for Worldwide Extra Cash 
 Let's be honest, you're not going to get rich from survey sites. But you can certainly earn some extra cash each month. The best part? There are a number of survey sites that offer opportunities to earn money online for people outside the United States! For a more comprehensive list (especially for those in the U.S.), check out my  20+ legitimate survey sites  that pay each month. 
 Swagbucks 
 Sign up and earn extra cash for market research, video watching, and (of course) surveys. Serviceable areas include Australia, Canada, Ireland, UK, and U.S. 
 Global Test Market  
 As the name suggests, Global Test Market is a market research company with a worldwide presence. Currently, they accept survey takers throughout 49 countries:

Indonesia 
Israel 
Italy 
Japan 
Malaysia 
Mexico | Netherlands 
New Zealand 
Pakistan 
Norway 
Philippines 
Poland 
Portugal 
Romania 
Russia

Spain | Sweden 
Switzerland 
Taiwan 
Thailand 
Turkey 
United Arab Emirates 
United Kingdom 
United States of America 
Venezuela 
Vietnam 
---|---|---|--- 
 Toluna 
 As I type this, Toluna accepts registration from users in approximately 46 different countries. You'll be able to see whether or not yours makes the list on the sign up page. 
 Harris Poll  
 While there seem to be more survey opportunities available to U.S. residents on Harris Poll, there are chances for international survey takers too! To date, Harris Poll has members answering surveys in more than 30 countries! 
 Micro Jobs & Short Task Sites for International Work From Home Gigs 
 Like survey sites, you likely won't make a full-time income from home with  micro jobs and short task sites . Nonetheless, they can be used for steady sources of extra cash month after month. Your best bet to make the most is to sign up for as many that are available to you. The more sites you belong to, the greater your chances are to earn. 
 Mechanical Turk  
 This mega marketplace of micro jobs, referred to as HITs, is brought to you by Amazon. That's right, the world's largest online retailer can also be a source of extra income each month. U.S. residents will have to register with Amazon Payments for tax purposes. Non-U.S. residents will have to provide tax information in order to receive payments. 
 ClickWorker  
 ClickWorker is always looking for worldwide users to work on a number of different short tasks. Projects include everything from surveys to data categorization and even web research. You can choose to get paid weekly or on a monthly basis. To get started, you'll have to go through assessments to show your skills. 
 CrowdFlower  
 CrowdFlower contributors work on tasks from around the world. The better your work, the more you'll earn. In fact, you can gain access to advanced tasks by becoming a skilled contributor! 
 OneSpace  
 At OneSpace, you'll gain access to hundreds of tasks that can range in complexity from simple QA to in-depth writing assignments. You'll create a workstation, and claim projects on a freelance basis. The best part? You can receive payments for approved work the very next day via PayPal! 
 International Work From Home Transcription Jobs 
 A good ear and fast typing skills can lead to steady work as  a transcriptionist. You can  start your own transcription business  from scratch or sign up with one of the many  companies that pay you to type from home . 
 How much you earn depends on the hourly rate of pay. Transcriptionists are typically paid by audio hour, that is for each hour of recording they transcribe (not the number of hours it takes them to transcribe it). So, let's say you're paid $20 per audio hour and it takes you 4 hours to transcribe a one-hour recording, you'd end up making $5/hour. Keep this in mind as you accept work as a transcriptionist! 
 AccuTran Global 
 Based out of Canada, AccuTran Global is always looking to contract with new typists. Assignments include general transcription, realtime stenographers, and voice writers. 
 CrowdSurf 
 CrowdSurf transcription tasks are claimed through Mechanical Turk. All tasks are short videos (15-35 seconds)  that need to be transcribed verbatim. 
 Transcribe Team 
 The average worker earns $132/month at Transcribe Team, but top earners can exceed $2,000 monthly. You can work as much or little as you'd like, so your earnings depend on you. 
 Rev 
 Video captions and transcription are the two main tasks available for worldwide workers at Rev. Read my full review of this remote-friendly company  here . 
 Quicktate 
 QuickTate has projects ranging from short voicemail messages to long conference calls. The application process can be lengthy, but can lead to steady work via QuickTate and their iDictate platform. 
 TranscribeMe 
 Want to monetize your downtime? TranscribeMe can help you do just that. You'll have to pass the exam before you can accept any paid tasks. 
 Scribie 
 Files are typically kept to under 6 minutes -- perfect if you want to earn money in your free time. To date, there are more than 16,000 transcriptions from around the world working for Scribie! 
 Speechpad 
 At Speechpad, you get to select the projects you work on, and there's never any minimum to claim each month. 
 CastingWords 
 All work is accepted and completed through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Each task comes with instructions on how it should be formatted. Make sure to follow these guidelines! 
 International Usability Testing Jobs From Home 
 Earn money just for speaking your thoughts out loud! I've used several  usability testing sites  over the years to make extra money online month after month. And, the good news is, many of these companies are open to testers from around the world! 
 UserTest.io 
 UserTest.io accepts testers in countries from Africa, Asia Pacific, The Americas, and Europe. All you need to do is record your thoughts as you're browsing a website. That's it. Accepted reviews will earn you $10 each. 
 UserTesting 
 Earn $10 for every 20-minute video you complete. Payments are issued via PayPal exactly one week after they're completed. Users located in Africa, Middle East, India, Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America, Caribbean, U.S., Canada, and Greenland are encouraged to sign-up and get testing! 
 WhatUsersDo 
 In as little as five minutes, you can get through the application process so you can start getting paid for your thoughts. You'll receive an email invitation every time as test is available to take. You can expect 3-5 tests on average each month. 
 uTest 
 You never know what kind of usability tests will come up at uTest. A recent project called for cricket enthusiasts in India, South Africa, and Australia! The only way to discover the tests available to you is to sign up. 
 Userlytics  
 The tests available to you depend on your demographics. The clients who submit usability tests can request specific testers based on their location, age, gender, etc. 
 International Search Engine Evaluation Jobs from Home 
 As a search engine evaluator you're tasked with rating ads, search results, or even social media. To learn more about what a search engine evaluator does and how you can be a successful one, read my  get-started guide for beginners . 
 Appen 
 Appen has a global network of workers that work on search engine evaluation projects. You could be their newest recruit! They're not always hiring in all countries, but do have opportunities available worldwide and in more than 100 languages. 
 Leapforce 
 There are opportunities for global workers to take on search engine evaluation tasks at Leapforce. To get started, you select your country and language to see the positions available for you. 
 iSoftStone 
 All tasks are crowdsourced at iSoftStone. And there are often tasks available for international candidates. Check their hiring page frequently to see available opportunities in your country. 
 International Work From Home Jobs 
 Remember, just because a company is on this list doesn't mean they absolutely hire in your country. The companies found here are known to hire internationally, that is you don't necessarily have to be a U.S. resident to find work. Be sure to double-check whether or not they are hiring where you live. 
 But, if you've been looking for international work from home jobs and worldwide ways to earn money online, these companies should give you a head start in your search.
