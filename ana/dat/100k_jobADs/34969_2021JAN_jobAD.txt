 Digital McKinsey brings together the best of McKinseyâ€™s digital capabilities. 
 Role overview 
 **  The Role: ** 
 Youâ€™ll work with Digital McKinsey in our London office. Digital McKinsey brings together the best of McKinseyâ€™s digital capabilities to help our clients use digital technology to transform their businesses. 
 As part of this group, youâ€™ll join a global team working on everything from IT modernization and strategy to agile, cloud, cybersecurity, and digital transformation. Youâ€™ll typically work on projects across all industries and functions and will be fully integrated with the rest of our global firm. 
 Youâ€™ll also work with colleagues from across McKinsey & Company to help our clients deliver breakthrough products, experiences, and businesses, both on technology and non-technology topics. 
 Our office culture is casual, fun and social, with an emphasis on education and innovation. We have the freedom to try new ideas, experiment and are expected to be constantly learning and growing. There is also a strong emphasis on mentoring others in the group, enabling them to grow and learn. 
 **  What will you be doing? ** 
 In teams, you will contribute to the architecture across the technology stack, from database to native apps. You will create rapid prototypes, usually in 2 to 3 weeks, as well as full-scale applications (typically within 2 to 3 months), by working collaboratively and iteratively through design and development to deliver fully function web-based and mobile applications that meet business goals. 
 Our development teams are small, flexible and employ agile methodologies to quickly provide our consultants with the solutions they need. We combine the latest open source technologies together with traditional Enterprise software products. 
 **  What you need: ** 
 
 Passionate about technology and excited about the impact of emerging/disruptive technologies 
 5+ years of programming experience in at least 2 modern programming languages/ frameworks, such as Node.JS, Go Lang, Elixir, C, C++ or Python 
 Experience working with HTML/ CSS and a modern frontend JavaScript framework, such as ReactJS, AngularJS, EmberJS or Vue.js 
 Writing and utilizing RESTful API services and performance tuning large scale applications 
 Experience with cloud providers (e.g. AWS, Azure, GCP), containerisation (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes) and modern architecture patterns (e.g. microservices, reactive architectures, event-driven architectures) 
 Experience with relational and non-relational data stores (e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB, Cassandra) 
 Playing an active role in the technology community, ie., contributing to open source projects, speaking at conferences, blogging, etc 
 First-hand experience with Agile development methodologies 
 Ability to interact with people at all levels in an organisation 
 Willing to travel up 50-75% of the time across to clients' sites
