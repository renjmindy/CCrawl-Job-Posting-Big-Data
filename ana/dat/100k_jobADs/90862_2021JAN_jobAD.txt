 Called To Do Something…

 Happy are they who observe what is right 
and who do what is just. 
 Psalm 106:3 
 Events in reaction to George Floyd's death inspired a friend to adjust her career path in an attempt to bring about meaningful change. She wrestled with the notion because she will travel into seemingly unknown territory in the process. In the end, she embraced this opportunity because it will allow her to serve others in a hopefully significant way. 
 I can certainly relate to my friend's initial ambivalence. I think we all can. I also share the notion that we're meant to serve others in this life as best we can. God's generous gift of free will and God's absolute faith in our choices allow us to choose just how to go about these things. Nonetheless, we sometimes delay because we aren't sure that we will make a difference after all… 
 When we spoke again, my friend bubbled with enthusiasm regarding her new position. The potential for her to contribute to meaningful change is far greater than she dared to hope. Her work with children will allow her to plant seeds which will grow into something much stronger than the ills which contributed to George Floyd's death. With that, I prayed,  Dear God, help those seeds to blossom into something amazing!  After offering my silent prayer for my friend, I wondered what I will do to bring about meaningful change… 
 Loving God, be with all of those who are working to make this world a better place. Give each of us the courage to follow our hearts ' call to do good.

 Change The World, One Act at a Time

 “Go home to your family and tell them 
how much God has done for you.” 
 From Mark 5:19 
 While growing up, I had visions of grandeur regarding what I would do with my life. I wanted to solve the problems of the world. I wanted to end wars. I wanted to fight against prejudice and injustice. I wanted to end poverty. I wanted to work with special needs children. I wanted to teach. I wanted to become a nun. I wanted to become a nurse… 
 When things began to fall into place, the path before me became a little straighter. I learned to value the seemingly mundane vocations that in reality make all of the difference in the world. I learned to value the seemingly small acts which touch others in profound ways. A good person who deals fairly and kindly with those around her brings peace to our world. Generous couples who allow their love to spill over onto to those around them bring love to the world. Parents who nurture their children with their time and attention bring hope to this world. Caring for those we have been given to love is the most important work we can do. Whether that caring involves small gestures and great sacrifice, it truly changes the world. 
 Dear God, sometimes I wonder if I 'm doing my loved ones or this world any good. Thank You for the precious moments with them which dispel my doubt.

 Though it's taken me a lifetime, I finally get it!

 Be Joyful… It's Okay!

 God fills your lifetime with good; 
your youth is renewed like the eagle's." 
 Psalm 103:5 
 A friend of mine hopes to change careers in order to move on to something which will bring her joy. She wrestles with this notion because it seems selfish to her to want to do something which makes her happy. Though this new opportunity will allow her to serve others in a truly significant way, my friend struggles. 
 I find that I relate far too well to this dilemma. I share the notion that we're meant to serve others in this life regardless of how happy or unhappy it makes us. Like my friend, I fail to fully appreciate God's generous gift of free will and God's absolute faith in our choices. Indeed, it is because of these things that God sends us out on our own. 
 When we spoke, I encouraged my friend to heed her heart's longing. The happiest people I know do the things which bring them joy. In the process, they also bring joy to those around them. As I spoke to my friend, I listened carefully to what I said. Apparently, it is time for me to heed my heart's longing as well. 
 Loving God, you know the longings of our hearts long before we can speak them. Help us to love ourselves as you love us. Give us the courage to hear our deepest cries for joy and to fulfill them as only we can.
