  How To Change Jobs With Little To No Experience  
 Work It Daily 
 July 19, 2014 
 It's not easy to transition into another industry, but the process isn't complicated. If you're wondering how to change jobs with little to no experience, then read on.  Related:   8 Steps To Changing Jobs With A Current Employer  When you're applying for a job in a new industry, putting information from another job that is unrelated is going to raise a red flag for any potential employer. They're going to ask why you were in the other job for so long instead of switching to this industry earlier. If you're younger, it's easier to pull off, but the question may still come up. With that thought in mind, there's not always a way to craft your resume that will get you hired for the job you want. You can still convince them to hire you, but it won't be solely because of your resume. You have to strategize on a higher level. Make sure the resume isn't the main focus of your pitch, especially online. People should come across other stories and documents about you first to give you the best shot at getting the job or being seriously considered. If they see your resume first, they'll probably disqualify you pretty quickly. They don't know your personality or aptitude, which are the qualifications you can utilize regardless of your level of experience. (On your resume, lead with your degree if it's relevant and the experience you have, including anything that could be related to your new field. It may not be your top priority in this situation, but neglecting it would also be a poor choice.) Leverage the relevant skills you have to meet people and tell a great story about your past. If you frame your experience in terms of what the employer wants, it will be much easier to prove you're a fit for the job (and the company in general). The example in the video above is a bartender trying to become a marketer. Customer service can be an important element of both of those roles, depending on the exact responsibilities. In terms of your starting position, you'll begin at least one step lower than where you would have been if you were working in the industry all along, but if the potential employer knows you're okay with that, it shouldn't be an issue. There are so many people that think certain jobs or tasks are beneath them, and that can quickly turn employers off. Stressing that you understand and are open to those possibilities will make it easier on the hiring manager to choose you. Showing your personality really can't happen in a resume or cover letter, which is why it's so important to find ways to meet people at the company. Lead with your story, not your resume. Meet people at the company at the level you're applying for and above too. If you can exhibit your personality and aptitude through those channels, you just may land the job.
