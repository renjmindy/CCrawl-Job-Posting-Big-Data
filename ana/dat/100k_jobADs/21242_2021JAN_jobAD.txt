 Fix a bug on a custom Wordpress Theme 
 Published: Last month  Project duration: 3 - 4 months Bids: 13 
 I need a freelancer who is available to work on demand. 
 The website is a custom built Learning Management System for Wordpress that attends different schools. The system itself has a few custom post types and the user can access the course if he has an active subscription on WooCommerce. 
 We have encountered a bug where WooCommerce isn't deactivating the user account and users with expired subscriptions are still gaining access to the course. 
 We have developed a custom code to enable and disable the access to the course and a backend page where the Admin can see the list of active students. All of this touchpoints and codes must be revised and tested to ensure that only active subscriptions or users within their payment period can access the student area. 
 This would be the first task, there are more tasks and improvements that needs done.
