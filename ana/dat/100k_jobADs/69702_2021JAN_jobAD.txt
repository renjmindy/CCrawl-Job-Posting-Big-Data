 Obama manipulates unemployment numbers. 
 By  Obamarageous  on October 18, 2012 |  2 Comments 
 So, we were told that the unemployment rate had fallen to 7.8% in September 2012 after 43 consecutive months of unemployment at 8% or higher. And this was after Obama promised that unemployment wouldn't reach 8% if his stimulus plan was rushed through Congress. 
 The reported drop to 7.8% unemployment was touted as a great victory by Obama, and was used in his campaign and in the presidential debates on domestic policy. 
 TWO DAYS after the second presidential debate- the LAST presidential debate before the November election in which domestic policy would be discussed (since the third presidential debate will focus solely on foreign policy)- it's revealed that the reason for the reported drop to 7.8% unemployment was that  "Last week, California reported a large drop in applications, pushing down the overall figure to the lowest since February 2008. This week, it reported a significant increase as it processed applications delayed from the previous week."  So, the 7.8% unemployment rate for September 2012 was a false report. Kudos to California for its grandiose effort to get Obama re-elected! 
 Moreover,  at least two economists at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) have contributed to President Barack Obamaâ€™s campaign.  You sure can trust those numbers the Obama Administration puts out there! ( sarcasm )
