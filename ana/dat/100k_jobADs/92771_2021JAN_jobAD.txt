 Rosie's Book Review Team #RBRT James Bone and The Italian Job by @FBellAuthor

 Today's team review comes from Alison, she blogs at  alisonwilliamswriting.wordpress.com 
 
 Alison has been reading children's book James Bone and the Italian Job by Frank Bell 
 ‘James Bone and the Italian Job’ by Frank Bell 
 The queen’s been kidnapped and there’s only one dog that can save the day - James Bone of CI6 (that’s Canine Intelligence, of course!). 
 This adventure for children is introduced by Winston, a Very British Bulldog who lives at 11 Downing Street with the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He hears the story from Humphrey, the Downing Street cat, who is the first animal to learn of the kidnapping. Humphrey goes straight to James Bone and the race to save the queen is on. 
 With a host of human and animal characters, including Sherlock Holmes and a Mafia Don, this is an exciting and entertaining read. It’s well-paced and has enough going on to keep the most demanding reader happy. 
 Some young readers, however, might need to ask Mum or Dad who a few of the characters are based on and I’m not sure that they will understand all the James Bond references. So be prepared for plenty of questions! 
 Four out of five stars

 James Bone and The Italian Job  by  Frank Bell 
 My rating:  4 of 5 stars 
 James Bone and the Italian Job is a children's book most suitable for junior school children around the ages of 8 - 11 years old. James Bone and his friends are all animals. It opens with an introduction from Winston, a British Bulldog who lives with the Chancellor of the Exchequer at Number 11 Downing Street, London. He tells us about one of the adventures of secret agent 007 James Bone. 
 Humphrey is the Downing Street cat and he is the first to hear about the kidnapping of the Queen on a particularly fine day in May. He rushed to inform his good friend James Bone. James works for CI6 (Canine Intelligence) and is soon summoned to headquarters and given the responsibility of finding the Queen. 
 At Buckingham Palace James questions the palace animals and receives useful information from Henrietta mouse, who saw a suspicious bundle being taken away by a Pizza delivery company. 
 With the help of Sherlock Holmes they believe the Mafia have taken the Queen and a daring rescue mission is organised. 
 This is a fun read and if children know the famous characters who are mirrored in this book they should really enjoy the storyline. 
 I received a copy for review from Frank Bell’s PR agency,  SRF Integrated Communications Ltd .

 Good Deeds Challenge Year 2, Week 52 
 Posted on  April 19, 2015  by   Rosie Amber 
 28 
 This will be my last Good Deeds post, I've completed a 2 year challenge, enough to make Good Deeds a regular part of my day for the rest of my life. 
 Welcome to my second Year of Good Deeds, a challenge I set myself during April 2013. I decided to do at least one Good Deed a day for a whole year, now I almost finished my second year. 
 This week I’ve been doing the following; 
 April 12th - Had a big afternoon setting my Mum up with spreadsheets and a Facebook account. Am reading  Fallen On Good Times by Rewan Tremethick. 
 April 13th - It's still the school holidays so no volunteering at school this morning, had a lunchtime walk and picked up litter instead. Washed loads of crockery and chinaware ready to take to the charity shop. 
 April 14th - We are into the third week of the A to Z Challenge, made a big effort to visit lots of bloggers today and give my support. 
 April 15th - Delivered 3 boxes of items to the charity shop. Read  Going Through The Change by Samantha Bryant 
 April 16th - Picked up loads of litter on a morning walk. Today I'm reading  Cupids' Way by Joanne Phillips. 
 April 17th - We have friends coming over this afternoon, so I've baked a cake and nagged the kids to help with housework. In fact while I nipped into town and pocked up litter on the way home, they'd cleaned and tidied the lounge. Am reading  Catching Cassidy by Melissa Foster , book one in a new NA series. 
 April 18th - My friend asked me to help out with a book review and I read  James Bone and the Italian Job by Frank Bell  a children's book about secret agent animals. Began reading  The Family Trap by Joanne Phillips  last evening. 
 This is it, my final post to end my challenge, which began two years ago as a two week test to see it I could take up the challenge, then it moved to a year and then two years. It's been an amazing experience and opened my eyes to wonderful everyday opportunities to make my world a better place to live in and to send out ripples into the lives of others who touch mine with friendship or as strangers.
