 We are looking for someone to join our wonderful company - ImpactSense. Our mission is to help companies better understand their customers like never before. If we achieve this, it means we will globally improve customer satisfaction making the world a happier place :) Ok, maybe that is a bit too much, but we do have big ambitions. 
 We offer a disruptive customer experience insight platform and a range of insight-led products. We are looking for someone to help with project delivery and to lend a hand in marketing as and when needed. Ideally, you have a specialism or background in research and insight. With this background, you should have an understanding of the principles around research techniques and how to conduct interviews. 
 Equally, we'd need you to be hyper organised with great attention to detail and super smart with a great grasp of written and oral communication. As part of your interview, we will ask you to complete a skills assessment to see how well you fit the role. 
 Example activities within this role: 
 
 Scheduling interviews 
 Using our platforms to recruit customers 
 Help writing research briefs and surveys 
 Analysing quantitative and qualitative data into reports 
 Writing content, news and marketing articles 
 Management of the website 
 
 We will of course provide training on all aspects of your role. 
 We are looking to hire asap, so send your CVs and a bit about you. We are London based but you'll initially work remotely with regular daily catch-ups. But in the future, we expect to be working together in a central London office with you present :) 
 The salary for this role is between £17,100 and £18,200. 
 We look forward to receiving your CV.
