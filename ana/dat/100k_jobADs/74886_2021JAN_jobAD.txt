  4 Tips For Overcoming Career Fear  
 Lisa Adams 
 July 11, 2013 
 Are you paralyzed in fear over your current or future career? Or are you in the middle of a  job search  and it just isn’t getting you anywhere? Which FEAR is holding you back? We all have them. Here are my three tips for overcoming  career fear : 
 
 1. Name It 
 Name the fear. Here’s a list of the few I have seen or experienced myself. 
 
 Rejection 
 Failure 
 Heartache 
 Missed expectations 
 Missed opportunities 
 The what ifs 
 Change (new town, travel, long commute, new boss) 
 
 2. Face The Fear 
 Everyone who has done something worthwhile or unique has been afraid much of the time. Every time I get to speak to an organization, my stomach goes in knots. But then I can tell the butterflies to line up, say that I can do this, I was meant for this, and then walk on stage. When I am done, I love it. I love helping professionals with their career and job search.  Facing the fear  that I’ll  tank it  becomes small compared to how I can help others. 
 3. Take Action 
 Action diminishes fear. Action can entail several things when it comes to career. The first should be determine your direction. Where do you want to go? What do you want to do? Then make a plan around that target. If this is overwhelming for you, don’t go it alone. Work with a coach or trusted advisor to help get you started. 
 4. Control The Controllables 
 Sometimes you have to say, “I have done all I can so far with this opportunity.” When you get to that place of hitting a wall; they don’t call back after several attempts, and so on, shift your eyes on creating more opportunities. Don’t let the uncontrollables control you. When I whine about the weather or get angry about the situation I am in, I ask myself, what can I do to make this better? What can I control and what can’t I? If you can’t control it - ignore it and move on. Take these tips and don’t let fear hold you back. There is always hope. Photo Credit:  Shutterstock
