 Hazards of the Job 
 July 14, 2017  by  wordsfromanneli   36 Comments 
 My phone has been cutting out in the middle of conversations. Today the phone man was coming to check it out. I remembered then that the yew tree we had planted to hide the phone wiring box had become rather overgrown and the poor phone man would need a machete to get in there. The picture below was taken AFTER I did a fast trimming job on the yew. It's still about a foot higher than it should be. 
 But behind it, on the wall, you can see the phone connection box,and a surprise! 
 Just look at all the work some poor bird did to make a nest. So many trips carrying mouthfuls of leaves, grass, twigs, and soil. The location was perfect. Hidden, out of direct sun and wind, and up off the ground, this nest was safe and dry. I have no idea what kind of bird nested here, but it had to be something smaller than a robin. 
 
 If you look carefully at the bottom of the phone box just under the black wire, you will see why I could never be a phone repair person. I'm glad I didn't see this eight-legged fellow, even though he's dead and dried out, until after I had done the trimming of the yew tree. 
 Having to push your way to a phone box, through all kinds of brush and dead critters, is just one of the hazards of the job. My phone repairman was good about having to fight a few cobwebs today. Very brave of him to come out still smiling.

 What a good looking yew tree. You and the phone man were brave, Anneli üòÄ After Siri and Selma made such good friends with spiders and now master Spiderish, I find spiders quite interesting. Did you know that there are some 380000 (!).sorts of spiders and that spiders eat more insects than birds and bats combined. üôÇ 
That's a tiny little nest, I wonder if someone can find out which birds it belongs to. Is this possible? To determine a bird by an empty nest? Wonder what an empty house will give away concerning the previous owner. üôÇ 
Have a wonderful weekend. x

 380,000 types? That's too many single spiders, never mind types! And yes, they eat a lot of bugs, but what will eat the spiders? As for the nest, yes, I'm sure there are people who know what kind of bird makes this type of nest. It would be interesting to know. And the empty houses that people leave behind? Well, I always thought that would make a great story. There are many abandoned homes in Montana and I often wonder what drove the people away. It's a harsh climate and hard life even though the state is very beautiful. Many a good book could be written about those empty homes. Thanks for your comments and ideas, Dina. Enjoy your weekend.

 Yes, you are right. Empty houses left behind would make a good story. I suppose many of them are occupied by ghosts now. And the spook when spoken too. üëª

 Yikes! That's a big spider! I'm not sure I could do his job or the job of an exterminator.

 He's all curled up but if he were uncurled he'd be a good size.

 I bet they have! They always have to visit the most creepy crawly places to find the boxes and wires and that's where the spiders hang out. Shudders!

 I save spiders and deposit outside into a safe shrub. Now, a snake..another story. The Momma bird may have returned to that phone box more than once to deliver the kids.

 She probably nested there so she could quickly call 911 for the doctor when the babies came.

 Bird's nest, yeay. One is lucky to have that in the garden though the bird chose an unlikely spot.

 One year a robin built a nest on top of a hoe I had hung up on the side of the house with the rest of my garden tools.

 A great story and good that the birds and nest are okay. I have a similar nest of a tiny bird, perhaps a sparrow. Spiders can be pretty scary. Yours doesn't look too awful. Oh, I have seen worse. It's a great story I tell at school.

 Yes, I have seen worse too, but somehow seeing the shriveled up body of a spider is enough to bring back all those other traumatic moments.

 We have a few bats here, just little ones, and when I take the dogs out for a last pee at night, if the bats are flying around in the backyard, I turn my collar up and hold it closed tightly at my throat. Too many vampire movies, I guess.

 So much work, especially when you consider the high mortality rate. Every bird that survives is a miracle.

 It's amazing in what funny places birds build their nests sometimes. A few years ago I found a nest in one of the flower pots. I had to be very careful with the watering. The year after there was a nest in the same pot again. I hate spiders but if I find one in the house I put it outside (using a thick towel).

 OMG! When I imagine you using a towel to put the spider outside, I can see it running up my arm! Also, I could never use that towel again without imagining that spider on it.(Okay, I admit I've got it bad!)

 I hope the nest is safe and eggs, if any, are also safe. I never bothered about creepy crawlies, but I am now terrified of them. Living in areas where I don't see many creepies has turned me into a coward üôÇ

 Still waiting for the phone to be fixed. Turns out the problem is not with my phone or phone line, but rather a neighbourhood problem. A line somewhere in our neighbourhood has been compromised. Takes them a while to find it.

 Birds nest in funny places. Just yesterday my husband, who manages a state fish hatchery where we live, came home with a picture of a crowder's motor that burned up, because when the worker started the engine, he didn't know there was an old bird's nest in it! Some crazy things happen here for sure! 
 Your home is lovely, and that is good that the repair man was so gracious. Also, that spider is nothing compared to some of the ones I see here on a daily basis! In fact, my son has a "pet" black widow named Ava that he caught a really long time ago and catches bugs to feed her. However, he moved out a couple of weeks ago and didn't take her with him‚Ä¶.I AM NOT feeding her‚Ä¶.so he is going to have to take her or let her go at some point! Fortunately, they can go a long time between feedings. üôÇ

 I think I'll just stay living right here. The spiders we have are quite enough for me. Thanks for sharing your spider and bird's nest stories.

 You're welcome. I've had to kill a few rattlesnakes in the yard over the years, too! But haven't seen any in several years now.

 I don't mind snakes, although I worry about the dogs when we're in Montana, and I wouldn't want to be nipped by a rattler myself. But it's arachnids of all sorts that put the run on me. Guess you've figured that out by now. üòâ

 Yeah, getting rid of rattlers was something I had to learn to do since when we moved here in Jan. 2001, our kids were only 2 and 4!! I usually only get freaked out by wolf spiders if I see any in the house. Those‚Ä¶I kill!

 I like spiders since they eat other bugs, ants and flies. üï∑ üï∏ 
I am proud of how you whacked away at this lovely yew tree, Anneli. The bird's nest was a little sad, but maybe the bird had its eggs, they hatched and flew far away (?) üòä
