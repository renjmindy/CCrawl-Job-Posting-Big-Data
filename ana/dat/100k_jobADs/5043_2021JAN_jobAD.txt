 Distributed smart energy technology. 
 Role overview 
 Role overview 
 Moixa is a clean energy company. We build our own batteries and aggregate them and other third party energy storage devices (batteries, Electric Vehicles...) to optimise their aggregated behaviour and maximise savings for the end customer. In doing so we act as a virtual power plant that provides the flexibility that the Grid needs in order to maximise the usage of renewable energy and to unlock mass adoption of EV technology. 
 Our mission is to manage the world's batteries. 
 The role 
 You will be joining a small, focused and collaborative team of talented developers that act autonomously to provide the features that the company needs to succeed in its mission. Those include any subset of: 
 - Solving complex optimisation problems, using machine learning and other often bespoke algorithms. 
 - Building the required platform infrastructure to ingest and process big streams of data in real time, using AWS primitives. 
 - Designing and implementing the business logic to expose our functionality via APIs and UI interfaces, using functional programming and serverless computing. 
 - Developing the firmware for our hardware devices including optimisation on the edge and integrations with third party energy storage devices, using embedded Linux and Rust. 
 You will be encouraged to work and grow your knowledge on multiple parts of the stack according to your personal interests and abilities. Our team has a strong tradition of using functional programming and type systems to build pragmatic and flexible systems to satisfy business requirements. 
 We are committed to equality and to paying equitably for equal work. 
 You should be 
 - Happy working in a small, fast moving team, in which your individual initiative and contributions can have a big impact. 
 - Motivated and enthusiastic, open to learn new things. 
 - Self-starter, managing own workload and deadlines. 
 Required skills 
 - Functional programming experience in at least two strongly typed languages. 
 - Unix operating systems 
 Advantages 
 - Experience in any of: Typescript/Haskell/Rust. 
 - Interest in the energy sector or IoT. 
 - Familiarity with AWS tools. 
 - Familiarity with frontend frameworks such as React/ReasonML/Reflex/Elm.
