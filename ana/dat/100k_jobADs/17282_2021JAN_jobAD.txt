 Less than USD 10 / hour 
 Hacking hr is a global learning community of hr leaders and practitioners. We get together to discuss, collaborate, learn about all things at the intersection of future of work, technology, organizations, people, transformation, innovation and the impact on Human Resources. 
 We are looking for someone to take over the work of managing our content and social media strategy. This will include our social media networks: Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, newsletter, podcast among others. 
 We are looking for someone who has the appetite to grow with us. Some of the responsibilities include: 
 1. Design, assess, collect data, evaluate and adjust the social media and content strategy 
2. 
 Create and/or use pre-existing content to post in the social media networks. 
3. Leverage on data analytics to make timely decisions about the data. 
 This is a full time job that will require extreme hands-on approach. We are NOT looking for someone to post what we think needs to be posted. We are looking for someone to design and implement the strategy, to be actively growing our social media presence, and to tell us how to run this social media show, and not the other way around. 
 We like people who don't have all the experience and expertise we require, because we like to grow together with them.  But you'll have to be incredibly driven, committed, hungry for learning and growth, willing to learn from and with us, and add a LOT of creativity and innovation to the work. 
 We have the most amazing metrics of success and we are inspired to grow the Hacking HR community like never before... We need someone to help us out. Is that you? 
 Note: you have to be fluent in English.
