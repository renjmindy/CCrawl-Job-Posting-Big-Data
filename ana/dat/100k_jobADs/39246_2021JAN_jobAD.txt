 Forbes Top Ten List For Best Places To Buy A Home Include Two Pennsylvania Metro Areas 
 Forbes.com has come up with a list of the best places in the United States to buy a home. The list is based on home affordability, unemployment, foreclosure rates and year-to-year housing price trends. 
 Two Pennsylvania metropolitan areas made the list.  Pittsburgh PA  (2,356,285 - 2010 census) was ranked number 2 and  Lancaster PA  (519,445 - 2010 census) was number 8. 
 Earlier this year Zillow.com ranked Pittsburgh as number 4 and Lancaster as number 7 on their list. 
 The median sale price for a home in Pittsburgh is $103,000 and Lancaster is $154,900. 
 Both Pittsburgh and Lancaster have a comparably low unemployment rate and cost of living.
