 About this project 
 it-programming / others-5 
 USD 250 - 500 
 We have an web application that is hosted in AWS (North Virginia/USA) serving customers worldwide. Some of these customers are in China and they are having performance issues to access the application. We have CloudFront service up and running and no other country so far is experiencing performance issues. 
Once China´s internet has some peculiarities, we believe we haven´t executed correctly the CloudFront configuration in China and we are looking for support to make it happen. 
Preferabily: 
 
 someone located in China 
- able to speak Mandarim and English 
- With AWS technical skills 
- Some experience with Cloudfront setup for sites not located in China, but authorized to be accessed from inside the country.
