 Meet Me Today? 
 Yesterday was the first of a 2-day  CWC Fremont Branch's Holiday Book Fair . Today we will continue to meet readers and other writers between 1-4pm, at the Union City Public Library, 34007 Alvarado-Niles Road. 
 
 Fremont CWC Holiday Book Fair 
 It was a lot of fun to meet friends, readers, people who follow my blog. Best-selling author,  Ellen Sussman , made an appearance and addressed the gathering. I met  Charlotte Cook , from Komenar Publishing, and my friend  Karin Ireland , author of  The Job Survival Instruction Book  and many others. 
 I also met  Geraldine Solon , author of a series of succesful romance novels including  Chocolicious  and Love Letters. Geraldine organized the Book Fair - so thank you, Geraldine for all your hard work. 
 
 Chocolocious - Geraldine Solon
