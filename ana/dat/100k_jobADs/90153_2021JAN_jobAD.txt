  #1 Trick For Exceeding Your Wildest Career Goals  
 Ryan Niessen 
 May 18, 2015 
 Recently, I’ve become more and more interested in pursuing what Tai Lopez calls  “The Good Life.”  It means having health, wealth, love, and happiness… which are really the four big things everyone’s after.  Related:   #1 Secret To More Health, Wealth, Love, And Happiness  What really caught my attention is Tai’s thoughts on “impatient patience” and how to go about setting goals, and then meeting or exceeding them. See  most people’s perspective on goal setting and achieving big things is totally backwards.  It’s not our fault - it’s just how we’ve been trained... and it’s one of those funny cases where once you hear it… it just clicks. Once you understand this, it can change your entire future. So, in the article, I’m going to tell you  Tai’s secret to meeting and exceeding your wildest career goals , and give you a few resources for getting to the next level. 
 
 “Impatient Patience” Vs. “Patient Impatience” 
 According to Tai, the vast majority of people act as if they have all the time in the world to achieve their goals. They’re patiently waiting for things to come together, or fall into place for them. However, as soon as they see an opportunity come up, they jump in as quickly as possible and throw all caution to the wind. If you’re like me, you can identify at least a few instances in your life when this has been the case. That means that you know - just like I do - that this approach doesn’t end well, and  doesn’t provide the results we were seeking.  The reason why is because this is living in a state of what Tai calls “impatient patience”. The key is to flip it around, and be  “Patiently Impatient.”

 How To Be “Patiently Impatient” 
 Here’s where things really clicked for me: 
 
 “Freak out if you’re not getting the dreams that you wish you had. Don’t even say, “tomorrow I’m going to get good at this”... freak out now, but then patiently build your dream.”  - Tai Lopez 
 
 It’s like Will Smith says: 
 
 "You don't set out to build a wall. You don't say 'I'm going to build the biggest, baddest, greatest wall that's ever been built.' You don't start there. You say, 'I'm going to lay this brick as perfectly as a brick can be laid. You do that every single day. And soon you have a wall." 
 
 Getting inspired, motivated, and starting to take action TODAY, and then patiently building your dream, brick by brick, is how you can be “patiently impatient." … And it’s how you can meet and exceed your wildest dreams. 
 The Ideal Length Of Time To Set Goals 
 Another problem many people have with this approach is that they set 10 year goals. However, Tai says that this only serves to give you an excuse to wait until year eight before taking any action. Instead,  set 18 month goals.  This gives you enough time to make it happen, while still encouraging you to take action today.
