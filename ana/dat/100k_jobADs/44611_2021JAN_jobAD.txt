 Posted on  January 19, 2010  by  andrewleigh

 In an exciting new development, the Australian National University has announced the establishment of a Research School of Economics (RSE) commencing on January 1, 2010.

The RSE will integrate the School of Economics in the College of Business and Economics the Centre for Applied Macroeconomic Analysis and the Economics Program in the Research School of Social Sciences. 
 This integration creates exciting new opportunities for economics at the ANU and will improve the research, education and policy outreach capabilities of the ANU in respect of economics. The RSE's focus is on conducting leading-edge research, providing research-led education and offering expertise to inform the economic policy debate. The new RSE covers the full spectrum of research areas in economics, econometrics and economic history. This includes applied economics and economic theory.
