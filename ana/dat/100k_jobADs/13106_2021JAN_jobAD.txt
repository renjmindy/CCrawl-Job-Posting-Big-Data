 Those little jobs 
 Posted on  May 13, 2012  by  Helen 
 Now that the weather has at last shown signs of a return to spring, the weeds have been multiplying in abundance. Part of today has therefore been spent pulling them up by hand. As ever, the dandelions will require slightly more brutal handling but I couldn't face more of them at the moment. 
 More positively, the vegetables are also shooting away, so I was pleased to be able to tie more of the broad bean and mangetout plants to their stakes. The new beetroot I planted the other day is starting to appear (thank goodness it is not the seeds that are too old), as have the spring onions. More and more of the apple tree blossom is coming out, and the strawberries are well on their way. It would be nice this year if I could get a crop early in the summer. 
 In fact, I am impatient for this year's crops all round. I'm trying to hold off picking anymore rhubarb just yet as I want to give the plant chance to settle into the ground I put it in last autumn. Prior to that it had been in a pot until I knew where I wanted to have it in the garden. At least I've still got two of last year's purple sprouting broccoli on the production line, so I think the latest florets are destined for tomorrow's evening meal. 
 Today, I even used some of the rainwater I've been collecting over the last few weeks. That was so satisfying at the same time as being a little sad, as it certainly goes down a lot more quickly than it takes to collect it. Yet the pots really do need to be kept watered, since they dry out so quickly. So, let's hope for timely rain - at night. 
 Lo and behold, since writing the above last night, I have woken up to find that my wish has been granted. It rained. And now the sun is out again. Happy gardening, everyone!

 About Helen 
 I have always been interesting in living a more environmentally friendly lifestyle and used to do what I could. Now, I have come to realise that we have reached such a point in terms of environmental degradation that it is more important - perhaps - to focus on building resilience. I therefore do as much as I can to reuse, grow my own and encourage a supportive community, for example. I also keep reading and learning all the time.
