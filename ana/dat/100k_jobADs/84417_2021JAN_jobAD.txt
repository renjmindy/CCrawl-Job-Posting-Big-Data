 Sales Job Offer Letter template 
 The following offer letter template for sales candidates contains placeholders where you can fill in your company’s data. Feel free to tweak the tone and modify employment terms. 
 
 Keep in mind that this template is not a legal document and may not take into account all relevant local or national laws. Please ask your attorney or HR to review your finalized job offer letter. 
 Tips on how to modify this sales job offer letter template 
 The sales industry is notorious for its  high turnover . When modifying this template, make sure your job offers compel your best candidates to not only accept, but stay with your company. Here are a few ways to create more attractive sales job offers: 
 Create clear compensation plans with attainable goals.  Compensation packages for salespeople often include performance-based commission or standard bonuses (when the entire sales team achieves quotas, or when the entire company achieves its goals.) Offer letters to candidates for sales positions should clearly describe any: 
 
 Base salary 
 Commission structure 
 Bonuses 
 Sales metrics (e.g. quotas) 
 
 Incentivize overachievement.  Motivate potential sales hires to go beyond targets by offering incentives when they outperform their established goals. Mention any accelerated commissions sales representatives might be entitled to if they close X amount over quota, or  sales contests  you host teamwide. 
 Sell yourself.  Salespeople need to be able to sell your product, so make sure to highlight how sellable your product or service is. Here’s how: 
 
 Mention your various sales teams (e.g. account management, account executives) or number of sales employees. (e.g. “You’ll be joining an X-person team”) 
 Highlight your mission (e.g. “We are delighted to offer you the X position, where we aim to [insert mission statement]”) 
 List any other unique qualities about your company or team. For example:
 
 Diversity 
 Mentorship opportunities 
 Potential for promotion and growth 
 
 
 
 Note that your offer letter should echo what you’ve already discussed with candidates during the hiring process (e.g. working schedule, shifts and travel expense reimbursements.) Also, to make sure your job offer is attractive, mention any employee perks and benefits you offer. 
 Here’s a sample sales job offer email template to introduce your formal job offer letter:
