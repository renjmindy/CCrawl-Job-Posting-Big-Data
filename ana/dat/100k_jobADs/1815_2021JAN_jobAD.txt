 Job fairs: Opportunities for companies 
 by  admin  | 20. April 2017 |  Stand Construction 
 The supply of qualified workers is declining noticeably due to demographic developments. The approximately 200 recruiting and job fairs in Germany are becoming more and more popular for companies. Here, employers have the opportunity to present themselves attractively. Talks between employers and potential employees take place in a more informal atmosphere than in a scheduled job interview. The successful presentation of your own exhibition stand on site plays an important role when it comes to convincing suitable applicants to work for your company. 
 Scoring points with interaction possibilities and trade fair design 
 Finding the right employees is an important success factor for companies. To be able to take advantage of job fairs, your stand should also score points in terms of design. Your stand will appeal to interested trade fair visitors if it matches your services and products and puts them in an appealing light. 
 Interaction possibilities in particular increase the attention of trade fair visitors. Individual stand gifts, such as free snacks, drinks, pens or office supplies - provided with your own logo and contact details - attract trade fair visitors. A separate area where an interview can be conducted in peace is also an important aspect. 
 Perhaps you can also offer CV checks in the run-up to the fair or the possibility of short interviews with potential candidates? 
 Inspiring at job fairs in a personal interview 
 Especially for small and medium-sized companies looking for new staff, an optimal presentation with their own exhibition stand is interesting. At regional job fairs, there are usually many job seekers who are familiar with the region. 
 When looking after the stand, care should be taken to ensure that trained personnel, HR decision-makers and long-standing employees are able to convince through a targeted approach with insider knowledge. In particular, questions from interested visitors regarding current job advertisements, possible internships, employment contracts as a student trainee or scientific theses in cooperation with companies should be clarified in advance of the trade fair stand support and answered directly. 
 However, attention should also be paid to external aspects. The recognition of your company can be supported by uniform clothing for the trade fair staff. 
 Inspire trade fair visitors with information on special offers from your company. For example, if you make the diversity of your employees an integral part of your personnel strategy through a so-called diversity management concept. 
 Successful trade fair stand strengthens employer branding 
 A successful strategy, tailor-made marketing instruments and sufficient trade fair advertising material are also required for an individual stand design that will be remembered.
