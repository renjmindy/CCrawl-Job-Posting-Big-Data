 Your opportunities in Hessen 
 Hessen’s craft sector offers qualified training to young people. The duale Ausbildung – a combination of practical training on the job and theory classes at school – is the most popular vocational qualification in Germany. 
 Many of Hessen’s companies need a lot of workers for the years to come. This is mainly the case in the technical and healthcare sectors. 
 Hessen could easily be described as “Germany’s most international economic region”. Hessen’s people are known for their hospitality, and they make it easy for newcomers to make contact with the locals and find their place within the community. 
 We offer skilled workers, university leavers, craftsmen, engineers and employees from almost every sector the chance to work in an exciting and international environment.
