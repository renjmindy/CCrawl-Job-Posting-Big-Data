 HRSA Announces Funding to Support Veteran Careers in Nursing 
 The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announced a new funding opportunity for accredited schools of nursing, health care facilities, or partnerships between the two:  Nurse Education, Practice, Quality and Retention Program (NEPQR) – Veteran’s Bachelor of Science Degree in Nursing (VBSN) . Words for Good® has collaborated with various institutions on the preparation of successful HRSA Bureau of Nursing applications in the past. 
 The grant is aimed at supporting our nation’s veterans in taking the needed steps to become nurses by increasing the enrollment, retention, and graduation of veterans into and from BSN programs. The VBSN program builds on a collaborative effort with the Department of Defense and the Department of Veteran’s Affairs to increase veterans’ employment opportunities by helping to pursue careers in professional nursing - a high-growth, high-demand field. 
 Applicants are expected to propose projects that support veterans in enrolling in, progressing, and obtaining a baccalaureate nursing degree (BSN); supporting successful passage of the NCLEX-RN licensing exam; modifying curricula and services to address the unique needs of veterans; and preparing veterans for the transition from military to the civilian professional nursing practice role at the baccalaureate level. 
 HRSA anticipates awarding a total of $2,800,000 to eight awardees. Awards will be up to $350,000 per year for three years. Submissions are due February 18, 2014.
