 Prayer Request that I will Receive my Right Job and for My Daughter 
 
 Prayer Request that I will Receive my Right Job and for My Daughter 
 Please pray with me that I will receive the job I seek as administrative executive secretary at the lawton fortsill army base or something better. Also for my daughter transportation is in need of bad repair I pray that she will have the funds to get her car fixed as it is her only transport to work a job she needs to keep for she is her only support living several states away from family. Thank you God,thank you prayer warriors. amen Ann Wilkerson
