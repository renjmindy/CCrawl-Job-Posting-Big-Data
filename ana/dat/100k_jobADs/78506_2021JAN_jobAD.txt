 Why we (non-boomers) hate our jobs 
 Only 45 percent of Americans are happy in their jobs , which represents a record low in the surveyors' 20-plus years of surveying Americans on their job satisfaction. 
 While the knee-jerk tendency is to blame such statistics (almost) entirely on monetary issues, my own historical insufficient job satisfaction comes from much more than just monetary issues. 
 I see these factors (not necessarily in any certain order) as contributing significantly to Americans' low job satisfaction: 
 
 Most supervisors at the workplace are baby boomers, and most baby boomers are in it for themselves. They're in their supervisory jobs  not  to make everything better for everyone at the workplace, but to make everything better for  themselves.  They like their big salaries and they like telling others what to do instead of vice-versa; they get off on their power trips. They create toxic workplace environments in which the employees  know  that to complain or criticize, even nicely and professionally, probably will bring boomer retaliation upon them, and yet these very same boomers tell themselves,  even though they have created such environments of fear and intimidation,  that their employees just  wuv  them because  Hey,   their employees never complain or criticize!  Anyway, the boomers' focus isn't to leave the workplace in better shape than they got it, but to leave the workplace with the most that they can suck out of it, such as in their too-high salaries and in their retirement and other benefits. And this shows. Every day. 
 Following the boomers' example, too many non-supervisory workers (and non-boomer supervisors) are in it for themselves, too. "Teamwork" is just a bullshit word that is tossed around the workplace, often used only or primarily in order to strong-arm others into doing things that aren't their responsibility. 
 Workers who live from paycheck to paycheck (or nearly so) see that although they're performing the brunt of the work, it's the clueless (usually baby-boomer) managers who are making all of the dough. Often the overpaid boomers brag about their latest big purchase or their overseas vacation, which does  not  improve the morale of those of us who cannot afford such things. Even the dullest of human beings know unfairness when they experience it, and it's not fair that those who perform the lion's share of the work get only scraps. 
 The boomers  _ won't go the fuck away  -- _you have to pry their cold, dead fingers from their jobs, like you would with a U.S. Supreme Court justice -- and by the time that any of us who are younger than the boomers could ever ascend to a managerial position, out of disgust for the workplace we long would have lost the desire to do so. The  boomers '  parents stepped aside in order to give the  boomers  the reins. But the spoiled-brat boomers refuse to do the same for those who follow them. 
 Way too often, those in supervisory positions got those positions  not  for their  competence,  but for their willingess to shit and piss and to crack the whip upon their underlings, which is what those above them require them to do. (Interestingly, the boomer supervisors usually are being just as exploited by the plutocrats as are we underlings, yet the boomer supervisors seem oblivious to this fact.) 
 In such a highly specialized society, too often the worker does not get to see the benefits of his or her work. He or she  might  actually be doing some very beneficial work, but he or she will never see it. 
 We Generation X'ers (and others) have a highfalutin education that we can't even  use . We are qualified, more than qualified, even, for the higher-level jobs, but those jobs are all taken by the boomers (and were already taken by the boomers when we entered the workplace). Because the plum jobs were claimed long, long ago, we end up doing the shit work. (My fellow Gen X'er  Ted Rall  appopriately has called us X'ers the "overeducated underclass.") Despite all of this, the boomers expect us to be bouncy and giddy at the workplace. The boomers want us to be smart enough to do our jobs and their jobs, too, but to be too stupid to realize that we're being raped in the ass with ground glass as lube. 
 Let's face it: Corporations are in it for the money. (And most of us work for a corporation.) Whatever services or goods the corps provide are just a means of profiteering, and if there's  any  quality in their goods or services at all, that's only the  minimum  quality that they  must  provide in order to get their profits. I left nursing more than a decade ago when it was clear to me that  profits  were --  are  -- waaaaay more important than are  people  in the wealth care -- er,  health  care -- system, and my boyfriend, who is a pharmacist, is clear that he isn't much more than a prostitute for the big pharamaceutical corporations. What used to be  noble professions  are now basically  prostitution gigs.   (Thanks,  boomers, for turning to  shit  everything  that you put your grubbies on.) 
 
 Solutions? Turn the boomers into something that's actually  useful,  such as  Soylent Green , maybe? 
 In any case, it seems that the American workplace won't be worth working at until the boomers have all finally kicked off. But by  then,  will anyone have an iota of workplace morale left? 
 P.S.  I want to share with you  Salon.com blogger Andrew Leonard's  succinct summary of the baby boomers: 
 In the '60s they got all the good drugs, in the '70s all the sex, in the '80s all the money, and now … they won't let go of all the jobs. It's goes without saying that during the next decade they'll gobble up all the good health care. 
 And Social Security, too. 
 The boomers won't even leave us with the  polar ice caps,  for fuck's sake. 
 Did I mention that I really, really,  really  hate the baby boomers?

 An awesome rant. You summed it all up. Suddenly, my entire f**king life makes a lot more sense. This explains why I've grown to despise my job, most of the people I work with, and the company I work for soooooooo much.

 I think you hit the nail on the head with respect to Boomers in a corporate environment. My last office job was like that, only worse because it was Boomer family nepotism. Not only did a Boomer put his Boomer brothers and sisters in charge of everything, their Millennial kids were also given jobs they were not remotely qualified for. This left the brunt of the work on Gen-X shoulders, and Gen-Xers had to babysit in both directions: We had to teach Boomers how to set margins in Word and we had to teach their kids how to behave in an office. This, of course, left precious little time for us to get our work done. Fifteen months of that nonsense, and I walked out. The Boomer boss got in my face one too many times with her snotty, "do as I say, not as I do" micromanagement attitude, and I stood up, packed up, and walked out.

 Also, I meant to say, fortunately, it was not that way in any non-profit I've ever worked for. There, they stayed true to peace, love, and happiness. I've had Boomer bosses in the non-profit sector who were outstanding.

 We Gen Xers need to start are own companies (with the help of one another -- rise up together -- and strategically not hire the Boomers or the Gen Ys. This is the only way this matter can be solved. These people will never leave. It's crazy!

 Well, yeah, if I had my own organization I definitely would avoid hiring boomers, although this might lead to charges of age-ism. 
 I don't know if a Gen X business owner (wait -- isn't that an oxymoron? Hee hee hee…) could avoid hiring both boomers AND Gen Y'ers, though. I find a lot of Gen Y'ers to be good, sharp, talented people, more so than the percentage of baby boomers I find to be worth a shit.

 I absolutely love this article. Technically, as an adjunct faculty member, it isn't PC to agree with the sentiment's expressed in this article, but I finally got to the point where I grew tired of seeing grey hair in the workplace. I have hated Boomers since I was a child, and they just get worse as they age. They're ruining this country; education is, perhaps, the most obvious arena that they've completely destroyed, and they won't allow those of us who are far more educated and qualified to fix a single thing.

 Yup. Lots of people say of some group, "They're ruining this country," but the only group that actually is doing that is the baby boomers. They are causing much more damage than the "terrorists" ever could -- and I'm not being flip. 
 Two jobs ago I worked for a state government personnel office, and one of its functions was "workforce planning." The idea was that with the baby boomers retiring, it would be a huge loss, and this loss had to be prepared for. Oh, please! One Gen X'er can do the work of at least two or three boomers, and the BEST thing that could happen to any organization is that it loses its boomers, who, as you correctly noted, only act as human roadblocks. And the very idea that the boomers actually would retire anyway! No, their plan is to remain in our way, like deadwood, for as long as they humanly can. To hear  them  tell it, they are indisposable.

 The accusations about overpaid boomers seem fairly consistent with my own experiences. 
 My self-indulgent boomer colleagues take extravagant vacations, are paid 150% more than I am, and yet more is expected of me than they have ever delivered in their lives. Worst of all these guys absolutely expect me to kiss their asses on a daily basis. Doing their work for them is bad stuff. But the expectation that I should admire or want to be mentored by no talent hacks is utterly infuriating. 
 I may get fired for not doing building their pedestal high enough, but at least I can sleep with myself at night. 
 I'm an academic like Laura, and I'd argue that higher education is more corrupt that Wall St. ever was. Too many grant $$, too many draft-dodging gray hairs who were out for themselves, not because of a calling to educate.
