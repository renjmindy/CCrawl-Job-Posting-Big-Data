  3 Tips For Finding A Purpose-Driven Job  
 Ryan Niessen 
 December 22, 2016 
 
 If you've had your ear to the ground lately, then you may have heard about this rapidly growing movement. It's made up of a group of people who are tired of working boring, meaningless jobs, and ready to do whatever it takes to live life on their terms. No more Office Spacestyle workplaces. No more quarter-life crisis', and spending the majority of your work day finding ways to look busy as you suppress your anger at wasting your life awayâ€¦ (By the way - there's a better way to work at the bottom of this article.) This movement is about changing the game from surviving to thriving, from working for a just a paycheck to working for a purpose and a paycheck. It's about a new game, where your authentic strengths, values, and passions are contributed daily to a worthy cause, and you go to bed at night exhausted, yet happy - satisfied with what you accomplished that day. It's about you getting a... 
 
 Purpose-Driven Job For A Purpose-Driven Company 
 See, purpose-driven companies strive to make a profit as well as a difference in the world. They minimize their environmental footprint because it's the right thing to do, and they treat their employees like human beings - empowering them to grow and contribute their unique skills. Having a purpose-driven job means that you feel good about contributing your time, effort, and skills to a worthy cause, and you're proud to tell your family and friends what you do. And as an added bonus, these types of companies typically have the best work environments and benefits, with a focus on fun and growth in the workplace. Imagine variations of Google's famous headquarters - like the Malaysian digital marketing company Mindvalley - and you'll see why working for this type of company could be the future of your career. 
 How To Get A Purpose-Driven Job 
 Here are a few tips for getting a purpose-driven job: 
 1. Know Where To Look 
 Thanks to sites like the GameChangers 500 - which is a list of the world's top purpose-driven companies, like Google, TOMS shoes, and Patagonia - this is getting easier to do all the time. But before you dive into the list and start sending out resumes, you need to know that the traditional resume and cover letter approach is not going to work here. In fact, if you're planning on making a small tweak to you cover letter before mailing it out, then you might as well not bother. You'd be wasting your time. These companies are the way of the future, and they require a new approach in order to get their attention... 
 2. Match Your Mission 
 These GameChanging companies have a definitive purpose and clear core values, and they are only hiring people who are in alignment with them. So, before you apply, you need to figure out what matters most to you, and what kind of contribution you want to make - and then match that up with a company that values the same thing. 
 3. Stand Out 
 Once you find the best organization(s) for you, you need a way to get their attention in a unique and creative way. See, these companies want people who aren't afraid to authentically express their strengths, passions, and values, and with all of the amazing tools available on the internet these days, that's easier than ever to do. So, figure out what your ideal purpose-driven job is and find a company that fits - and then use your creativity to stand out and get the job. And if you need a little help, I've teamed up with the founder of the GameChangers 500 to put together a free video with more tips you can apply today to get your purpose-driven job.
