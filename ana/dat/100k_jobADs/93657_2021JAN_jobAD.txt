 Step 1 In Landing That Job: Take Inventory 
 Job Search Advice 
 Taking InventoryWhether it's looking for a job because you are out of work, or looking for a promotion, I don't think you can get better initial advice than to take an inventory and KNOW yourself. 
 In any interview process where a job is up for competition the overall point of an interview is the employer, (as represented by their interviewer), is getting to know you better so they can ultimately decide if what you have to offer will fulfill their current and/or future needs. 
 So what is 'knowing yourself' all about? 
 1. Know  what  is prompting you to consider a position. Are you looking for an increase in your income, a change of scenery, a move to a new community, is it economic necessity or desperation? Have you had your eye on a specific opportunity and it's finally opened up to external candidates? Are your parents forcing you to get a job or perhaps the spouse is egging you on to get a big promotion so the status you'll get will also apply to them? 
 2. Know your  strengths . If the things that you do well are strong requirements for the job, you'll be more confident and able to demonstrate those strengths in an interview. This is turn makes it easier for the interviewer to see you in the role, performing the duties and succeeding. 
 3. Know your  weaknesses . Thinking of the promotion, the new responsibilities beyond those you currently have, or the completely different things you'll have to do from what you are currently doing, what would you need some time, training, support and guidance to achieve? Even in a case where you believe you could do the job right from day 1, are you really saying that three or four months into the job you'll be no more efficient than you will be on day 1? That's what, "I have no weaknesses" would mean and you're either outright lying or you don't know the job and yourself all that well and how the two will impact on each other. 
 4. Know your  needs . If you require a certain shift, compensation level, accommodation due to health etc., you should be in clear possession of that data right from the beginning. If you aren't aware of these, you might end up wasting your time and that of the employer which will only end badly and leave them thinking you've wasted their time. That could really mess up future advancement. 
 5. Know  what jobs lead to other jobs . Sometimes you'll hear of people who apply for a job, get the interview but the job is offered to another candidate. In feedback sessions, the person is often told they need more perspective and experience; so taking a lateral position in another department or under a different Supervisor is required in order to be more diversified. Diversified simply means you'll bring a wider perspective to the supervisory role you ultimately want. Doing nothing but your current job could mean you'll be forever passed over and held back. 
 6. Know what  sparks interest . What are you motivated to actually do? Are you the creative sort who likes re-working existing practices and procedures, delving into new and better ways to work? Or conversely, are you the sort who gets a buzz from pleasing others, providing outstanding customer service or inventing things that save people time? What turns you on? 
 7. Know what you find  deadly boring . Knowing what you don't want to do is often just as important as knowing what you do. Start ruling things out. Can you see your brain cells dying as you perform some manual labour job in a factory setting? Would you hate being in a position where you type letters and take inventory again and again and again? Where some thrive, some die. Good advice for the teenager and even those into their twenties is to try a number of careers and jobs before feeling you have to pick one and that's it for life. It isn't; people often change jobs or careers 8 or 9 times in their adult working life. 
 8. Know your  potential . Do you usually sell yourself short or do you even want to live up to your potential? Everybody has potential by the way - everybody. Some have amazing potential to move mountains and change the very fabric of society by developing new energy sources, new communication models, new technologies. Good for them, we need them. But someone with a disability has potential too. Rather than focusing on limitations, what CAN you accomplish? That's potential. And as for the risk of failing? Who hasn't at some point or other? 
 9. Know  people . Network and talk to people. Find things in common with them and don't be afraid to initiate communication. What's the worst that could really happen? When you know people, and think about this….THEY KNOW YOU. Ahhhhhh….. And when people know you they are in a position to help you with information, tips, leads, references, insider data, and all of this can lead to your success. 
 10. Know ____________________. There are more than 10 convenient things you should know in order to really say you know yourself. And so, what would you add as number 10 on the 'Knowing Yourself Inventory'? 
 All of these things translate into applying for the right job; one that will be a good fit. You'll do better at interviews too, because you'll know more about the job and yourself than ever before. That means you answer with stronger answers and more confidence.
