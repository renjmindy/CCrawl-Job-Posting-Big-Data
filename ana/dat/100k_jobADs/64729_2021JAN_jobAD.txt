 I'm a graduate of BS in Commerce and also a certified caregiver. 
I'm currently in Singapore today as a live-in caregiver with 61y/0 woman with a history of A.V.M. and depression. My contract will finish this December. 
I want to apply as caregiver to Canada but I'm having a hard time looking for an agency who will help me because I have no day-off. 
Any established agency who can help me?…. 
Tnx
