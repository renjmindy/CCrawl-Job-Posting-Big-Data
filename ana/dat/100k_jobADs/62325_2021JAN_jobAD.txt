 Top 5 Freelance Jobs You Can Do from Home 
 March 2, 2018  Employment   freelance job ,  home job   0 
 
 The thought of working from home may bring to mind a leisurely lifestyle sitting on your couch in your pajamas and sipping your morning coffee while plugging away on your computer. This is much more appealing than your current reality of fighting traffic back and forth to the office, feeling micromanaged by an overbearing boss and dealing with conflicts with your co-workers. 
 Some people use home -based freelancing jobs as part-time income, and some transition into a brand new career working entirely from home. This can give you a sense of freedom in your daily life, and it may even help you to boost your income. 
 With that in mind, here are five freelancing careers you can consider doing to earn a great income while working from home. 
 Writing 
 If you have decent writing  skills , becoming a freelance writer is a great option. This is one of the most common careers to consider doing from home. You can easily make this a part-time or a full-time gig based on how much time you have available to put into it. 
 Your options are quite wide here. You could be a blog writer, a technical writer, an editor, a copywriter or even a content manager. 
 Freelance writers may earn up to $30 per hour, but remember that you typically must be an excellent writer to earn top dollar in this field. Your ability to write well and to be efficient in the process is essential in order to maximize your income as a freelance writer. 
 Digital Marketing 
 If you have a background in marketing or advertising, you may be able to work as a freelance marketer by creating and executing online marketing campaigns. This may include tasks related to social media marketing, email marketing, content marketing, paid advertising and search engine optimization. 
 You could expect to earn up to $25 per hour if you establish an excellent client base. If you are successful in your efforts, you may even be able to  start  a home-based business and hire a few employees to work under you. 
 Web Development 
 Websites are a veritable necessity for standard business operations in most industries today, and there is considerable demand for web development services. Many businesses prefer to outsource this task to a freelance website designer rather than to pay a fortune working with a professional development firm. 
 This job may require you to manage a site, integrate applications with available site tools, offer technical support to your clients, improve the existing architecture of a website, test software and more. Your income will vary dramatically based on how efficiently you work, your experience level and more. Some of the more skilled freelance developers may earn more than $100,000 per year. 
 Graphic Design 
 Graphic images are essential for many marketing and advertising campaigns as well as for creation of logos, use in video games and more. As a graphic designer, you likely will be on-call with multiple businesses that you  establish  lasting relationships with. 
 You may work on designing and creating various website graphics, promotional material and much more. You can reasonably expect to earn up to $21 per hour if you are successful. 
 Teaching and Tutoring 
 If you are experienced or well-trained in a specific area, such as math, science or foreign languages, you may be able to teach students online. There are various tutoring platforms that you could work through to find clients, or you may even teach a class over the course of several months. 
 You may need to create online video lectures, be available for live video-based tutoring, write lesson plans and more. Some online teachers and tutors earn up to $28 per hour. 
 Final Thoughts 
 Working from home may sound like a dream come true, but remember that real work is required. Some people who begin working from home with the thought that they can slack off and not put in a full day's worth of work may notice that their income-producing abilities and their overall ability to be successful wanes. If you are serious about putting forth the effort to work from home, spend time exploring each of these money-making career options that may be well-suited for your experiences, skills and background.
