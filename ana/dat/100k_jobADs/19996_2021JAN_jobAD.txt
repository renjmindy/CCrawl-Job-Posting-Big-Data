 Career Coaching 
 | 
 Robin Roman Wright 
 "I am passionate about offering career development services. I help individuals define their purpose, set goals and act using proven coaching facilitation techniques." 
 
 Location:  Wilmington, Massachusetts 
 
 How will clients benefit with you as their coach? 
 
 
 Strategize life goals - family, work, church, personal and community. 
 
 
 Articulate the specific skills and talents that you bring to a prospective employer. 
 
 
 Identify occupational choices that align with your career interests, desired work environment, and transferable skills. 
 
 
 Put a career game plan in motion. 
 
 
 Focus a job search and maximize job hunting activities. 
 
 
 Use information from a personal assessment to improve relationships with current or future superiors and enhance peer networks.
 What results have clients reported after working with you? 
 
 
 Increased insight and improved business results after one coaching session. 
 
 
 Clarity about career direction for next year or two in just 4 sessions. 
 
 
 Improved resume for person seeking a mid-level professional position after many years in one company.
 What do clients say about working with you? 
 
 
 "Thank you. You took the time to listen to my heart and share with me about the assessment. I was overwhelmed by the accuracy of the report and how clearly it denoted my skills and abilities and gave me clarity in areas I always wondered about." --- A client in career transition 
 
 
 "[Robin] is a fantastic listener and is able to engage participants across differences in a way that helps the various voices to be heard and valued. Her ability to facilitate dynamic dialogue is undergirded by her quick thought, clear articulation, diverse experiences and commitment to bringing about robust solutions." -- Facilitator of Boston Capacity Tank, a partnership between the Black Ministerial Alliance (BMA), Emmanuel Gospel Center, Boston Ten Point Coalition, and the United Way of Massachusetts Bay 
 
 
 Through the personal assessment process, helped a journalist articulate her personal style and understand barriers that kept coming up in her work. 
 
 
 "Thank you for your sharing your insight into leadership with the youth of the Leon de Juda Youth Leadership Seminar. Your presentation did more than merely reinforce the leadership principles the kids were exposed to throughout the Seminar. What you did was make those principles personal and applicable to their God-ingrained style of leadership." -- Director for Youth, Higher Education Resource Center, Boston
 What are 5 strengths you have as a coach? 
 
 
 20 years experience as a Management Development Trainer and Organizational Development Consultant 
 
 
 A passion for, and experience in, running programs for diverse populations in both Corporate and Non-profit environments 
 
 
 A bicultural perspective - I am Puerto Rican and Irish and have experience working to bring about social justice and racial reconciliation 
 
 
 A deep respect for the dignity of each individual 
 
 
 Compassionate listening skills 
 
 
 Laser questioning and probing skills - helping clients get "unstuck" 
 
 
 Expert knowledge of a variety of career planning tools and processes that I can customize for individual needs.
 What is your coaching philosophy? 
 
 
 
 Using an empowerment model, I help clients identify what they have to offer the marketplace and where in the world of work they might be most valued and satisfied. Each person has unique contributions that he or she can offer in the workplace. People have experience, talents, skills and fields of knowledge that they have developed throughout their lifetimes whether on the job, in school, at home or in volunteer positions. Coaching provides time for reflection and discovery. It also provides time for clarification of work life/ balance goals and personal as well as professional values. I use proven models of career exploration such as "The What Color is Your Parachute" model by Richard N. Bolles and SDS Self-Directed SEARCH model by John L Holland, PhD. I am passionate about offering career development services. I help individuals define their purpose, set goals and act using proven coaching facilitation techniques.

 Professionals seeking to move up or broaden their career experience 
 
 
 Entrepreneurs seeking to strengthen leadership skills 
 
 
 Professional women seeking work life balance 
 
 
 Downsized workers seeking to hone their job searching plan and maximize their networking activities 
 
 
 People in transition seeking a more fulfilling career opportunity
 What is your professional background?

 Designed and launched a Diversity Mentoring Program for the Information Technology Division of a large regional financial institution. The purpose of the program was to provide career mentoring and increase awareness and appreciation of differences in others.
