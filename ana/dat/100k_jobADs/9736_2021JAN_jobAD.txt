 Job Center Remodel 
 We want customers of all backgrounds to feel good about entering our job centers. We would like job seekers to feel positive that their next opportunity is on the other side of their visit. We know that along with great staff and resources, we need a space that reflects these goals and we are well on our way to completion. 
 Work has continued throughout the summer to update the facilities at the Wheaton American Job Center. New carpet has been installed and fresh paint applied to our facilities on the 5th, 4th, 2nd, and 1 st floors of the Westfield Wheaton South building. We are also in the process of purchasing new furniture for the resource room and will also install a new ADA accessible work station. The last of the painting and carpeting will be completed in September and it is our goal to have new furniture, including new computer carrels and chairs, in the resource room in the early Fall. 
 While the fresh paint, new carpet, and furniture will vastly improve the look of the facility, we are proud to make these changes not purely for cosmetic reasons. These updates will provide not only a more welcoming environment for our job seekers, but it will also contribute to improving customer flow. The re-alignment of the information desk and improved workspaces for training and meetings will enhance the experience for our customers as they conduct their career search. These changes will also enable us to expand the population we are serving in Montgomery County by providing a more dignified and professional space.
