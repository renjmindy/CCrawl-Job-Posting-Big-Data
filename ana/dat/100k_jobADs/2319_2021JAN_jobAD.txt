 Working at winkler 
 winkler is a modern company which has always remained a family business at heart. This is why we think it is very important to work together, to enjoy straightforward mutual co-operation – and for our employees to take responsibility for their thoughts and actions. This has been the basis of our success for over 100 years. And a good starting point for you to continue your personal and professional development. At one of over 40 locations in 7 countries. After all, as one of the leading commercial vehicle parts dealers in Europe, winkler offers plenty of prospects.  
 Training at winkler 
 Almost 1,700 people work at winkler, continuing our company history of over 100 years. Training at winkler also has a very long tradition: our aim has always been to train our up-and-coming specialists ourselves, so basic and in-service training have always played a very significant part for. 
 Who are we looking for? 
 At winkler, we are generally looking for employees who are capable of implementing and living our brand promise "If it's from winkler, it'll be right". 
People with a positive attitude to life. People who are open, communicative and reliable and prepared to continue writing winkler's company history, already over 100 years old.  If that sounds like you, you sound like us. 
 Sales 
 We are particularly interested in two kinds of qualification: engineers with sales in their blood (from automotive/commercial vehicle or agricultural engineering backgrounds, for example) or sales staff with good technical knowledge – both these suit winkler very well. 
 The ideal, of course, is a background in the commercial vehicle spare parts business. But we will also give committed and communicative people switching industries a chance – for example, if they come from sectors like buses, hydraulics, tank/dry bulk truck, electronics/diagnostics, compressed air and the like. 
 Warehousing and logistics 
 Ideally you are a trained warehousing/logistics specialist. But we also like employees who trained as automotive mechanics or in retail. Above all, if they have knowledge of the goods management/logistics sphere or are simply interested in it. 
 The basic prerequisite for all employees in warehousing and logistics is: we are looking for colleagues who like to get actively involved and are tough. 
 Technical Centre 
 In our Technical Centre, we are aiming for expensive parts with a long value-creation chain, because that is more ecological and energy-saving than fitting new parts. 
 For this, we are looking above all for true specialists in commercial vehicle repair, hydraulic cylinder repair and welding. As our Technical Centre facilitates a great many solutions outside common standards, such as special repairs or welding work, for example, we especially welcome employees who look beyond the ends of their noses, enjoy a puzzle and are not afraid of complicated technical challenges.
