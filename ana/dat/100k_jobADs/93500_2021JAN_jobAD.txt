 Just Go And Do It! 
 Posted on  July 27, 2017  by  Jasmine 
 Trying to find that perfect design placement, internship or career boost is really difficult. Since my redundancy I have been searching, interviewed and coming so close yet no cigar for months now. 
 Every piece of feedback has been useful and given me the confidence to keep going. The latest from Something Big, to practice my skills to get faster and better as well as to have more 'image & text' based designs in my portfolio. Also to not give up. This was the most valuable and helpful piece of advice I have received so far. It's made me realise where I can improve. 
 (The trouble is just getting round to doing it.) 
 A new venture has also started, it's just getting on to it's feet; this venture is called 'Off The Grid, Design & Marketing'. A group of designers and freelancers available to take on any brief! I have been a part of the branding and naming of the group, which was really enjoyable. It gave me something to do, as well as to collaborate with one of my friends whose been in the industry for 20 + years. 
 I'm hoping it works out!

 A short updateâ€¦ or somewhat 
 Posted on  June 26, 2017  by  Jasmine 
 Since my last post I have had so many interviews that my confidence has rocked sky highâ€¦ however none have been successful; It's starting to feel like false hope. It's a tough world out there, but I am still moving forward and trying my best. 
 Recently I went to Samfest, a local music festival in Tongham. Normally I go with my friends, but this year was different! I went with my aunty, uncle and little cousins!!! 
I stayed till the end amongst the crowd and of course the rain. It was good to see some familiar faces one of the bar men and one of the organisers. 
 The acts were great, my favourite though was The Flying Wright Bros. always a pleasure to see them perform rock and classic rock acts! 
 I took my poi with me, where I had lots of space to play. Having not spun in a while it was definitely hard work but the people loved it all the same!!! (The bar man knows me for my tankard and poi skills at a different event). A guy with a camera also enjoyed filming my antics, it was a good day out and all for charity too! 
 I am still trying to come up with some ideas for side projects, so far I have thought about: 
 
 Designing album covers with self generated imagery, picking out random words from a dictionary / online generator / news articles / books etc. for the band name and album name 
 
 
 Designing tiki style prints 
 
 
 Designing a Zine about something or rather 
 
 (100 daysâ€¦ I have given up because I have creative bloq and can't seem to think of anything good to make into an animated gif)

 Game Jam | General Updateâ€¦. 
 Posted on  June 23, 2016  by  Jasmine 
 A couple of weeks ago, I took part in the University Of Portsmouth: Game Jamâ€¦. it was a week of working 9 - 5 with a lunch break in between, working in a team to build a game in a week. We had three themes to work with, Canadian Master Chef Episodes, Water Jousting and Sickle Cell Anaemia. Safe to say, all the outcomes were pretty awesome, my team named Pickle Shark, based out concept on Master Chef and Water Jousting, you can see the out come  here . 
 It was very fun and I learned how easy it was to create UI Graphics. (yeahâ€¦ all right, I did the easy bitâ€¦ the programmers and the other artist did the harder work). 
 Other news, I've applied to several design opportunities, unsure if anything will happen but trying to stay hopeful. Also, in two weeks I will be exhibiting at New Designers â€“ Part 2, which is going to be exciting!!!! 
 In this break, I have been practising some lettering, which can be seen on my  Instagram , among type hunting and a Ziggy Stardust Scarecrow, which became a bonkers Friday nightâ€¦ Who knew there was such a thing, called a 'Scarecrow Festival'? It's pretty insane and fun too! 
 That's all for now folks
