 I'm sourcing a Project Manager capable of leading high-profile capex projects for a stable, highly profitable pharmaceutical manufacturer based in Warrington. 
 My client is a household name within the pharmaceuticals industry; stable, profitable, growing and with a clear business plan for their continued development, it's a great time to join their business. 
 The Project Manager will lead capital investment projects up to £3m value, fully responsible from cradle to grave in ensuring projects are delivered on time and to budget or better. You will manage stakeholders across all functions and at all levels, to ensure their commitment to project deliverables and timely completion of tasks, influencing where needed to hit project milestones in line with your own plan. You will also work in a process improvement capacity, recommending & justifying improvement opportunities across the site, and leading their execution once signed off. 
 Your projects will be high-profile, with the UK site often used to launch products that are subsequently rolled out globally, so your role will have far-wide strategic impact on the organisation; you must also be comfortable evaluating the lessons learned from your projects, enabling plants around the world to improve on your benchmark if needed. 
 You will be an experienced Project Manager or Project Engineer with a track record delivering multi-million-pound capital investment projects; pharmaceutical manufacturing experience is critical, as well as an Engineering degree. Earlier career experience in Process or Manufacturing Engineering is advantageous but not essential. 
 Based in Warrington, the successful candidate will be paid up to £53,000 basic salary plus benefits including 15% performance-related bonus, private healthcare and pension. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
