 Experiences of Chanting “FIND DIVINE ORDER BETWEEN NOW” -> 
 Job Satisfaction 
 Feb 3 
 Posted by  NaranTeam 
 I was Job less for four months and started Chanting Switch Words, ”FIND DIVINE ORDER COUNT NOW DONE”. I had written the switch words in a piece of paper and kept it under my pillow. I am happy to report you that, two days back I have got job with my satisfaction, and I have started going from today.
