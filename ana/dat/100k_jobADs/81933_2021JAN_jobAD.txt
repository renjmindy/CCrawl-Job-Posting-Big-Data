 What is your coaching philosophy? 
 
 People are often discouraged from pursuing change or improvements in their lives because they judge themselves incapable or their dreams impossible and unattainable. What surprises people is that if they take small steps toward change, their lives unfold with richness, purpose and direction. I help people identify those initial steps and partner with them to create a framework of action to realize their goals and vision. 
 
 What types of people do you typically coach? 
 
 
 My expertise is assisting those who wish to enhance or change their careers. I help clients do critical foundational work of identifying their strengths, abilities and preferences. From this place of understanding, we explore strategies to obtain work that is a true fit and that is satisfying and fulfilling. 
 
 
 I typically coach people who are interested in exploring career change and those who are in the job search process. I have worked with people from all fields but specialize with those in I.T, creative, educational, social service and human resource fields. I support clients who approach life with a spiritual perspective.
 What is your professional background? 
 
 
 As a career counselor, coach and consultant, Georgiana has extensive experience in career assessment, career development and all aspects of effective work search techniques. As a professional librarian, she developed expertise in accessing and delivering information. She has a diverse background in social services in the nonprofit sector, higher education and outplacement. With a personal interest in creativity, she often works with clients exploring the arts as a vocation or avocation.
