 Tag Archives: Can't Get Experience Without a Job

 Working Girl 
 Now I wrote this post while I was job hunting, over a year ago, and for some reason forgot to post it. 
 So I am posting it now. Since then I currently work at three jobs, all ones I am very happy to be at. But prior to that, it was a long, hard, rejection-filled process, 
 So most think that after graduation they will get a job right away. They studied hard, worked hard, interned, etc. 
 But that's not how it is. Finding a job is hard out there. 
 When I was looking almost everything either wanted me to give my time for free or have ten years experience. I guess I should have started working as a preteen. Oh wait, that's  illegal . 
 I mean have you ever seen  The Secret of My Success  starring Michael J. Fox? That movie speaks to me like no other. 
 When he starts trying to get a job, no one will hire him for his age. Too short, too young, etc. 
 It can be annoying.  Real annoying. 
 But one day you will find something that uses your particular skill set. 
 No I'm not talking about that. 
 It might not be what you were expecting. It might not be what you thought you would do. But you keep hunting and you will find someone something. 
 Hope you enjoyed that blast from the past Yep it a lot of nos, but then I finally got a yes (3) and I'm very happy at all the places I work at now. 
 Good luck all you still searching out there!

 O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree 
 
 So I don't know about you all but my family actually cuts down our Christmas Tree. We always go the day after Thanksgiving to the black friday sales, and then a few hours to the forest to cut down our tree. 
 
 Now some of you may wonder why we would go through so much trouble? Why not buy a fake one? Well I'll tell you why: 
 1)  The permit to cut down a tree only costs $10. That means you can get as big a tree you want for only ten bucks! For instance we got a 12 foot tree for 5% of the cost of buying one from a lot. 
 
 2)  Cutting down your Christmas tree is very good for the environment. 
 
 I know many of you have just read that and are probably saying to yourselves this girl is stupid, but just hear me out. You see trees grow in clumps and while that is a great thing as they share resources, protect each other, pollinate each other, etc. However, at times this can be bad. Sometimes trees grow too close together that they are unable to get their share. Often times one, or all, the trees will die as there isn't enough to go around. Cutting down your own Christmas tree from one of the clumps means that one side might be a little thinner (you just aim that side in the corner) and it helps the other trees grow big and strong. Also periodically clearing out sections of trees protects them in the summer when there are threats of forest fires. And of course, this cutting isn't a free for all. You can only cut from certain sections, therefore protecting a wider majority of trees. You also have restrictions on the tree size. Your trunk can only have a diameter of 6 inches and there is a restriction of high the stump can be. These regulations keep older trees protected, along with making sure people are not cutting off the tops and leaving the rest of the tree. 
 
 That's a lot! 
 3)  Cutting your own tree means that it will last longer. You see one of the biggest problems with tree lots is that these trees are cut at the end of November, shipped over to the city they will be sold, and hanging around on pavement until they are sold. They are not getting the same TLC or water and a lot of them die really early, shedding tons of pine needles along the way. Now when you cut your own tree, it is nice and fresh and lasts much, much longer. As I said we always get our tree at the end of November and take it down at the end of January. We could keep it up longer, but usually by February we are packing up our Christmas stuff. Besides longevity, it also smells absolutely wonderful. 
 
 And with cutting down your tree there are always adventures. Three years ago I went with my parents and we brought my two nieces, my nephew, and our dog. We hiked all over the area in the snow looking for the perfect tree. 
 We finally found it and my dad cut it down using a manpowered saw rather than a chainsaw. I tried to help him but it was hard work and both of us were pooped. He was really tired so I had him rest and had to carry that tree on my own. Let me say, I'm never doing that again. It was sooo heavy! I don't know how I was able to carry it even for a minute. 
 
 After my dad's rest we finished moving the tree to the truck. After that I had to carry the three kids as the snow embankments had grown larger, and they wouldn't be able to make it out. Yep, every time I feel like something is too hard, difficult, or heavy, I just remind myself that I carried a tree down a mountainside. I rule! 
 
 And this year wasn't any duller. There was no snow as we've been suffering some strong dry spells, but we still had a lot of fun hiking up and down the mountainside for that perfect tree. When we found it we cut it down (using a chainsaw this time) and started to head down the mountainside. Now, we've been doing this since I was like 13, but this year something happened that had never happened before. 
 As we started down the hill trying to bring the tree to the truck, my dad yelled at us to turn the tree as he wanted the weaker side pointed to the ground as that side was to lay in the flatbed. As we turned the tree, BAM! SMACK! 
 
 The tree branches kept smacking me in the face. And when I mean kept, I meant it didn't stop. I guess it was the section of the tree I was in, but I couldn't see a thing, just branches and branches smacking me in the face. 
 I felt as if it was like in  The Wizard of Oz  when the trees come to life and start smacking Dorothy. 
 
 It was almost like it was mad at me for me cutting it down. 
 When we got home we got it out of the truck and was taking it into the house and had to turn the tree again. Now this time I had stood on the opposite side of the tree, hoping that would keep it from hitting me, but now once again tree slap. 
 
 Hair everywhere, I can't see a thing, I'm afraid my glasses might get knocked off and go flying, and I am praying so hard that I do not fall in our pool. 
 
 Luckily we get it in the stand and straighten it out. And boy does it look lovely. It kind of makes up for the abuse it gave me. 
 Now my abuse from the tree branches doesn't end there. Oh, no! You see after I graduated and interned this summer; I moved back home. I've been trying to find a job, but this is pretty much what it is like. 
 
 So to fill the time until I am hopefully hired, I am volunteering at quite a few places. One of which is my local museum. So last week I headed down there as it was my turn to work the desk. I brought with me some pine clippings from our tree as the museum was decorating for Christmas. Well it turned out that they didn't have as many volunteers as they hoped, so they asked me to help with the decorating. I thought okay, it will be fun. 
 
 So I thought decorating meant we were going to hang ornaments on the tree. 
 
 
 We were making these giant wreaths. 
 
 So I was paired with one of the volunteers and let me just stop and share something with you. Most of the volunteers at the museum are older, like 60+. So the woman I had wasn't the most helpful. You see you take branches of the tree and put them on a plastic doughnut, tying them down with string or wire as you go along. Adding more and more branches until it is filled. However, that's not what happened here. My helper laid tons of branches down and then sat down as she couldn't tie them on. I tried to tie the branches down, but the wreath slipped and they all went crashing to the floor. 
 
 Noooooooooo!!!!!!! 
 Yep, I had to do everything over, but this time I did it right. As I continued, more people came and helped out which was nice. It was a really hard process though as it had rained for the past three days, and all their tree clippings were soaked, making the already hard job of trying to tie them down even harder! 
 
 Replace Rothbart with wreath 
 Finally we had completed it and I was tired. It's a lot of bending over and being pricked/stabbed by the wire and tree branches. I sat down for a bit but then had to move on to making garland. 
 
 OMG it was so hard. You have a piece of rope and have to twist tie the branch to the rope. Yep, those flimsy little twisty ties. IT TAKES FOREVER! You keep placing branches over and over each other to make it fuller and until you cover the rope.  This is extremely hard . At times I was trying to use one of those flimsy things to tie three branches together! And because a lot of people had to leave, I had to do it all on my own. By one fourth of the way I wanted to burn the thing. 
 
 We had a time limit to this as at noon the county was sending over free labor and the right machine to hang this things high up on the walls. So when every team completed theirs and saw I wasn't even at the halfway point they all descended on me to help out. 
 Now you think this would have been nice, and it would have if it was one or two, but there were like five trying to take over the tying or telling me what to do. It made me feel kind of surly: 
 
 But I just kept to myself, trying to be professional. 
 After that my shift was over and I headed home, bearing more battle wounds that those brought on by the slapping tree. My hands were covered in cuts and they hurt sooo bad, my back was aching from bending over, my feet were sore from standing, etc. But hey beauty is pain, and the place sure did look amazing! 
 
 Merry Christmas!
