 Greetings! 
I was a primary school teacher for 13 years but wish to apply for a nanny job overseas but not in (Middle east)countries. Is there any nanny jobs available for other countries such as: EUROPE, AUSTRALIA,US or any Caribbean countries? I happened to visit Haiti and St. Maarten last 2006-2007. 
Hope to know the right website through your help on nanny jobs available worldwide. (I'm afraid of the scams that are very rampant in the internet nowadays).
