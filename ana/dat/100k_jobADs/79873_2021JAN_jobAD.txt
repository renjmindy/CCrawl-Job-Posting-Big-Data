 Hello, I am looking for an excellent Logo Design for my small start-up business. It is essential the logo has the five characteristics below; (1) Simple - Simple logos are the ones people can recognize as soon as they see them. The simplest logos are the ones people remember the most. (2) Scalable - A great logo should be simple enough to be able to be scaled down or up and still look good. (3) Memorable / Impactful - A great logo should be impactful. You want to capture your viewer's attentions and leave an impression (a positive impression, hopefully). (4) Versatile - A great logo should look equally good on any web device and on any kind of print material. (5) Relevant -A great logo should be relevant to your practice. It has to have meaning that relates to the work you are doing. The budget I have set for the Logo Design is rs 1000 however as I produce many websites and if we work well together for this first project, I'll be in a position to provide you with many other projects in the future. Before being awarded with the project, you must produce one to three draft logos and if I am happy with what you have done, I'll choose you as the designated Logo Maker and award you the project. If you are happy with all the above, please let me know and I can give you more details in terms of my requirements. Thanks
