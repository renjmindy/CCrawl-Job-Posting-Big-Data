 Every now and again, our skin can become dry, dull and a bit sad. 
 Stress, pollution, make-up and diet can all have an impact on how our skin looks and feels, but adding a mask to your beauty routine can help keep things on track. 
 We have had a look at the products we offer at Pure Beauty and we are pretty sure there will be something perfect to get your skin back on track. 
 If you are looking for something special, we would suggest trying the  Jan Marini Luminate Face Mask . This luxury mask improves tone, texture and luminosity, from the very first use. Up to three times a week, apply a thin layer to your face, avoiding the eye area, and leave on for ten minute before washing away with lukewarm water. Exfoliators will gently remove dull, dry skin while calming agents reduce irritation and redness, leaving skin immediately brighter and glowing. 
 If you are looking for a classic, we high suggest the  Dermalogica Skin Hydrating Masque . This easy to use product is perfect for restoring suppleness and reducing the appearance of fine, dry lines caused by dehydration. Botanical extracts of Cucumber, Arnica, Orange and Hops have been added to deal with inflammation and thanks to Vitamins A, C and E, skin is nourished and replenished from the very first application. 
 At Pure Beauty, we love the  Elemis Fruit Active Rejuvenating Mask . Rich in extracts of Strawberry and Kiwi, this clay based mask is a fantastic deep cleansing, moisturising therapy for your skin. After use, the Vitamin C from the fruit extracts means improved elasticity and you are left with a smooth, radiant complexion. 
 If you are time poor, why not try the  Dermalogica Charcoal Rescue Masque . This fast working, easily removed formula is heavenly for tired, dull skin and works wonders. Activated Binchotan Charcoal adsorbs impurities and Sulfur promotes cell turnover so that skin becomes brighter and this is further enhanced by the addition of Volcanic Ash, Sea Silt, Bamboo Extract and alpha hydroxy acids. The result is a skin revolution. 
 For a totally hydrating, soothing treatment, look no further than the  Elemis Exotic Cream Moisturising Mask . A blend of gorgeous ingredients, including Honey, Bergamot and Samphire, not only nourish the skin, but also support the moisture barriers, making it perfect for anyone who works in a highly air condition environment such as an office or retail space. Good to note, that this is a multipurpose product and can also be used as an intensive treatment for dry hands and cuticles. 
 For a little extra pampering, we suggest trying the  Decleor 2 in 1 Purifying and Oxygenating Mask . This products combines an exfoliant with mask to not only cleanse the skin, but hydrate it too. Thanks to Egyptian Loofah Fibres, dead skin cells are washed away and Spheres of White Jojoba swoop in to restore hydration, leaving your skin feeling soft and silky smooth. 
 A real Pure Beauty winner, is the  Dermalogica Multivitamin Power Recovery Masque . Packed with super-concentrated antioxidant vitamins, this is perfect for calming stressed, prematurely-ageing skin. Vitamin A increases elasticity and moisture levels, Vitamin C helps restore suppleness and cool, calming botanical extracts of Liquorice, Comfrey and Burdock soothe the skin leaving it happy once again.
