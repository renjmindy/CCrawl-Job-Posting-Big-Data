 Company Overview 
 Youth Villages 
 Right now, there is a vulnerable child being raised by the state. She will spend her childhood in expensive institutions, being shuffled from foster home to foster home. She will experience unimaginable trauma and, as a result, will be 75% more likely to wind up in institutions or prisons as an adult. Because once kids are in the system, they tend to stay in the system. Communities are searching for real solutions to break this cycle of despair and failure. At Youth Villages, we fiercely believe that building strong families is the answer. Our counselors are a force for families, providing Evidentiary Family Restoration® for kids and parents alike. We do this with one goal in mind: to ensure that each child has a functioning family and a safe, permanent home. Because stronger families result in safer neighborhoods and better communities for everyone.  Learn More
