 Jason Stone—An Entrepreneurial Prodigy 
 
 December 4, 2018  Business   Career Guide ,  Entrepreneur ,  Entrepreneurship ,  Social Influencing ,  social media   
 Charisma. Persistence. Flair. These are the ingredients that constitute the character of a present-day influencer. This is a trio instilled in Jason Stone, a 39-year-old entrepreneur, and motivator, who enjoy  his success and strives to  share it with the world. 
 Jason started off by pursuing his degree in Mechanical Engineering degree from the University of Akron, and with a surprising turn of event, ended up being one of the widely known mentors of the modern world. He owns an Instagram account with over 3M followers to date. 
 The Stepping Stones 
 Jason tapped into his money-making talent when he got the idea to sell used car parts from a junkyard to wholesalers for the nominal price. Furthermore, the soon-to-be engineer also had a thing for guiding and mentoring his friends and family in different arrays of life. 
 After completing his degree, he turned his part-time work into a full-time job by starting a company called, “Treadstone Performance Engineering”. The new venture was, of course, launched with numerous upgrades from his previous-side-business. Treadstone Performance Engineering was launched in 2006 and continues to operate online with hefty profits. 
 Later in 2013, he also invested in his friend’s startup “The Local Door Coupons” where he received enormous success and managed to elevate the profits tenfold. By the end of 12 months with the company, Jason had launched 50 franchises of the business across the nation. 
 Meet the Millionaire Mentor 
 Jason’s innate desire to mentor surfaced when he launched his dedicated Instagram account—Millionaire Mentor. Previously, he did offer motivational lessons through his personal accounts but that concluded as he had to shut them all down due to the home burglary. 
 It took ‘Millionaire Mentor' only a year to reach a million followers. Jason has crossed 3M followers on this account to date and is continuing to go forth with each passing day. He offers paid mentorship lessons for new ventures, motivational content, and social media consultancy to make sure that others can benefit from his experiences through the years. 
 Fame and Fortune 
 Jason Stone is a successful entrepreneur of the modern day. He made $8M in retail sales in 2017, received various awards for surpassing sales targets. He also continued to do philanthropy and donates a portion of all his earnings to charity. He has also appeared in various major releases like Forbes, Huffington Post, Entrepreneur, Inc.com, FourHundred Magazine, Home Business Magazine, and several others who have mentioned Jason as one of the leading mentors and entrepreneurs of the modern age. 
 Jason Stone is on a mission to impact over a billion people with his efforts. He continues to work at Millionaire Mentor while running his other business ventures on the side. Jason is happily married to Cristina Stone and has 2 children. He can be reached through his Instagram @Millionaire_Mentor.
