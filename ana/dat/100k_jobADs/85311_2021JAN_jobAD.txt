 Position: Front-end Developer 
 Start Date: Immediate

 Contract Duration: Permanent with 3 month trial period

 Boxhead is a design & development studio that helps brands create and maintain meaningful engagements with people by creating websites, apps and digital experiences. Our offering is simple, we design and develop websites, online services, apps and content for ambitious clients. We help long established organisations become agile, digital natives. We help startups scale by implementing robust digital platforms and infrastructure. 
 Boxhead collaborates and partners with studios and agencies looking to deliver interesting and technically challenging digital products and services. We are a focussed studio of designers and developers working in concert to deliver projects that put values first and make positive impact in communities, both local and global. 
 About You 
 We’re looking for someone who’s serious about front-end technologies but also has a keen eye for nice design …and really cares what the end product looks like on screen. We like to challenge ourselves, so we’re looking for someone who’s really open to testing out new technologies when the opportunity presents itself. We won’t count the number of years experience you have. We will judge you on your technical capability, demonstrable experience and ability to integrate into our team well on a trial day. 
 Working at Boxhead 
 At Boxhead, employees work no more than a 4 day work week. That extra day can be used to pursue interests, rest or involve themselves in causes of value. We’re not a ‘poster can save the world’ kind of studio. We love design, we love code, we also know that pushing pixels around a screen isn’t going to bring about wholesale positive change in the world we live in. Some of our team choose to get involved with a charity, their local church, train for an epic event, or spend more time with their family. 
 About that 4 day work week… we don’t just shut up shop on thursday and take friday off, we have team crossover. As a studio, we are open Monday to Friday. 
 We intentionally describe ourselves as a studio. We have ‘agency’ about us (look it up), but we are not an agency or what a typical digital creative agency has become, or wants to be. At Boxhead, ‘Studio’ is pretty much the collective noun for the individuals that make us who we are… a studio of designers & developers who work on meaningful projects for interesting clients. Not quite as evocative as a ‘Shiver of Sharks’ or ‘Blessing of Unicorns’, but you get the idea.
