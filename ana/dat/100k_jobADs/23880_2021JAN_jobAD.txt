 THE JOB AT BACKBASE 
 Backbase is expanding. In just five years, we grew from 50 to 900 employees and have no intention of stopping yet. 
Technical recruitment is no easy task. We know that. That’s why we’re looking for someone who can identify top talent and own the candidate experience at the same time. Besides developing your network and managing business demand for new hires, you will also create an exemplary experience for all candidates. 
Internally, you manage expectations accurately, being honest about what’s possible and what's not. Acting as the first filter in the application procedure, it’s up to you to save time by selecting only those candidates that for sure will make it to the final round. 
By asking bold, yet brilliant questions, you reveal the candidate's engagement with the process and their aptitude. We believe it's not enough to simply have a keen sense for talent and potency – you may want to add to your knowledge by picking up some programming skills, or learning about bitcoin trading, or anything else that piques your interest. This is the environment to do that, and you will be able to sell the same benefits to candidates. Your approach to the candidate experience will be exemplary – so much so that even rejected applicants will be full of commendation for you and our company. 
You will incorporate employee branding growth and consider gap analysis to improve our Cardiff set up. In order to do that, you will work closely with the teams to define a roadmap and execute accordingly.  apply now
