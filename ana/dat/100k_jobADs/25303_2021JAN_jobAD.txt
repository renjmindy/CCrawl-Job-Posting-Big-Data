 22 Grand Job - The Rakes 
 The Rakes… I have their album. I've even played it a few times. What can I tell you about it?

 " 22 Grand Job, In the City it's alright, 22 Grand Job, In the City it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright!" 
 This is not meant as an insult to The Rakes. More a testament to the brilliance of their hit single. 22 Grand Job. It's not alright. It's a mini classic!
