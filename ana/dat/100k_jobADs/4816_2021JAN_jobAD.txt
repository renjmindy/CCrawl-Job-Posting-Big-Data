 On Deck 
 
 Overview 
 On Deck is building a modern education institution: helping the worldâ€™s most talented, ambitious people learn the skills and build the networks they need to start â€” or get in on the ground floor of the next great tech companies. 
 Our core offering is the  On Deck Fellowship : an intensive 10-week program offering extensive expert-led curriculum, and building community around a group of experienced engineers, designers, operators, and repeat founders. Once  described as   â€œjoining a great company full of super talented peopleâ€”and proceeding straight to the "mafia" phase." 
 To date, 450 Fellows have founded around 180 companies, and raised over $90M from some of the best investors in the world. Over the coming years, On Deck will seed many thousands of new world-changing startups, and you have the opportunity to be a part of their journey from day zero. 
 We also just  announced  the On Deck Angel Fellowship, helping world-class operators answer these questions and more; build their co-investor networks, hone their skills, and develop their capacity to fund and support the next generation of builders. 
 As the community grows, we are building software to scale and manage the community, and create magical experiences for participants. 
 We've already built a lot.  Here's a sneak peek . ðŸ‘€ 
 The Opportunity 
 You will serve as On Deckâ€™s megaphone, amplifying the work of our fellows and team to the masses. You will play a major role in owning the brand voice in major announcements, social media, and creating new email campaigns. 
 Every week during the On Deck Fellowship, we host 20+ hours of programming, including small intimate workshops, webinars, fireside conversations, and more â€” and featuring the foremost thinkers in the technology industry. You will create an online presence that showcases what we do best and attracts more experts to get involved. 
 As the Fellowship grows, this is developing into a content engine like no other. A "MasterClass" for building startups. Your role will be to synthesize this raw content, curate it, and help to create lasting resources for our community: publishing externally to a distribution list of 10,000+ subscribers, and posting internally for our community of Fellows. 
 We will measure success from growth in brand reach and high-quality application volume to our fellowship programs.
