After that, he has been a part of many films where he has given many hit songs. He started his career at a very young age, and he has also released many hit solo albums. His song “Sawan mein Lag Gayi Aag” was also remixed by a US-based singer Pinky Paras. 
 Mika Singh Net worth in rupees 2020: 
 Mika Singh is a playback singer and a live performer in the Bollywood music industry. His primary genre for music is pop, Punjabi songs, and rap. His Net worth as of 2020 is approx—8 Million dollars, which is around 45-50 crores. There is not much information available on how much he charges for an individual song or show. He has not been a very active part in any brand endorsements. Mika has not been seen in any ads on television or has promoted any brand. So his primary source of income is from the music that he does. 
 Mika Singh career and assets: 
 Sawan mein lag gayi aag is no doubt his best compositions. So much so that the US musicians have made a remake of these songs, and it has reached worldwide. His Punjabi songs are still a sensation, and his music is grove worthy. He has given music in many movies, including Mauja hi Mauja from jab we met, Bas Ek King form Singh is king, Dhanno from Houseful, and so much more. He started his career from a very early age, and from that time, he has also produced a few solo albums that are a significant hit even today. Although there is not much news about him recently, we hope to hear his music soon enough. 
 Mika Singh family and relationships: 
 There is not much known about his family. He has not been very vocal about his family, and neither is much information available about them. He has landed in many controversies, however, regarding his personal life and his choices. We only know that he landed in a big controversy with his brother Diler Mehendi. We don’t hear much about the women he has dated, but there is a huge list of the women he has fallen in a controversy with. And there are rumours that he is dating Chahhat Khanna.
