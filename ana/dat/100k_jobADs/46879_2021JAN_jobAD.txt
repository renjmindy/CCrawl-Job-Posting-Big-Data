 #WhatIf: A Strange List of Jobs I Almost Had 
 By  Jess Witkins  on July 6, 2015 |  14 Comments 
 
 What if, in an alternate life, I was just like James Bond??? 
 Do you ever look back on your life and consider the alternate routes it could have taken? What would have happened if you'd said yes instead of no to a question? 
 Maybe I'd be living in a different city, maybe I'd have lost or gained significant friendships, maybe I'd be driving a luxury car,  and by luxury I mean one that came with cruise control â€¦ 
 I'm a storyteller and writer at heart. I often reflect on the choices one makes and the 'what if's' had the choice been different. After all, that's really just plot we're talking about. How will the world around you change by choosing x instead of y? 
 My day job is in the process of transition and it got me thinking about the many different transitions my career has had to date. If I ignore actual position titles, and go by the tasks I completed day to day, then I have worked in the following fields: 
 
 professional alphabetizer 
 storage room cleaner 
 napkin folder 
 duster of knick knacks 
 pizza maker and garbage taker-outer 
 gift wrapper 
 sales auditor 
 bra fitter 
 coach and counselor for commission sales team (AKA: the shark pit) 
 latte maker 
 social media guru 
 sex trivia host 
 
 And that got me thinking to what I _could 've _done in my career had a few application processes gone different. Imagine it, somewhere in an alternate universe, I am known as Jess Witkins: 
 
 district level lingerie manager 
 Catholic school secretary 
 organic farm office manager 
 grocery store deli worker 
 hotel night manager 
 bank teller 
 or if my father had his way, cake decorator - which  could  work if y'all are in the mood for an "abstract" trend in the bakery business. God, remember that time  I attempted to bake a tart ??! 
 
 I can't say I regret any of these "lost" positions. But I found it most entertaining to consider what life would have been like had Iâ€¦worked in close proximity with nuns or spent eight hours shaving a honeyed ham. 
 Life would be very different. I might even pick one of these faux jobs and use it as a writing prompt just for giggles. 
 What about you? What alternate life would you lead had a past job application worked out? 
Do we share a pension for habits and ham? ðŸ˜‰
