 The Original Jobyna 
 
 A tribute today to stage and screen actress  Jobyna Howland  (1880-1936) 
 Her unusual name was adapted from that of her father,  Joby "Happy" Howland , who'd gained fame as the Drummer Boy of Shiloh, the youngest enlistee in the Civil War (11 when he enrolled). She began her career as a model (she was one of the original  Gibson Girls ) and found her way to the Broadway stage by 1904. Her two dozen or so Broadway credits included parts in such shows as  McIntyre and Heath's   The Ham Tree  (1905), the first edition of  The Passing Show (1912),  Ruggles of Red Gap  (1915-1916), and the  Eddie Cantor  vehicle  Kid Boots  (1923-1925). Though she was beautiful, her height (six feet tall) caused her normally to be cast as mothers and dames ( Margaret Dumont  roles) even when she was quite young. 
 In 1918, she made her first film  Her Only Way  , with  Norma Talmadge . Only two more silent roles would follow; talkies would be much kinder to her. The silent screen's bigger Jobyna would be  Jobyna Ralston , leading lady for  Harold Lloyd  among others, whom, legend has it was named after Howland. Then, when sound came in, Ralston dropped out of films, and Howland became Hollywood's reigning Jobyna. She was a frequent foil to  Wheeler and Woolsey  (  The Cuckoos, Dixiana  and  Hook, Line and Sinker  , all 1930); was in the all star screen adaptation of  Kaufman  and  Hart's   Once in a Lifetime  (1932) with  Jack Oakie ,  Aline MacMahon ,  Zasu Pitts ,  Louise Fazenda , and  Gregory Ratoff ;  The Cohens and Kellys in Trouble  with  Charlie Murray  (1933), and the notorious pre-code bodice ripper  The Story of Temple Drake  (1933), written by  William Faulkner . She died suddenly at age 56 of what is believed to have been a heart attack. Her brother  Olin Howland  was also a stage and screen actor.
