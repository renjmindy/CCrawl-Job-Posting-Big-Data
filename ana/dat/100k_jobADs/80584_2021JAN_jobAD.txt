 Quartz.Net JobListener Example 
 Posted on  June 16, 2015  by  hammadk 
 Download Code - >  Quartz_Net_Example 
 JobListeners in Quartz.NET are kind of event listeners but in t his case they listen to the JOB. They are executed when the job is about to be executed or when the JOB has executed. The following is a simple C# Console Application that demonstrates the concept. The main JOB simply prints a msg that says "Hello, this message is from the JOB". The listeners also print messages to the console when the job is about to be executed and when the JOB has finished executing. 
 /* Example:     Job Listener in Quartz.NET
 * Explanation: Create a simple JOB that writes a text message to console application.
 *              Listens also print their message to console, before and after job execution.
 * Example by:  Hammad Khan
 * Copy Right:  You can use this program for tutorial and learning purposes. If you want copy it, please provide a linke to my blog http://www.hammadk.com
 *
