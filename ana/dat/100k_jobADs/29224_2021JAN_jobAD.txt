 Would you love the chance to work with autonomy to deliver a high level of quality that is critical to the future success of an established manufacturer of metal components distributing to a variety of industries? 
 Then you will be interested in my client, based in the West Midlands, who are searching for an experienced Quality Engineer to be responsible for driving forward a high-level of quality standards throughout the company. 
 Working in conjunction with one other Quality Engineer, you will be fully conversant in utilizing core quality tools/techniques such as PPAP's, FMEA's and ISIR to deliver robust quality measures that are crucial to the success of this fast-paced business. 
 Having invested a substantial amount of funds into the development of the site with plans to invest more in the immediate future, it was clear to me whilst walking round that this is a business with a clear cut forward vision who puts quality at the heart of everything they do. 
 With working experience of ISO 14001 Quality Management System and standards you will also need to work collaboratively with external auditing bodies to ensure compliance, and the continual maintenance and improvement of environmental standards for the business and its employees. 
 Championing any customer quality concerns will be paramount along with swift response to any non-conformance issues and the effective resolution of scrap and rejects in a timely manner. 
 The successful candidate will receive a competitive basic salary commensurate with experience. If you are interested in understanding more, get in touch with Elliot on 0121 752 9910 for more information and to run through the role in more detail. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
