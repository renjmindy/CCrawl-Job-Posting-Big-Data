 Give New Life to Your Walls with a Quick and Easy Paint Job 
 Posted on  January 25, 2014  by  Heidi Barker 
 Nothing helps to improve or even maintain the appearance of a room like paint. A fresh coat of paint can transform the entire look of your living space, or just cover up eye sores, like nail holes and wear marks from shelves, picture hangings or absent light fixtures. It can also add value to your property. 
 For do-it-yourselfers, there's almost nothing better to master than prepping for a paint job like a pro. Investing a little time in prep work can make painting faster, easier and more beautiful. So roll up your sleeves and find out how to avoid roller marks and spatters, and give new life to old walls. 
 Here’s What You Do: 
 
 Remove all artwork, shelving, fixtures, nails, screw anchors, curtain rods, switch-plates, closet doors and whatnot from the wall surface – anything that can create obstacles for your paintbrush, roller or  paint sprayer . 
 To remove wallpaper easily and completely , use a  wallpaper steamer . 
 Decorative stickers, vinyl words or wall art is usually removable. Use an  electric heat gun  to gently lift them from the wall. Some brands can be re-applied; however, many designs that use intricate graphics may be ruined by the removal process. 
 Spackle any nail holes, gouges or other imperfections that could rough up a smooth paint finish. 
 Hand-sand small rough spots with sandpaper. For larger rough areas, try an  electric sander . 
 Once the walls are bare, clean them with a damp sponge or a dry cloth to remove grease build-up, dust and the like. Dirt and grime on the wall will keep paint from bonding, causing streaks and bubbles. 
 Mask around windows, door frames, molding, built-ins and baseboards using blue painter's tape. If you have a decorative design in mind for your paint job, blue painter's tape is just the tool to use to map out the design on the wall. Tape out your design after you apply primer, if you use that step. 
 Cover the floor and any furniture remaining in the room with drop cloth. 
 Apply a primer to any sanded areas, especially larger ones, or simply prime the entire wall. Use a good-quality paintbrush to paint around windows and doors or for any finish work. Many paint brands now offer interior paint that includes a primer, which eliminates the need for a primer step. Either way, accomplish painting the larger areas quickly using a  paint sprayer . To accommodate the room height, add a  paint sprayer extension pole . 
 If a second coat of paint is required, apply after the first coat has dried. 
 
 
 Now that your room has a fresh coat of paint, consider adding other decorative elements like crown molding to complete the new look.

 A paint sprayer can save you plenty of time and labor when used correctly. Those who still work with brushes should buy one!
