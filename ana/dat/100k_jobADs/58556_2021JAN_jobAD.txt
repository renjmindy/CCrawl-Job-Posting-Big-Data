 Posted on  August 6, 2018  by  Working-Class Perspectives 
 When I graduated college in 1975, the U.S. was in the midst of a recession, and New York City was on the verge of bankruptcy. As a student, I’d commuted to Herbert Lehman College in the Bronx from my parents’ …  Continue reading ->

 Fractions within the Working Class 
 Posted on  March 13, 2017  by  Working-Class Perspectives 
 This has been a rough year. After the election, I reposted a few articles on my Facebook wall, as did so many of my friends, about the “working-class vote.” Did the white working-class just elect Trump? I didn’t think so, …  Continue reading ->

 Graduating College is Highly Overrated 
 Posted on  March 17, 2014  by  Working-Class Perspectives

 Posted on  February 18, 2013  by  Working-Class Perspectives

 Jobs and the “Fiscal Cliff” 
 Posted on  November 12, 2012  by  Working-Class Perspectives 
 My relief that Mitt Romney was not going to be our president, with a Republican Senate along with the House of Representatives, barely lasted through Tuesday night. By my lights, a lot of terrible stuff and a completely wrong direction …  Continue reading ->

 Education, Jobs, and Wages 
 Posted on  March 5, 2012  by  Working-Class Perspectives 
 Most people are surprised when I tell them that only about 30% of Americans over the age of 25 have bachelor’s degrees. This is especially true of professional middle-class folks who went to high schools where almost everybody went to …  Continue reading ->

 Mountains or Jobs: A False Question 
 Posted on  August 2, 2011  by  Working-Class Perspectives 
 In June, I was lucky enough to be among some 250 protestors who walked for five days from Marmet, West Virginia, fifty miles south to Blair Mountain. We traced the path coal miners had taken in 1921, which culminated in …  Continue reading ->

 Welcome to the Informal Economy 
 Posted on  May 23, 2011  by  Working-Class Perspectives 
 It’s graduation season, and while commencement speakers encourage graduates to work hard and pursue their dreams, most new grads are worried about finding a decent job. All their professors can suggest is that students use internships to gain valuable work …  Continue reading ->

 Who Creates Jobs? Taxes, Spending, and Class War 
 Posted on  August 16, 2010  by  Working-Class Perspectives
