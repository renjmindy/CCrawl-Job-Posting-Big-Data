 Postdoc position: “Tracing river carbon in marine sediments using organic proxies ”. 
 The Department of Marine Microbiology and Biogeochemistry (MMB) located at the Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ), is looking for a highly motivated postdoctoral researcher with a background in organic (bio)geochemistry and a keen interest in paleoclimate, biomarker lipids and analytical techniques. The position is offered for three years. 
 2020-12-17 14:56:41 
 LOCATION:                    NIOZ TEXEL 
 VACANCY NR.:               2020- 85 
 CLOSING DATE:            February 5th, 2021. 
 THE RESEARCH LOCATION 
 The NIOZ Department of Marine Microbiology and Biogeochemistry (MMB) studies microbial communities in all types of marine environments, from estuaries to the deep ocean. Using field and experimental approaches, we study the diversity, physiology and activity of eukaryotic phytoplankton (algae), prokaryotes (cyanobacteria, archaea and bacteria) and viruses in diverse marine environmental settings. We do so by a variety of analytical chemical, biochemical and modern genomic techniques. We use the lipids produced by micro-organisms to reconstruct environmental and climate parameters in the geological past, such as marine productivity and sea surface temperature. This is relevant for understanding the impact of mankind on our future oceans and climate. 
 The department is equipped with state-of-the-art laboratories, bioinformatics resources and analytical equipment, and has an excellent level of technical support. 
 The research is part of the Netherlands Earth System Science Center (NESSC), a virtual research centre comprising experts from the NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, Radboud University Nijmegen, Utrecht University, VU University Amsterdam and Wageningen University. NESSC brings scientists together with a background in physics, earth sciences, ecology and mathematics, in order to better understand the processes behind climate change and to improve future climate projections and predictions. 
 
 THE PROJECT 
 Constraining the input and burial of terrestrial carbon in the marine environment, both present and in the past, is important as marine sediments provide a long term sink for terrestrial carbon. Increasingly organic biomarkers representing organic matter derived from vegetation and soil organic carbon are used as proxies but no proxy exist for the organic carbon produced in rivers and lakes. Recently, the C32 1,15-diol has been shown to be predominantly made in river and lakes and is not detected in vegetation or soil while levels of the C32 1,15-diol in the marine environment are relatively low. In this project we are going to test this proxy both in marine coastal environments as well as on the continent and compare it with other terrestrial input proxies. The project will be in collaboration with the University of Utrecht. 
 THE CANDIDATES 
 We are looking for highly motivated postdoctoral researchers with a PhD and background in organic (bio)geochemistry willing to learn and apply cross-disciplinary approaches and work in a highly collaborative environment. Experience in the use of organic geochemical techniques such as UHPLC and GC in combination with (high resolution and/or isotope ratio) mass spectrometry, is required. Furthermore, the optimal candidate has a keen interest in developing new proxies and paleoclimate research, is a good team player and highly motivated to pursue new avenues of research. Due to the international character of our research, good command of English, spoken as well as written, is a prerequisite. We highly encourage applicants from all members of our community and of diverse background, including LGBT+ and BAME communities, to join us. 
 CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT 
 Employment of this position at Royal NIOZ is by  NWO  (The Netherlands Organization of Scientific Research). We offer a fulltime position for 3 years (fulltime) The salary is compliant to the  CAO-OI  (Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Research Institutes) scale 10 or 11 depending on your education and experience, a pension scheme, a holiday allowance of 8% of the gross annual salary, a year-end bonus of 8,3% of the gross annual salary, flexible work arrangements and 42 days of holiday leave (fulltime position). 
 You may expect attractive secondary employment conditions. We offer generous relocation expenses for employees coming from abroad and support with finding accommodation.
