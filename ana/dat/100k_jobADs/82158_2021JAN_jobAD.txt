 **On the Job Injury Attorney - Queens, NY ** 
 Workers’ compensation benefits are generally made available for employees who get injured on the job. As a result, your employer is essentially responsible for your medical bills that result from a work-related injury. The amount of benefits you are eligible to receive through the workers’ comp program depends on the severity of your injury and your ability to return to work. An experienced Queens, New York on the job injury attorney from  Polsky, Shouldice & Rosen, P.C.  can help you to better understand how this benefit program may apply to your situation specifically. 
 Medical Benefits Start Right Away 
 If you are injured on the job, you don’t need to file a worker’s comp claim before you receive treatment. In general, as soon as you are injured you should report the injury to your employer and seek medical treatment. If the injury is severe, take care of your health first, then report the injury. If you are concerned about retaliation or otherwise are apprehensive about reporting the injury, simply seek necessary medical treatment and then call a Queens, NY on the job injury attorney in regards to your reporting concerns and in order to file a workers’ compensation and/or personal injury claim as applicable to your situation. 
 Make sure to tell the doctor that you were injured at work. Your doctor can document the condition and how it happened at work. The billing can be sent to your employer’s insurance carrier or the employer directly. In many cases, the employer is responsible for paying for medical bills related to an injury that occurred at work, whether or not you have opened an active workers’ compensation claim. 
 Non-Medical Benefits 
 As part of the workers’ comp program, if you are unable to work or are permanently disabled, you may be able to receive benefits to cover your loss of work and loss of earning power. You may even be eligible to receive re-training in a vocational program. Generally, you will need to file a claim, with the assistance of a Queens, NY on the job injury attorney, in order to receive these non-medical benefits. 
 You will not receive benefits until the claim is approved or accepted. The benefits you receive will be conditional on your injury and condition. Your doctor may have to submit documentation stating that you are physically unable to work to be considered for non-medical benefits. 
 The insurance company can also deny a claim. If your claim is denied, you have the option to appeal that decision. An experienced Queens, NY on the job injury attorney can help you through that appeals process. You won’t receive benefits unless you win your appeal. Your workers’ comp benefits end when the employer shows that you can return to work or are no longer entitled to your benefits. 
 The time it takes for workers’ comp claims to be approved or denied will vary. Make sure to submit documentation and information to the insurance company so that it has the information it needs to adjudicate the claim. It can take a few days to review the claim and approve or deny it.
