 Why It's a Good Time to Relocate to Get Your Next Job.  Written by Hal M. Bundrick for MainStreet. Provides a good idea in a less than desirable job market.

Something to consider if you are looking for better employment. One thing to consider is if you do not have the means to relocate consider doing a phone interview if it is a job you are interested in.
