 Life Tip #26 
 May 18, 2019June 20, 2019  /  Kurt M Borne 
 Avoid the career of least resistance. Go for greatness! 
 Your career will likely consume upwards of ten hours a day, five days a week, for more than 30-40 years of your life, so strive for something you truly love. If you settle for the job or career of least resistance, you’ll never be fully satisfied and you’ll always wonder what could have been. 
 For twenty years I settled for the “good.” And probably every day during those 20 years, I wondered what could be. Finally, I got off my ass, stopped making excuses, and I’ve now started doing “what could be.” 
 You may have heard the story of Harland Sanders, a.k.a. Colonel Sanders, and how he didn’t open his first Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant until he was in his 60s. But you may not know that he ran a gamut of careers and jobs before that. He was a fireman for a railway, he practiced law, and he sold life insurance. He owned a ferry boat company, sold tires, and ran a gas station, all before starting to serve chicken dishes and other country meals. That sounds to me like a restless man who refused to settle for “good” and instead constantly pursued greatness. 
 By age 73, Colonel Sanders had more than 600 Kentucky Fried Chicken locations. How’s that for never settling for good enough, and not being afraid to seek greatness! 
 The lesson for us is to avoid staying in a job or field of work because, as we so often hear, “It’s all I know” or “I don’t know how to make the change” or “It’s too late to change now.” It is never too late to change direction. You just have to first gain the self-awareness to realize that you’ve been settling for less than your best, and then have the courage to try for greatness. 
 
_“I am only an average man but I work harder at it than the average man.” ~ Theodore Roosevelt_
