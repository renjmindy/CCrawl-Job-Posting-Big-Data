 Position Description 
 Assistant Teaching Professor in Mechanical Engineering 
The School of Engineering and Technology at the University of Washington Tacoma invites applications for a non-tenure track faculty position at the rank of Assistant Teaching Professor in Mechanical Engineering. This is a full-time position with a nine-month academic year appointment, beginning September 2021. 
 The Mechanical Engineering program in the School of Engineering and Technology is newly launched in Fall 2020. Successful candidates need to be prepared to teach a broad range of Mechanical Engineering courses including labs and senior capstone design projects. Priority topic areas include, but are not limited to mechatronics, robotics, controls, engineering design, machine design or manufacturing. Experience in curriculum development and elective course generation is a plus. While Assistant Teaching Professor primarily has a commitment for teaching and service, this position is also invited to participate in the wide range of research and scholarly activities. 
 UW Tacoma is a 46-acre, urban-serving campus that currently serves approximately 5400 students and is comprised of award-winning architectural LEED-certified, repurposed warehouses amid the city's museum mile. Situated on the high-technology corridor of Puget Sound, UW Tacoma offers views of the historic Foss Waterway and Mount Rainier, and provides a perfect gateway to the Pacific Northwest recreation opportunities. UW Tacoma's commitment to diversity is central to maintaining an atmosphere wherein students, staff, faculty, and residents find abundant opportunities for intellectual, personal, and professional growth. UW Tacoma faculty engage in teaching, research, and service and generally participate in lower, upper-division, and graduate instruction. The University of Washington Tacoma, one of three UW campuses, is an urban undergraduate and 
graduate-level campus that is changing the face of its region economically, culturally, and architecturally. 
 The School of Engineering and Technology (SET), formerly known as the Institute of Technology, was created in 2001 through a public/private partnership to address the critical industry demand for baccalaureate and graduate-level computing and engineering professionals. SET's 850+ students are currently enrolled in (i) four ABET-accredited undergraduate degree programs: Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering and Systems, Computer Science and Systems, and Information Technology, (ii) a Master of Science Degree in Computer Science and Systems, and a professional Master's Degree in Cybersecurity and Leadership, in partnership with UW Tacoma's Milgard School of Business, and (iii) Ph.D. program in Computer Science and Systems. SET will be expanding its degree offerings with state approved funding to start Civil Engineering in Autumn 2021. Our MS in Computer Science and Systems is also expanding by adding interdisciplinary, data-centric tracks that leverage the research strengths of other academic units on campus, particularly in Data Science, GIS, Bioinformatics, Cybersecurity, Distributed Systems, and Cyber-Physical Systems. New graduate programs under development include a MS in Electrical & Computer Engineering and a MS in Information Technology.
