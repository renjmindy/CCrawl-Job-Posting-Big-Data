 Dressing for Success with Grizzly Sales Force 
 Posted on  March 13, 2020  by  grizzlysalesforce 
 Welcome to interview season! As the weather warms up, so does the need for a new work opportunity. Our recruiting team here at  Grizzly Sales Force  is excited to begin meeting with qualified candidates over the upcoming weeks to fill a few of our open positions. Are you on our schedule? Congratulations! We understand that for many of you, this may be your first professional job interview. Our first bit of advice - prepare ahead of time. You don’t want nerves to get in the way! Secondly, dress for success! How you present yourself on this first face-to-face meeting can be the make or break on whether or not you land the job. To help you prepare, we are sharing three tips on how to dress business professional. 
 
 Dress for the job that you want, not the job that you have 
 
 Never worn a suit before? There is no better time than the present! You do not want to show up to a professional job interview dressed in jeans and a polo. We suggest a full suit for both men and women. Our team is not hiring based on a candidate’s fashion sense, but it is crucial for us to see if someone can confidently carry themselves. An interviewer will most likely make up their mind about whether they are interested in a candidate or not within the first five minutes. Make sure that they know that you are prepared in all aspects and that they can feel confident about your meeting with their clients! 
 
 Less is More 
 
 It can be so tempting to go all out when dressing for an interview. You want them to see you at your best; we get that! However, you don’t want the interviewer to be focused entirely on your outfit or your perfume and not on you. When picking a fragrance, go with something light. When choosing a shirt, think professional yet calm. You want your outfit to compliment your achievements and your personality. 
 
 Prepare Ahead of Time 
 
 Our last tip is all about preparation. Don’t wait until the last minute to get dressed. Have your outfit laid out a few days beforehand. This gives you plenty of time to get your suit dry cleaned and pressed if need be. On the morning of your interview, you should be focused on practicing common interview questions and doing last-minute research on the position. You should not be attempting to iron your shirt or pick out a belt. 
 Heading into an interview can be nerve-wracking. Hopefully, by following these steps, you will have plenty of time to dedicate yourself to mentally preparing. Here at  Grizzly Sales Force , we want all of our candidates to walk into our office with their best foot forward. We know that dressing business professional can be confusing, and we don’t want inexperience to stand in your way! Remember, show up in a clean, wrinkle-free suit with a smile on your face. We can hardly wait to meet with you and, hopefully, welcome you to our growing team!

 Theresa Salas Masters Recruiting and Motherhood 
 Posted on  November 21, 2019  by  grizzlysalesforce 
 Grizzly Sales Force  is celebrating the three-month anniversary of one of our incredible team members! Theresa Salas joined the team as a Human Resources and Recruiting Manager in August and has already created a strong record of success. We sat down with her this month to discuss exactly what it is that makes her such an amazing leader. We could tell you her story, but instead, we’ll let her take this one. 
 “I was born in Sacramento California and grew up in different parts of the state. Some of the most influential childhood experiences for me include learning how to save and invest, always being encouraged to try everything at least once, and never giving up on what I wanted to accomplish. Some of my fondest memories of my childhood include raising my first dog and training her to her full potential. I had a German Shepherd and she was the smartest dog I have ever come across. She knew all kinds of tricks from sit to play dead. I also always recall my father encouraging me to try new things at least once because you cannot say you don't like something if you've never tried it. These new activities with my dad included mountain biking, learning how to ride a motorcycle, learning how to ride a jet ski and of course, skiing in the snow! I was never too involved with sports at school, however, I did play tennis, volleyball, and kickball. I have always been a competitive person, but group sports definitely helped build the foundation for healthy competition, how to be a team player, and how to enjoy the wins big to small.” 
 Did you see yourself in this industry? 
 “I had no idea I would be in this field, but I ended up loving it! I have always had a strong background in customer service and the ambition to try something new, so it was all about finding a rhythm. My childhood dream job, because of my love for animals, was to be a veterinarian or to major in equine science, which deals with horses. My father was a police officer, so I always imagined combining our two careers and becoming an animal safety police officer. Now just having a dog is enough for me.” 
 Tell us about your college experience. 
 “I absolutely loved college! Human Anatomy and Math were my two favorite subjects, and I loved how the environment was independent and challenging. I always made it a goal to finish top in my class and help others understand concepts that might have not been clear. I plan on finishing my Bachelor's in business within the next year or so.” 
 Where did you work before joining the Grizzly  team? 
 “Before joining  Grizzly Sales Force,  I worked as an Inbound Sales and Relationship Manager at a Credit Union called First Tech in California. I absolutely loved this job because I got to solve Credit Union members' problems and give helpful financial tips on a daily basis.” 
 What is one life experience you feel has shaped you? 
 “One life experience that has helped shape me into the person I am today is having the privilege to travel to third world countries. Traveling to third world countries has made me a more humble and appreciative human being. I love being immersed in different lifestyles and cultures and wish everyone had this opportunity.” 
 What is something we might not know just by looking at you? 
 “Something you may not know just by looking at me is that I have a three-year-old daughter and I have traveled to more than seven countries.” 
 What do you consider to be your greatest skill? 
 “One of my greatest skills would have to be my ability to adapt and grow in any situation, I love figuring things out and being able to master anything new until the point where I can teach and influence others.” 
 What is the first thing you noticed about your company? 
 “The first thing I noticed at my office was the family office environment. I can honestly say we all treat each other with kindness and respect, but we are also about having fun and motivating one another.” 
 What are some of your best memories in the company? 
 “Recently, I was given an opportunity to join a leaders conference in Chicago. This was both empowering and inspirational because I got to see what growth and success look like in the office.” 
 What are the greatest challenges that you’ve dealt with in your work? 
 “The most challenging part of my workload is finding a good rhythm and balance. I have made a schedule that I still adjust now and then that designates times for making calls and scheduling potential new starts with the company. I have gained plenty of new experience in my role as a recruiter, and have learned how to better manage my time so that each minute at work is productive. Having the opportunity to meet so many new people has been my favorite aspect of the job.” 
 What are some of your proudest memories? 
 “One of the proudest moments in my life, besides watching my mini-me grow and learn every day, was graduating top of my class and delivering my graduation speech. At work, I have had the pleasure of receiving praise and acknowledgment for the hard work I do to help our company grow.” 
 What would you do if you won the lottery? 
 “If I won the lottery, I would probably buy my mother a brand-new house and help my family in any way possible. I would also travel to the rest of the places on my bucket list!” 
 When would you say you became an adult? 
 “I tell myself that I became an adult at the age of 15 because I moved out of my parents’ house and went to a different state to start a new life. If I could tell myself something at age 13, I would tell myself to enjoy being a kid and let adulthood run its course because it's inevitable. I would also encourage myself to be happy and enjoy the smallest pleasures in life.” 
 How do you define success? 
 “I define success as something that is achievable but is also revolving. You can be successful at many things, but life keeps going, so pocket that success and move towards greater successes.” 
 What are you passionate about? 
 “I am passionate about people, learning and teaching others. I love being able to explain how things work and I love helping others in any way that I can.” 
 What is the craziest thing you’ve ever done? 
 “I have done a lot of crazy things in my life, but the craziest thing so far would have to be learning how to ride a motorcycle in one day and then travel more than 600 miles on a road trip.” 
 What makes her work harder each day to achieve her goals? What keeps her moving during the slow days of life? For Theresa, it’s simple. “The main thing that motivates me each day to get out of bed and be the best human I can possibly be is not a thing but a person,” says Salas, “My sweet daughter, Persephonie Amia, is the best gift that I have ever received, and I am so blessed to be able to watch her learn and grow.”

 Meet Markus Pierce: Account Manager 
 Posted on  May 14, 2019  by  grizzlysalesforce 
 Welcome to  Grizzly Sales Force , where we value teamwork above all else. We would not have seen the great success we have reached today if it were not for the hard work and determination of our team. This month, we wanted to shine a spotlight on Markus Pierce, an account manager on our team. Pierce was born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee and has been in the business since October of 2017. 
 Pierce remembers his childhood as one filled with activity and excitement. “My parents would describe me as very outgoing and energetic,” says Pierce, “I was always looking for something to get into- good or bad. I always had a vision for being my own boss and even started selling snacks to other students in middle school.” The drive towards business is something that always existed in Pierce’s life, long before he earned the title of account manager. As a high school student, the achiever was involved in the Future Business Leaders of America. “Getting involved with FBLA exposed me to a business culture at the very beginning of my high school career,” says Pierce, “It helped influence the decision to take the entrepreneurial path. I always knew I wanted to start in sales and marketing because sales are everywhere. The world revolved around sales.” 
 After high school, Markus Pierce packed his bags and began his career at the early age of eighteen. “Moving to a whole new city at the age of eighteen taught me to be fully independent and changed my life.” 
 It wasn’t long ago that Pierce was walking through the  Grizzly Sales Force  for the first time. Since that day he has seen such great growth and has inspired us as his teammates. “My first thought when I joined the team was of the end goal,” says Pierce, “the merit-based business model caught my eye. When I learned that growth had nothing to do with age or experience, I was all in! Not only has this career grown me as a businessman, but it has enforced more discipline and structure into my personal life.” 
 As for the culture here at  Grizzly Sales Force , Pierce speaks with glowing reviews. “The family culture and strong team environment are what brought me into the business,” says Pierce, “to use one word- ecstatic! The energy and culture we have created have given us such a strong foundation. Every morning there are twenty or more people pushing me to hit my goals- that took my inspiration to a whole new level.” 
 “The number one lesson I have learned through my work is that any dream is possible as long as you have a support system. Being disciplined in what separates the successful from the unsuccessful.” 
 Despite the growth he has already found, Markus Pierce is only looking up. “My main goal is to be in a position to help others succeed and hit their personal goals. The people I grew up around tended to tear each other down, never building one another up. I want to be the person that changes the flow of things, the one that breaks the stereotypes.”

 Interview Do's and Don'ts 
 Posted on  July 21, 2018  by  grizzlysalesforce 
 Post-grad summer is coming to an end. We all know what that means. If you haven’t started already, it’s time for the job hunt. Fighting the slew of other applicants during this time can feel like swimming upstream, a never-ending battle with no sign of success. Feeling like you might start considering an unpaid internship? Don’t give up hope quite yet.  Grizzly Sales Force  is here to set you on the right track so that the next interview is the last interview. Follow these do’s and don’ts and watch how fast you nail that job. 
 
 Do dress your best. Nothing turns an interviewer off faster than an overly casual candidate. 
 Do arrive at least 10 minutes early, you’re not a burden. 
 Don’t overthink. You’ll put yourself at risk of sounding rehearsed. 
 Don’t seem distracted or disinterested. This may seem obvious, but sometimes anxiety and nerves can come off as disinterest- be careful. 
 Do your research and be prepared to talk specifics. 
 Do make small talk. An interview is about more than just the resume facts, they are looking for a fit for the company culture. 
 Do come prepared with a question. Almost every interview ends with “do you have any questions for me?” A prepared question shows a vested interest in the position and the company. 
 Don’t name drop. If you happen to know someone at the company, wait for it to come up naturally in conversation- chances are the interviewer already knows. For many, it comes off as tacky for a candidate to walk into the room and immediately and  unnaturally  mention someone who happens to work there. 
 Don’t trash talk your previous company. It is common for interviewers to ask a candidate what they did/didn’t like about their previous job. Of course, be honest, but there is a way to do that without being bitter or disrespectful. Instead of “my boss was a jerk,” maybe go for “there wasn’t strong communication between leadership and the rest of the team.” 
 Don’t people please. Trust us, we get it. When you want the job bad enough, you will say almost anything in an interview. However, the transition into the company will be much easier if you are honest about exactly who you are, and what you want out of a job. If the interviewer asks you if you know how to use photoshop, don’t say yes just to snag the job. Next thing you know, you’re sole task in the company is photoshop, now what? Be respectful, flexible, positive, but  honest . 
 
 You’re all set! You’ve got everything you need to impress that interviewee in a matter of 15 minutes. From all of us here at  Grizzly Sales Force , we wish you the best of luck.

 What Does Servant Leadership Mean To Us? 
 Posted on  June 12, 2018  by  grizzlysalesforce 
 Here at  Grizzly Sales Force , we have built a foundation from the concept of servant leadership, but what does this actually mean to us? To us this means accessibility. It means being available to you, anytime. We know that a strong leader is one that can be reached, and that is why we strive to always be just a call or click away. To us, servant leadership is always going above and beyond for our valued customers. We don’t settle for the bare minimum, and neither should you. We know you expect the most from us, because we expect that of ourselves. To us, servant leadership is unending creativity and a constant strive to reinvent and recreate. To be a servant leader is to be an unselfish leader, to put the needs of the team and the client before your own. This is what we strive for each and every day as members of the  Grizzly Sales Force  team. A comfort zone is foreign to us, we build our team from the bottom up to value creativity and authenticity. To us, servant leadership is trust. We know the value of your trust, and we do not take that for granted. 
 Servant leadership is more than ruling with an iron fist, to us it is teamwork. It means working together. We see the relationships that we foster with each other, and with you as a team effort, and a collaboration We strive every day to work harder to be more understanding, more collaborative, more flexible, more reliable, and more trustworthy. The basic factors that make a strong team are what we use as a foundation for strong leadership. After all, without a team, there is no leader. 
 We hope that you see this servant leadership in us with each interaction, as we strive to reflect these values each and every day. Every professional choice, business decision, and relationship we embark on is built upon this idea, with you in mind. 
 Along with our services, we promise to deliver the servant leadership we value so greatly. We work tirelessly to not only perfect our own leadership style but to inspire leadership in others. Here at  Grizzly Sales Force , the key to our strong team is this servant leadership within ourselves and among our teammates. It is our sincere hope that our pattern of servant leadership is not only reflected in our work day after day but will also inspire some leadership in you.

 How to Kickstart Your Career in Ten Minutes 
 Posted on  May 21, 2018  by  grizzlysalesforce 
 LinkedIn is a popular form of professional social media and online resume building, but the true muscle is in the myriad of hidden features. By taking advantage of everything the site has to offer, you can get a leg up on the job hunt in a matter of minutes. 
 
 Groups 
 
 Here at  Grizzly Sales Force , we know that the secret sauce of a strong professional network is exclusivity. Creating a group of people based on a shared professional interest can drastically boost your success on this platform and beyond. When considering your connections, i.e “1st level, 2nd level, 3rd.,” the power of the group is in the maximization. When posting about a job change, a job search, an accomplishment, etc. in the group, your announcement is boosted beyond those 1st level connections. 
 
 Publications 
 
 Are you an aspiring journalist? Highlight your work in the publications tab with direct links to your articles. Not to mention, this feature is apt for showing off social media management work through Instagram feeds or editorial blogs. Advertising your creative work in such a dynamic way will set you apart from the drab of bulleted links. 
 
 Connections @ Company 
 
 Congrats, you’ve found your dream company! LinkedIn has even done you the favor of showing you that you are a “perfect match” for this company, with all of the qualifications of a potential employee. The key to success after the first “congratulations!” notification, is forging deeper connections. Lucky for you, LinkedIn shows any and all connections you may have at the company for potential contact. Our advice here at  Grizzly Sales Force  is to take that gift and run with it. Contact those connections, because you never know will end up in your corner. 
 
 Career Advice 
 
 An overused piece of advice to students and young professionals is “find a mentor.” However, we know that is much easier said than done. With LinkedIn, the professional fantasy of a wiser, older guru with years of experience to help guide you through the trials and tribulations of your chosen career path is now a reality. By opting into the “Career Advice” feature, you are opening yourself to the opportunity to gain valuable advice from behind your screen. 
 
 “Get Introduced” 
 
 Looking for a way in? When you stumble upon a connection of a connection, you have the opportunity through LinkedIn to “Get Introduced Through a Connection.” Skip the uncomfortable, “Didn’t you work with her? Could you introduce me?” text. We think you should let LinkedIn do the dirty work for you. 
 In the modern digital age, much of the professional networking happens through social media, and the key to a successful career is harnessing that knowledge. Here at  Grizzly Sales Force  we feel confident that you too can harness this knowledge to transform your career in minute

I've even learned life lessons on how to apply a more positive attitude and be solution oriented. The CEO/President,  Mike Figueroa , has been an amazing role model as a hardworking, family-oriented man who always motivates me to be better and work harder. 
 
 Devonte - Junior, University of Memphis 
 
 Working at grizzly sales force is one of the best opportunities I have ever had. I work 3 days a week bringing home $800-$1000 checks. I get to conduct interviews with potential candidates.

 Leaving Behind an Empire: Account Manager Wil Skelton 
 Posted on  March 4, 2018  by  grizzlysalesforce 
   
   
   
   
   
 Individuals from all backgrounds, college degrees, and work experiences can excel in a career at  Grizzly Sales Force . Account Manager Wil Skelton is a prime example of this. Though he is a newer addition to our team, Wil has quickly made a name for himself in our company. 
 Describing himself as a "Mama's Boy", Wil grew up in Greenville, Mississippi as an only child. He has always been heavily involved in sports and loves being a part of a team environment. When Wil was younger, he mostly played basketball, baseball, and soccer. During high school, Will added track, football, and golf to that list. Helping his football team win the state championship in 2011 and his track team win it the following year, it is evident that Wil plays to win. 
 After high school, Wil attended Ole Miss as a Criminal Justice major but later transferred to Mississippi State University. Following in his father's footsteps, Wil changed his major to Mechanical Engineering, but he soon encountered the financial hardships that come with pursuing higher education. Wil decided that he would rather work hard for the money rather than to have it borrowed or given to him; he was determined to prove to others that he was capable of supporting himself. 
 Wil applied to many different companies online, including  Grizzly Sales Force . He received a call from our Human Resources Department and was offered the opportunity to interview here. He was open to moving out of Greenville, so he pursued the open position at Grizzly Sales Force in Memphis, TN. Wil enjoyed his preliminary interview with our CEO,  Mike Figueroa, Jr , and how Mike explained the opportunity: you get out exactly what you put in. Even though Wil had zero sales, customer service, or business experience, he proved to our management team at Grizzly Sales Force that he was willing to step outside his comfort zone, and he was determined to be his own boss and control his own destiny. 
 In just one month of working at  Grizzly Sales Force , Wil is rapidly advancing within our firm's Management Training Program. He was promoted from our entry-level position into an Account Management role within 2 weeks of starting here! Wil is currently learning the training process and is excited to start to move into a leadership role, where he will be teaching and developing others. When asked what he loves most about working with Grizzly Sales Force, Wil answered, "I love the work environment and the support from our team. It is impossible to have a bad day when everyone is so motivated and willing to help you succeed." 
 Why did Wil choose a career that was unrelated to his field of study? He liked that the advancement is based on performance; the harder you work, the quicker you move up. Wil wants to leave behind an empire, make an impression on others, and create a "chain reaction" of opportunity. The biggest lesson he has learned while working at  Grizzly Sales Force  to never lose your attitude. It is important to keep your energy level up because customers aren't going to want to talk to you if you're negative! 
 In his spare time, Wil enjoys playing sports-related video games, such NBA 2K and Madden. He also likes to play golf when the weather is nice. What you may not know about Wil is that he enjoys listening to Taylor Swift when he needs a good pick-me-up song! His greatest mentor is his Grandfather, describing him as responsible and good with money. "He's the type of person I want to be," says Wil. 
 Grizzly Sales Force  is incredibly proud to have Wil on its team. Finding an individual that has a tenacious work ethic and is willing to do whatever it takes to be successful can be rare, but we easily find this in Wil. We will leave you with one of Wil's favorite quotes by Kobe Bryant: 
 
 Those time when you get up early… those times when you stay up late… when you're too tired… you don't want to push yourself, but you do it anyway. That is actually the dream.

 Call it a Plan: Grizzly Sales Force's New Manager, Tandy 
 Posted on  December 28, 2017  by  grizzlysalesforce 
 
 “A goal without a plan is just a wish.” 
~Antoine de Saint-Exupéry 
 
 The culture at  Grizzly Sales Force  is often described as tight knit and unified. For family oriented individuals, such as our new manager, Tandy, this type of environment is a great fit both professionally and personally. During his time at Grizzly Sales Force, Tandy has demonstrated values such as unity and camaraderie - values that were instilled in him at a young age. 
 Born in the St. James Parish of Montego Bay, Jamaica, in a place called Barrett Town, Tandy has always been very close to his relatives. He grew up with a passion for drawing cartoons and scenery and a love for playing percussion instruments. Tandy even played drums for his church's band and his high school's band! While attending William Knibb Memorial High School, Tandy built picture frames and saving jars out of wood and then marketed and sold them to his peers, proving that he is an entrepreneur a heart! 
 In addition to his craftsmanship, Tandy was a track and field star, where he was mostly a dash runner because he loved to go fast and keep his eye on the prize! In addition to running, Tandy played soccer as a forward. His love for athletics would later become extremely useful in the development of his leadership and team building skills at  Grizzly Sales Force . 
 After finishing his senior year of high school, Tandy participated in the William Knibb Memorial's greater education program, where he studied architectural engineering for 2 years. He decided to leave school to run his own carpentry firm with his cousin. Tandy also obtained a job working for Delta airlines and balanced that job with his carpentry work; he worked for Delta during day and did carpentry at night for close to 3 years! 
 Tandy migrated to the United States in 2012 to Orlando, FL. He made a close friend quickly and the two of them ran a "Golden Crust" franchise, a restaurant that serves authentic Jamaican cuisine. During this time, Tandy was blessed with a beautiful baby girl named Robyn in 2014, who presently lives in Orlando with her mother. 
 Later that year in 2014, Tandy was presented with the opportunity to move to Nashville to partner with his brother and start a catering company named "Nashville Island Cuisine". For a few years, the brothers enjoyed running the company together, but ultimately, the business wasn't as profitable as they hoped. 
 Tandy began searching for new career opportunities outside of the food industry. In the summer of 2016, he came across a LinkedIn job posting for a private marketing and sales firm in Nashville. Tandy was intrigued by the opportunity and the merit based advancement structure; a career that emphasizes rewarding hard work was exactly what he was looking for! 
 Just a couple of months after Tandy started his new marketing and sales career in Nashville, news broke out that our client, DirecTV, would be expanding into Memphis. Our now CEO,  Mike Figueroa , would be overseeing the Memphis market and asked Tandy if he would be interested in moving to Memphis with him to open  Grizzly Sales Force . Tandy recalls, "Mike had open arms for a soldier like me, and I was down for whatever!" 
 Right away, Tandy fell in love with Memphis. Just 3 months after he started working in Memphis, Tandy reached the qualifications for Assistant Management! How did he do it so quickly? Tandy remembers, "I was very intentional about everything. I was a man on a mission. I believed in myself and my team." Tandy also had (and still has) a "vision mirror," where he writes down his goals on his bathroom mirror. Tandy laughs, "I like looking good, but I love seeing my goals even better!" 
 Now officially a manager within  Grizzly Sales Force , Tandy will be opening his own consulting firm in Grand Rapids, Michigan by late January, representing another multi-billion dollar telecommunications client. When Tandy received word that Grand Rapids was an open market for the client, Tandy checked it out, and he loved it! While visiting the area, he experienced the great culture and welcoming people of Grand Rapids! 
 Besides opening his new company, Tandy has plans to found a non-profit organization called "Fambily Guyz" - Fambily being the Jamaican word for Family. The organization will create healthier relationships in the household, especially for teenagers and their parents. Being the family oriented individual that Tandy is (he even calls himself a "Momma's Boy"), effective communication and strong relationships amongst family members are crucial for him. 
 Grizzly Sales Force  is incredibly proud of what Tandy has accomplished while working with our firm. Our team is excited to see his continued success running his own office in Grand Rapids. 2018 is YOUR year, Tandy!

 Grizzly Sales Force's Newest Assistant Manager: Ciarra Jones 
 Posted on  December 17, 2017  by  grizzlysalesforce 
 From the moment we met her, we knew Ciarra was special. It's no wonder that we are celebrating her promotion to Assistant Management just one year after her starting with  Grizzly Sales Force . It takes determination to excel within our company - a characteristic Ciarra has been developing her whole life. 
 Born and raised in Springfield, a small town outside of Nashville, Ciarra learned independence at a very young age. She played softball and basketball growing up and was in color guard throughout high school. Being the hard worker she is, Ciarra took her first job at age 15; she rolled newspapers for the Tennessean! Ciarra says that she has always been super outgoing and even won the “Social Butterfly” vote by her high school peers! During her senior year, Ciarra applied to Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) and was accepted into the Mass Communications program. 
 Ciarra had plans to leave her tiny hometown behind and attend MTSU straight out of high school. She learned quickly that things don’t always go according to plan when life threw her a curveball, and she found out that she was pregnant with her son, Jayden. Ciarra decided that she had to do what was best for her and her son by staying close to home. Still ambitious to get a higher education degree, Ciarra attended Volunteer State Community College where she received an Associates Degree in Dental Hygiene. 
 After working as a Dental Hygienist for a while, Ciarra realized that she “didn’t want to clean teeth for the rest of her life” and began to pursue other career options. She applied to many places online, one of them being a private marketing and sales firm in Nashville. She was extended several job offers, but this particular marketing and sales firm made the best first impression on her, and Ciarra firmly believes that “first impressions are everything.” 
 What she loved most about her new marketing and sales career was the positive environment and how it boosted her confidence tremendously. After working in Nashville for about a month, Ciarra was presented with the opportunity to become part of our client’s expansion into Memphis. Enter  Grizzly Sales Force . Our CEO,  Mike Figueroa Jr , was hopeful that Ciarra would move to Memphis to help him found Grizzly Sales Force. She didn’t have to think twice about the offer; Ciarra had always wanted to venture outside the Nashville area and live somewhere new! 
 Ciarra is more than satisfied with her decision to move to Memphis. Since working at Grizzly Sales Force, she has learned various leadership skills, such as how to deal with different types of people. Ciarra says that Grizzly Sales Force has also helped her grow personally, as she has learned to let her guard down and take emotion out of decision making. The biggest lesson Ciarra has learned is to believe in yourself and don’t be afraid of greatness 
 Ciarra’s pride and joy is her son, Jayden. She says, “He is my main source of motivation; everything I do and every sacrifice I make is for him.” Ciarra describes Jayden as incredibly smart, funny, loving, and energetic. Having her son at a young age, Ciarra and Jayden have always had a strong bond. Ciarra is committed to setting the best example for him and give him the greatest life possible. All of the hard work she is putting in now at  Grizzly Sales Force  is so she and Jayden can have financial freedom and the freedom to go anywhere and do anything they desire. 
 How did Ciarra reach the qualifications for Assistant Management? She feels very fortunate to have so many mentors at Grizzly Sales Force. She says that Mike believed in her from the day she stepped into the office in Nashville, and has never stopped. Ciarra describes our other Assistant Manager, Tandy, as “The Ying to her Yang”. She says that Corporate Trainers Michael, Robert, and Kiki are her cheerleader, her right hand guy, and her “executioner” - respectively. Ciarra says, "My team doesn’t work for me; I work for them. I put them in the position to win, set them up for success, and remind them to never give up." 
 Stay tuned for pictures from Ciarra's Assistant Management Promotion party coming out this week on our  YouTube  channel!
