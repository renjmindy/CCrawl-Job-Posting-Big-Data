 Johnny Depp is best known for portraying the loveable-yet-dastardly Captain Jack Sparrow in  Disney ’s Pirates of the Caribbean. Over the past two decades, the Pirates films have created a multi-billion dollar franchise, with no small thanks to Depp. 2020 saw the star appearing at a UK high court to take on a British tabloid, who accused the Hollywood star of being a “wife-beater” towards his ex-wife, Amber Heard. 
 Shortly after this court case came to a close, Depp was dropped from his role in the long-running Fantastic Beasts franchise. 
 This was no small feat, as Depp played the main antagonist in the films, Gellert Grindelwald. 
 The latest reports coming from noted Hollywood insiders suggest Depp is going to be changing how he is working in the coming years. 
 According to Daniel Richtman, Depp is reportedly looking at starring in a number of “smaller projects” going forward.

 The Academy Award nominated star is best known for his huge blockbusters, including the aforementioned Pirates of the Caribbean, and Fantastic Beasts, but also the likes of Edward Scissorhands, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. 
 But this apparent shift in Depp’s career could change the way viewers see him on the big screen. 
 Depp last starred in some smaller-budget films during the beginning of his career, in such titles as Private Resort, and Arizona Dream. 
 More recently, Depp appeared in 2016’s Yoga Hosers, and the 2014 sci-fi movie Transcendence. 
 Shortly after Depp’s court case against Heard and the tabloid, he was asked to leave the role of Grindelwald by Warner Bros. 
 Speaking about the situation in his own words, he posted a lengthy explanation on his Instagram account, which read: “In light of recent events, I would like to make the following short statement. Firstly, I'd like to thank everybody who has gifted me with their support and loyalty. 
 “I have been humbled and moved by your many messages of love and concern, particularly over the last few days. Secondly, I wish to let you know that I have been asked to resign by Warner Bros. from my role as Grindelwald in Fantastic Beasts and I have respected and agreed to that request. 
 “Finally, I wish to say this. The surreal judgement of the court in the U.K. will not change my fight to tell the truth, and I confirm that I plan to appeal. My resolve remains strong and I intend to prove that the allegations against me are false. My life and career will not be defined by this moment in time.”

 The 57-year-old has not yet been officially removed from the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, but many Hollywood rumours have reported that he will not be returning. 
 In early 2020 it was suggested that Harley Quinn star Margot Robbie would become the new face of the upcoming Pirates reboot. 
 This rumour was inadvertently confirmed by Robbie herself in November of 2020, when she  commented on the upcoming project in an interview . 
 The Wolf of Wall Street actor explained that the new version of the series will feature a lot of “girl power”. 
 The reboot is due to be written by Christina Hodson, who also penned the Birds of Prey movie. 
 On working with her pal, Robbie added: “It’s too early to talk about it… I love Christina, obviously. 
 “I’m not a producer on Pirates, so I’ll sit back and kind of wait for the process. We’re really, really excited at the prospect of adding obviously a very key female element to that world.” 
 The Pirates of the Caribbean films are available on Disney Plus  now.
