 Adzuna is a job search engine that lists every job, everywhere. From launch in the UK in 2011, we now have tens of millions of visitors a month and are busy conquering the world from our office in West London, helping millions of people find better, more fulfilling jobs. 
 The role: 
 Adzuna's success to date has been down to the skills, hard work and determination of the brilliant people we have hired. Right now, we're seeking an ambitious Strategy Manager to work directly with our CEO Doug Monro (ex Bain, eBay, Gumtree and Zoopla) across growth, strategy, planning and M&A projects internally and externally. This is an incredible opportunity to be in the room when the important stuff happens and while there will be some analytical, project management and 'get stuff done' tasks alongside the strategic stuff, you can be sure you will learn a ton. 
 You'll be working alongside Doug, his co-founder Andrew, and key people like our CCO James (ex Google/Airbnb) and Head of Finance Martin. We'll benefit from your strategy, finance, consulting or tech experience to date but even more important is the passion you bring to work every day. You will strive for excellence, be keen to learn and try new things, inspire and engage those around you and feel ownership of overall company success as well as pride in doing your bit. 
 What 's in it for you? 
 Adzuna is a growing scale-up, championing real change in the job market globally - using the power of tech to match people to better, more fulfilling jobs. We're at a really pivotal time in our journey and it's an exciting moment to join. We're growing rapidly in the US in particular on the back of cutting-edge programmatic technology, expanding our labour market data offerings and growing year on year (and hiring!) despite COVID-19. 
 Like everyone here, you will act like an owner, be a team player and make a difference. It's an opportunity to work with a smart team led by experienced management and dedicated and passionate Founders. You have the chance to own your and the company's growth in terms of: 
 
 Running & improving our annual/quarterly/weekly goals and planning processes 
 Identifying M&A targets and executing deals where relevant 
 Identifying and getting involved in new business lines, strategic partnerships and growth initiatives 
 Helping with strategy, financing/exit, Board communications and metrics 
 Developing internal excellence around analytics, presentations etc 
 Learning how to grow a scale-up, across commercial and product areas, with the potential to own a P&L or roadmap in the future 
 
 We want to realise the next level of success and you will utilise your own skills and experience across analytics, strategic thinking and project management to meet our goals. 
 It's not an easy feat, but our aim is to create a business of which we are all proud and an environment where you will love to be, where you can be yourself to do what you do best. 
 About you: 
 We don't like to put people in boxes, but you're likely to be able to demonstrate experience of, or aptitude for much of the below: 
 
 Demonstrable experience (minimum of 3 years) working in an area like strategy consulting, corporate finance or a strategy function in a relevant industry (like tech, media, recruitment or consumer goods) 
 Strong numerical/analytical skills 
 Able to build complex excel models and create compelling powerpoint slides 
 Strong work ethic, drive and passion to get things done, even with limited resources 
 Entrepreneurial, practical attitude to solving problems or growing a business 
 Good written and verbal communicator and able to establish strong relationships at all levels, internally and externally 
 Well organised, detail oriented and able to project manage and prioritise multiple projects; happy to get hands dirty and juggle! 
 High level of integrity/discretion around confidential projects/deals 
 
 It's a bonus if you have: 
 
 Worked in a tech startup before 
 Exposure to or an interest in any of: search engines, marketplaces, recruitment or online ad models; product management or tech; sales; online marketing 
 Exposure to M&A or corporate finance processes 
 Experience of dealing with legal documents like NDAs or contracts 
 Pitching or negotiation skills 
 An MBA from a well rated school 
 
 Benefits: 
 
 **Reward:  **We offer a competitive financial package which includes competitive salary, stock options, a contributory pension scheme and Perks at Work. 
 Wellbeing:   We take the wellbeing of our employees seriously and have taken every step possible to protect the health and wellbeing of our people during COVID-19. Amongst other things, we offer healthcare through Babylon Health, access to free counselling and a programme of wellbeing activities and events. We have a flexible working policy and during COVID-19, for the foreseeable, no one is expected back in the office unless they choose to attend. We also run regular wellbeing workshops, offer enhanced maternity and paternity leave, and 25 days paid holiday per year 
 Training:   Through our Adzuna Academy training programme, attending conferences, team training budgets, individual development plans and coaching from experienced and supportive peers and managers. 
 Fun stuff:   An environment that is thoughtfully designed to allow for work and play including (when we're not restricted by COVID-19) a roof terrace, bar and table tennis. We have a packed social calendar, twice annual global team get-togethers and an enviable culture thanks to the amazing and smart people who make Adzuna a great place to work. Much of this is all done remotely at the moment of course - even during COVID-19 we are still managing to have a lot of fun 'together' thanks to our great Social Committee.
