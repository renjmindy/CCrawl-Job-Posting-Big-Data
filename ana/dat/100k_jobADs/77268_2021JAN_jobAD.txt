 Kanye West Gives Himself An Interesting Dye Job 
 The first sign of a celebrity really losing it is doing some shit to their hair, right? I am mostly thinking of Britney when she shaved her head, but I feel like it is a sign of some sort. 
 Kanye  is currently rocking this snow cone looking hair. I mean, it's definitely different. He added some orange and pink to the bleached hair already. 
 Kanye wants to be Sisqo so bad. 
 Do you love or hate the hair?
