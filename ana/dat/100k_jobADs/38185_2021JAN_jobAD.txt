 "That is what Roman Abramovich will say, 'you've spent over £200m on such a strikeforce'. 
 "Yes, we know they need time to settle, but the hierarchy there won't feel like that. They will say, 'if he doesn't finish in the top four, he will not have a job.' Simple as that." 
 Sherwood added: "You can tell he keeps looking at the big screens and seeing his face on it, he knows he's under pressure. 
 "When you feel that camera on you, you know the highlight is on you. 
 "He should be under pressure because he spent the money. When you spend money, unfortunately as a manager it heaps the pressure on you."
