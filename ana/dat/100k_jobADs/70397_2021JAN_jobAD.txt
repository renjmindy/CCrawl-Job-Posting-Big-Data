 Eduardo Mayon, 
 If you have worked already in Israel, it would be difficult if not impossible to go back because Israeli government has a cap on how long foreign caregivers can work, usually no more than five years and three months, unless a caregiver is found indispensable especially by the very old, very sick, or disabled employers. 
 Thanks for visiting Caregiver Work Abroad.
