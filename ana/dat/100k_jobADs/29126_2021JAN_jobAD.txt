 Product Details 
 Tingley Shirts: Job Sight Class 3 Men's High Vis Lime S76522 Long-Sleeve Sportsman Shirt 
 Safety is an extremely important part of your job description. You face certain dangers on a daily basis, but it's all part of the day's duties. Fortunately for you, workwear has been made to help prevent you from harm. This ~Tingley Job Sight Class 3 Men's High Vis Lime S76522 Long-Sleeve Sportsman Shirt is made for you. 
 Tingley manufactures this product with your welfare and functionality in the workplace in mind. To keep you from injury, this high visibility shirt is made in fluorescent yellow-green background material for excellent daytime visibility. It features 2-inch silver reflective tape that will reflect light for 360° nighttime conspicuity. This product meets the American National Standard for High-Visibility Safety Apparel and Accessories (ANSI/ISEA 107) standard for security on the job site. More specifically, this Tingley men's lime shirt qualifies as a Type R garment, meaning it meets the standard for protection of roadway workers and those who operate equipment and machinery. Furthermore, this long-sleeve sportsman shirt is a Class 3 item, which further defines the minimum amounts of reflective and background material needed for the item to meet the standard. Class 3 requires the most reflective and background materials. Overall, this product is ANSI/ISEA 107 Type R Class 3 compliant in order to give high visibility, ensuring a greater level of protection for you. 
 However, hazardous conditions can also come from above you. To guard your skin from the sun's heat and harmful rays, this long-sleeve high visibility work shirt is made from lightweight 75 denier polyester accredited with boosting comfortability and flexibility in high temperatures. The material is extremely breathable and is meant to be worn by laborers in warmer climates or those who are exposed to heat for lengthy periods of time. The back of the product is fully-vented, while the sides and chest feature vents for improved air circulation. It also includes partially segmented Sawtooth™ reflective tape, which allows for breathability and reduced heat stress. It features a fold-up expandable collar to keep your neck safe from the sun. 
 But this Tingley Job Sight Class 3 shirt is made for more than just keeping you safe. It's functional, too. It includes two patch pockets with hook-and-loop closures for proper storage of your items. It also has an additional pen pocket on the left of the chest, providing your prized writing utensil a designated location. The long sleeves each have a button closure on the cuffs for a secure fit. While this item is long-sleeved, it has the option of being rolled to the elbow and locked into place for your personal preference. 
 So if you’re looking for men's high visibility workwear that’s functional and safe, you can’t go wrong with this Tingley Job Sight Class 3 Men's High Vis Lime S76522 Long-Sleeve Sportsman Shirt from Working Person's Store. The bright color with reflective taping makes sure you're more visibility at the workplace, and the lightweight design with a full-vented cape back with side vents all help you stay cool and comfortable, too.
