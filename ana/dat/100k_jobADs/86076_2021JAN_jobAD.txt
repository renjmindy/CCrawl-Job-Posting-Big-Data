 day 2281 - general practitioner

 my family doctor never seems to fail at disappointing me. i went into her office for one reason - to get either an xray or mri referral. i didn't get either of the said referrals. instead, i got a prescribed topical cream. this blows my mind that one needs to go through medical school to be able to tell me topical cream will be the best relief she can provide. remind me to never go to her unless i want to get disappointed
