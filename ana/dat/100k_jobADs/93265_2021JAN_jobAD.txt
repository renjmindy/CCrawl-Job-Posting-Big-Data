 How should an employer respond to job site accidents? 
 Running a company comes with a wide set of responsibilities, and one responsibility that should never be ignored is your employees' safety at the job site. Although you and your employees will take a lot of precautions, there are still risks of job sites accidents. The most common job site accidents include slip and fall injuries, vehicle injuries, repetitive motion injuries and machine entanglement. As an employer, the first thing you need to do if any of your employees are injured at the job site is to provide immediate medical attention. Once you provide them with the medical assistance, it is time to provide them with support if they are seeking worker compensation. You must co-operate with them if they are hiring an attorney to seek the right compensation.
