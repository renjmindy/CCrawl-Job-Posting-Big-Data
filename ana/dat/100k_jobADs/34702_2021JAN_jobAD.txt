 Scams 
 
 Craigslist - Writers needed to produce quality content (from your dining room table) 
 
 SCAM  Email: gbartlett@ec.rr.com (George Bartlett) 
 SCAM  Email Response Text: Sounds like this could be a perfect fit for you. This link will take you to a 25 min flash presentation that explains how your talent for writing could create some additional income…or a LOT of additional income. 
 SCAM  Site:  http://www.19103465384.info 
 SCAM type  -  This person is recruiting for a pyramid scheme and fishing for free content.   If you see this posting on Craigslist,  flag it  to prevent these scammers from taking in new freelancers. 
 
 Craigslist - Writer's Needed Now (Paid Training) (Winston-Salem and everywhere around) 
 
 SCAM  Email: byronrisdon@gmail.com ( Byron Risdon ) 
 SCAM  Email Response Text: I would like to speak with your regarding the position. Please feel free to contact me at  646-922-4177  or leave your number and best time to reach you and I'll give you a call. 
 SCAM  Site:  http://www.BridgeMedia.com 
 SCAM type  -  This site/person is fishing for free content.  They expect 3 full length articles before payment will be issued, and claims that if even a single person in their supposedly 20+ person team (which are not in contact with each other) turns in work late, no one can be paid that week and everyone needs to wait a week or more for pay.  If you see this posting on Craigslist,  flag it  to prevent these scammers from taking in new freelancers.
