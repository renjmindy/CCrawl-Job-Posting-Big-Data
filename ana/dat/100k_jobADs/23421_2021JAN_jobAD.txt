 If you love learning, tackling tough problems and working with great people, this could be for you. 
 Role overview 
 How youâ€™ll make a huge impact here - and for your career: 
 Youâ€™ll be able to work on a product, AdvocateHub, that 8 of the top 10 software companies in the world use today to build communities that deliver efficient revenue growth, activating users and mobilizing advocates to power their growth. In short, weâ€™re a passionate team working hard to build the best customer marketing and advocacy product in the world. 
 Software and tech debt go hand in hand, thatâ€™s why we have a third of our teams investing in our platform to make life easier for developers. Youâ€™ll also have two days a month to invest in problems you think are worth solving. So if you love learning, tackling tough problems and working with great people, this could be for you. 
 Our Technology: 
 Our core product is written in Ruby on Rails, weâ€™ve created dozens of other services to support our scale as well as speed up our delivery schedule. While we use ruby on rails to serve our apis and store our data, our frontend application is a rich web app built with modern reactjs with a focus on functional and declarative programming. Weâ€™re currently in a big push to embrace graphql and expand our usage of typed data. If youâ€™ve ever wanted to get away from the imperative style so often found in javascript codebases, you may find our tech stack particularly interesting. We use the ramdajs functional library everywhere, Gulio Cantiâ€™s tcomb for typing, and weâ€™re exploring typescript and algebraic data types for future projects. 
 We make extensive use of AWS, Docker, Postgres, Mongo, ElasticSearch, Drools, Memcached and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like GitLab CI to streamline our deployments and tools like Datadog to see whatâ€™s going on under the hood. In addition, we are a big fan of Terraform and in the process of automating all the things! 
 What an incredible candidate looks like: 
 React experience 
 
 At least 2 years experience creating dynamic applications using ReactJS 
 Up to date knowledge of the React ecosystem, including suspense, hooks etc. 
 Familiarity with graphql and apollo 
 Experience building/using component libraries 
 Experience with css-in-js, EmotionCss in particular 
 Bonus points for integrating react with legacy codebases (backbone/rails) 
 
 General Javascript experience: 
 
 Knowledge of modern build tools, processors, bundles 
 Familiarity writing and maintaining internal nodejs tooling/scripting 
 Fully comfortable with npm, Babel, webpack. 
 
 General 
 
 Very comfortable in bash/zsh/fish/your shell of choice 
 Familiarity with Docker 
 Resourceful and collaborative, able to act as a mentor to other developers, and want to help those around you succeed. At times, acting as a lead for other developers to complete larger projects 
 You donâ€™t shy away from detective work and problem solving (even when the answer isnâ€™t obvious); finding a solution to a problem excites you. 
 Comfortable and willing to spread your knowledge throughout the team 
 Last but not least, youâ€™ve got a documentation mindset 
 
 What youâ€™ll get from us: 
 At Influitive, youâ€™ll find an empowering environment where people are inspired to do great work, learning and developing quickly as professionals as they fundamentally change the way modern businesses operate. (Check out our Glassdoor page to see what this looks like in action in the words of our advocates â€“ our employees.) We offer competitive compensation and stock options in the company. Hungry and want to truly feel your impact while working with an amazing team of people? This is the place for you. 
 At Influitive, we believe that diverse and open teams perform the best. 
 Fostering an inclusive environment where we can learn and grow from each othersâ€™ perspectives is an important element of our growing family. Influitive welcomes and encourages people from all backgrounds, abilities, experiences and perspectives to apply to join our team. We are committed to being an equal opportunity employer, and are happy to provide accommodations upon request at all stages of the interview process.
