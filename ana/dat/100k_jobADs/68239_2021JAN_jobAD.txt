 Practice "Perfect Practice" 
 Mar  3 
 ~ an excerpt from  **  Millionaire Secrets In You ** 
 
 In today’s demanding society, people are constantly striving to be the best that they can be. After all, in order to land the perfect job or get the things that you want in life, you have to be able to excel and take on the role of a go-getter. How do you get to the level where you would like to be? Anyone will tell you that it will take hard work, a lot of determination and loads of practice! 
 “They say that nobody is perfect.   Then they tell you practice makes perfect. 
_I wish they 'd make up their minds.” _ ~ Winston Churchill 
 If you always do what you’ve done, you’ll always get what you got. Any professional athlete, actor, celebrity, public speaker, etc. will tell you that to achieve an extremely high level of success you need to practice. Michael Jordan is considered by many to be the greatest basketball player of all time, Jerry Rice holds just about all the receiving records in the NFL, both men have been known to practice to improve their skills more than anyone else in their sports. And this holds true and consistent with any great success in any business or industry. You simply can’t achieve a level of success without practice. 
 “My father taught me that the only way you   can make good at anything is to practice, 
 and then practice some more.”   ~ Pete Rose 
 Nobody ever wakes up knowing how to play classical music on the piano. Learning an instrument is just one example of how practice can get you further and further toward your desired result. In order to get to the success level that you would like, be it an instrument, sport, salesperson or speaker it is important to set goals for yourself and take the time to practice until you get better and better. While you are learning, it is imperative that you are able to take constructive criticism and feedback on how you are doing from your mentor and coaches or even your peers and clients. 
 There will be a number of things in your life where you will only attain greatness as long as you practice. Whether you are looking to master a sport, give an amazing presentation or be an outstanding salesperson, there is nothing better than buckling down and practicing. 
 Half of the battle in this lifetime will be realizing that nobody is perfect. While you may be able to achieve a perfect score on a test or you may find the perfect house to live in, there are many more things out there that will get better with a little bit of practice. If you look at your area of business, there is always room for improvement. Why would you want to be perfect anyhow? It would seem as though perfection would be a little bit boring and lonely. After all, when you are perfect, you have nothing left to strive for, right? 
 They always say that practice makes perfect, when in reality practice only makes you want to practice more and more. And it’s not just practice, it’s  perfect practice  that makes the difference. Simply logging time does not cut it. While it may seem to be a daunting task to practice something repeatedly, you must keep your eye on the prize at all times in order to keep things in perspective. 
 “I know you 've heard it a thousand times before. 
 But it 's true – hard work pays off. 
 If you want to be good, you have to   practice, practice, practice. 
 If you don 't love something, then don't do it.” 
 ~ Ray Bradbury 
 Think about it …  repetition is the mother of skill; it’s the key to learning or improving on anything, so practice,  perfect practice!
