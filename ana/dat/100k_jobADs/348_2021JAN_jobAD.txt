  Applying For An Out Of State Job  
 Robin Schlinger 
 November 03, 2013 
 Your job search might alert you to opportunities far from your hometown. While you are willing to relocate, many companies are hesitant to interview, let alone hire, out-of-state applicants. 
 
 Applying For An Out Of State Job 
 If you want to relocate out-of-state or away from your hometown, realize many companies will not pay for relocation in the current economic environment unless they cannot find a local candidate. Here are a few techniques you can use to increase your chances for an out-of-state job: 
 
 Find a mailbox company (or a friend) with an address perceived as within the commuting distance for the job. Also, get a phone number (use Skype or Google Voice) to get a phone number that is in the area code where the job is. 
 In the cover letter, mention although you are currently working in another city, you have begun the transition to the new location. This is true if you have established an address and phone number in the new city. 
 I do not recommend that your resume list name, email address and phone number only. That bare-bones information can get you eliminated from the application, since the company will assume you are hiding something. 
 In the cover letter or email that accompanies your resume mention that you are open to relocation. Even better, if you already have plans in place to move to the state, let the company know when you will be a resident. 
 The easier you make your relocation for the company involved, the more likely they will be to consider you. You may want to consider paying for your own transportation to the interview. 
 
 Of course, the most important consideration is your resume and cover letter highlight the skills, accomplishments and experience that companies in your target state are looking for.  Enjoy this article? You've got time for another! Check out these related articles:
