 Good job Google+ and YouTube integration! 
 Posted on  September 27, 2012September 27, 2012  by  jonchui 
 For the longest time, I've always felt the collaboration between Google products was a bit, let's say rough. 
 So you can imagine how I was super impressed this morning w/ Google, when i logged into my YouTube account, was met with this: 
 (EDIT: the original image i copied into wordpress, but wordpress did not upload it and instead returned a blank image.. so i found one online to use from Ron http://ronangelo.com/your-full-name-on-youtube/ - thanks ron) 
 It always felt a little awkward signing into youtube with my Google account, but still using my old youtube username (chewchewchewtrain - don't ask) 
 I can't get over how clear it is what is going on - I knew the second i saw it, without even reading the specifics, what was happening. For those who don't, they can read the details in text a little more. 
 I also like how they easily allow you NOT to user your full name, since I can see a lot of people wanting to stick to their old YouTube username which they have become known for. I, however, don't mind confusing the 1 or 2 people who follow my youtube account by linking it to my Google+ profile 
 Clicking Next, I got the 2 of 3 steps (again, very clear from the design of the top heading). 
 Look how great the red circles & arrows are @ distinguishing what specifically will change on your appearance. bonus points for using an actual video i uploaded!

 Jon Chui (pronounced "chew") has been building iOS/Android apps for the last 7 years, the last 3 working on Google Maps, Inbox by Gmail and Google's Search App. Though he grew up in a Christian family and to parents who would end up giving up their 25 years of hard-earned comforts/affluence in Canada to go back to China as missionaries when he was 14, being a Christian was always in his head, and he would constantly struggle with trying to unify the sacred and the secular - until last year. However, through a radical transformation[https://jonchui.wordpress.com/2016/05/17/a-copy-of-my-last-email-before-leaving-google/] @ work last year (which he can't take ANY credit for), he & his wife & 2 young boys have decided to leave Google, sell/donate everything they have so to serve the poor & marginalized with Jesus’ love as missionaries with YWAM.org's Family DTS in Kona, hawaii then to the Philippines.
