 Job Description 
 Your vibe and experience 
 While previous experience working in food service or retail as a barista, server, sales associate, cashier, team member, or customer sales representative is always helpful and appreciated, what is most important is who you are. 
 You are trustworthy and have trust in others. You find joy in the details and believe good quality is what keeps guests coming back. You remain cool, calm and collected in a fast-paced environment. You understand there is no “I” in team and thrive in social situations. You’re always willing to learn and grow. You get that service isn’t a transaction, it’s about connection. That a smile can make all the difference in someone’s day. It’s genuine, and it’s who you are.

 Greeting guests, taking orders and processing payments 
Preparing fries and drinks 
Managing delivery and mobile orders 
Assembling orders and packaging take-out and delivery 
Keeping all surfaces clean and sanitary to ensure the safety for our guests, fellow crew members, and yourself 
 Whether working at the front counter or in the Drive-Thru, you are a part of a dynamic team that works together to deliver an exceptional guest experience.
