 By Workopolis 
 Looking for a hot, high paying job for which they’re hiring right now? We’ve got a list of ‘em. 
 Workopolis' own  recent analysis  of requirements listed in job descriptions found that most of the skills trending upwards for demand indicate increased hiring in the Technology, Healthcare, and Data Analytics sectors. And  Glassdoor’s latest list  of the 25 highest-paying jobs that are in demand, “identifying top jobs that pay the most and are in high demand by employers nationwide,” bears this out, as a majority of the positions are in the tech and healthcare sectors – with some finance, law, and a couple of other things thrown in for good measure. Also, I would have expected Data Scientist to be considerably higher on the list. 
 Most of these positions will come as no surprise as they all require higher levels of education and experience–  Oh really? Physicians and lawyers make a lot of money!? Excuse me while I keel over from not surprise  – but some of the jobs are more easily accessible options than others. And it’s nice to see marketing managers getting a shout out. 
 Note that “nationwide” in this case means the U.S., but the Canadian market is often comparable. Also, the salaries listed are reported by Glassdoor users and are not based on government or other gathered information.
