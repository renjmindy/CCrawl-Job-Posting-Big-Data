 LABOURER JOBS 
 ​OVERVIEW: 
 Labourer jobs are predominantly found in the building and construction industries. Labourers perform manual tasks such as digging trenches, unloading building materials and preparing job sites. They use a range of hand and power tools in their duties, and are also expected to operate and clean heavy machinery. 
 When assisting qualified tradespeople such as bricklayers, plumbers and landscapers, labourers often develop expertise in these areas. Experienced workers are called on to perform routine labourer jobs and skilled tasks as needed. 
 Most labourer jobs are outdoors and involve early start and finish times. Labourers may be required to work with dangerous materials such as lead, asbestos and chemicals. Certification is usually needed for these jobs. 
 General skills required for labourer jobs are: 
 
 
 A high level of physical fitness 
 
 
 Strength to lift heavy objects 
 
 
 Ability to read technical plans and drawings
