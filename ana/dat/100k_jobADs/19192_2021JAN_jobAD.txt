 Organising your arse and getting serious about your business! 
 Being a creative nerd I've never had a head for business or even considered anything I do  as  being a business and I know I'm not alone in that thinking. 
 
 Last year I took a deep breath and followed Lady Gaga and "jumped in at the deep end" by opening my first  Etsy Shop  -  Sophie 's Artisan Arts . It was terrifying and exhilarating, and while I haven't exactly set the world alight, I have had a solid first year, helped no end by my incredibly awesome and supportive friends - THANK YOU!!!! ‚ù§ ‚ù§ ‚ù§ 
 **I admit I always thought that creativity and business weren 't harmonious bedfellows. **But anyone creative who needs or wants to make a viable career from doing what they love (whether it's writing, art, design, making crafts, photography etc etc), needs to develop a  head for business. 
 
 Trust me, nothing makes me squirm more than the thought of dull accountants, business records, paperwork, profit margins, checklists etc etc., to me those are the antithesis of living a spontaneous and creatively fulfilled life.  It 's just not how my brain works! üòÄ 
 But in simple terms, if you love what you do and you want to make a  sustainable  and  consistently reliable  living from what you do, then you need to sell what you create/make and that means developing a business brain and  a strategy to help you achieve your goals. 
 Once you've realised this, then the next step is working out how the hell you go about doing that, especially when your chosen field is absolutely swamped by thousands of others doing what you do or something very similar (though no doubt to a poorer standard). üòâ 
 
 Standing out from the crowd is the obvious first step, but to do that not only must the product you create be  original  and  brilliantly created  (quality NOT quantity - sadly so often talent only gets you so far and not to the winning post), but you need to  market it  expertly, get people to take notice of it and you.  You need to approach what you do as a business not a hobby. 
 If people don 't know about the amazing things you create how can you sell any of them and make a successful business? 
 It's the difference between being an amateur hobbyist and someone who is a professional in their field and is  serious  about pursuing their dream of making a career and a whole life based around what they love to do. 
 Not approaching your creative life seriously is a massive obstacle to your success, so snap out of it! 
 After a long chat with my fellow arty mate, Linda (and fellow giggly work colleague), where we discussed business plans and what we hoped to achieve this year and in the future, I followed Linda's advice by getting the  Maker 's Yearbook 2019 , by  Nicola Taylor  , a goal setting workbook and planner  specifically for artists, makers and handmade business owners. 
 
 WOW!!!! MIND BLOWN! üòÄ 
 Unfortunately I was too late to get the book which sold out, so I bought the PDF version and printed it off at home on 120gsm quality paper and popped it in a folder. I'd never heard of this Maker's Yearbook before and even though I didn't purchase it until halfway through January, I've been addicted to it ever since! 
 For a scatterbrain like me, who has all the  business acumen  and ICT proficiency of a fish on a bicycle, this has helped me no end! 
 I cannot recommend this enough. It breaks everything down into  small achievable goals  , so straight from the beginning you're achieving something  positive  and  succeeding rather than failing . It helps you to structure your business, your thinking, to get you to  work more effectively  and  efficiently  rather than just working harder and chasing your own tail while making no actual forward progress and burning yourself out. It makes you review the previous year (2018) and really identify what worked, what didn't, what mistakes you made, what expenses and costs you had, what money and actual profits you made and how you divided your time between actually doing the creative thing you love and just flitting around like a headless chicken trying to gain attention in the hope of some sales. 
 It was a very interesting and reflective exercise. It made me realise how terrible my time keeping is, how unbalanced my life is, how disorganised and chaotic I am, how exhausted I've been and ground down, and how little progress I made, despite all my efforts, compared to the previous year (2017). 
 What a jolt to the senses! 
 Already, at the end of this first month (after only 2 weeks of having this Maker's Yearbook), I have already booked an Art/Craft fair for March, have contacted numerous art centres, shops, exhibitions etc,. will be meeting the head of an art centre next week and have a  clear plan  and  strategy about the year ahead  - something I've  NEVER  had! 
 
 The moment I finish the long term map commission I've been working on for far too long, then the rest of my plans will start to kick in. For possibly the first time in my life, I actually feel that my creative life  can  actually have a viable commercial/business future and I actually  will  be able to make a career from doing what I love. It's very early days, but finally‚Ä¶  I HAVE A PLAN!!!! üòÄ 
 So to all my creative buddies out there trying to live off the thing you create, many of you struggling as I have, some of you on the brink of giving up while others are enjoying successes, **DON 'T GIVE UP **or  GIVE IN . 
 
 KEEP GOING  , get yourself organised, set yourself real weekly and daily goals which all take you one step further to achieving your overall aim and  GO FOR IT! 
 No-one can climb a mountain in one go, you start by climbing a low foothill first. Get that first achievement under your belt then move on and the same applies here. 
 Is it easy? Of course not, nothing important ever is. For me personally, one of my  biggest challenges  is overcoming my  social anxieties  and  crippling self-doubts . This goes WAY beyond  ' imposter syndrome'  for me, this is more like paralysing fears, actually having to winkle myself out of my hermit hole and converse with actual real human beings, having to cold call places, put myself forward, try to exude confidence while my nervous sweats start in. 
 
 People that don't know me well imagine I'm the height of confidence, the big bubbly girl, but I'm collapsing inside. Yes I know I have some measure of artistic talent, I could always draw and paint better than most of my friends even from an early age, but I am NOT a professional at  networking  ,  marketing  , at  selling my products  to the actual public. Just doing one Art Fair last year showed me just how out of my depth I was. To me it seemed that everyone knew what they were doing, these were people who had been setting up stalls and selling their goods for years and had it down to a fine art. Their tables were eye catching and professional looking, they had  prints of all their work  so even if a customer can't fork out a large amount for something they'll still buy something small for ¬£4, ie. they still make a sale and the stall exudes success which draws more people in. It was both awe inspiring and utterly terrifying! 
 
 Any introvert will know what I'm talking about. You just want to shrink into the background or hide under your tablecloth, but you have to sell yourself and your work and do both justice - so no, it's definitely NOT easy, but like most things, it is a skill you can learn and improve on with practice. ‚ù§ 
 After all, we learn from failure and success. 
 Wishing you all the very best for 2019, may it make our dreams and goals come true!
