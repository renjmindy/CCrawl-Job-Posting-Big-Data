 Job Confirmation by SMS

 Get confirmation for received jobs 
 One of the most frequent requests we get from Workiz users is a better way to confirm communication with the field staff. 
 “How can we know if the tech actually got the job?” 
 A simple way to do this is with our two-way messaging interface and incoming job notifications. 
 Another way to be sure your tech got the job is with a confirmation link within the SMS message. 
 This means every job sent from the job page to a technician will include a short confirmation link that looks something like this: 
 We tried to keep the link as short as possible so that the message would pass as a standard SMS, and that the link would be identifiable to most smartphones. 
 Now you can see if the job was received without checking your messages within your dashboard, or from the job page itself.
