 Not surprisingly, this holiday season, online sales are expected to hit all new levels. Accordingly, many companies are geared up for seasonal staff. 
 Best part? Many of these positions are remote/work from home! 
 Take a look at some of the great work at home opportunities below: 
 1. Amazon 
 Sometimes, Amazon has virtual (or "work-from-home") positions available to qualified individuals who live in some areas. So if you aren't near a physical Amazon location, or just want to see if there are virtual opportunities in your area, you're in the right place. 
 Simply visit their site via the link below and filter to 'seasonal' to find these jobs.

 3. Amazon Flex 
 Own a reliable car? You may be able to make money delivering packages for Amazon!

 What is Amazon Flex you ask? It’s simple: You use your own vehicle to deliver packages for Amazon as a way of earning extra money to move you closer to your goals.
