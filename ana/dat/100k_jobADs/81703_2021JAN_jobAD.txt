 From Hobby to Career – Becoming a Vintage Seller 
 In the second of my two posts for  Shurgard 's blog, I am asking: so, you think you have a good eye for 
vintage clothing and accessories? Perhaps, after many years devoted 
to your own collection – honing your eye for a bargain – you 
realise you prefer hunting down vintage and antiques more than your 
actual job. Well… why not try and make a living out of your hobby? 
Seriously! You'll have to get used to early mornings, become a 
photographer, get to grips with social media marketing and, most 
importantly of all, genuinely have a passion for what you're doing. 
But the rewards are so worth it!

 Keep your eyes peeled 
 The casual collector scours eBay and 
Etsy and probably frequents vintage sales, charity shops and 
carboots. But the serious stock sourcer needs to think bigger. You 
can find big lots on eBay if you look, but it's being first through 
the door at sales of all kinds that reaps the rewards. Pro sellers 
are the ones lining up at opening time, sweeping through and leaving 
before the hobbyists have even got out of bed! You can even try going 
to proper vintage clothing auction houses like  Kerry 
Taylor  to battle it out with other dealers, 
hitting foreign flea markets or making friends with local house 
clearance companies.

 **Promoting your collection  ** 
 When you've acquired some stock, what 
then? Sure, you can book spots at fairs, boot sales and so forth, but if you don't have transport, it can be difficult. Selling online is the answer, but it's an art all in itself. Taking decent photos is 
key. A decent camera (or cameraphone), a plain backdrop (or 
bedsheet!) and a cheap mini tripod are good to have. It's definitely 
fair to say that the better your photos are, the more you are likely 
to sell, and potentially command higher prices. 
 
 Butch Wax on Etsy 
 For clothing, you can model the pieces 
yourself (check out  Butch Wax 
Vintage , who has mastered pinning larger pieces 
on herself) or use other models (see  Atypical 
Girl  who does both), or get an adjustable 
mannequin (like  Advantage 
in Vintage ). Making sure everything is 
ironed/steamed (the latter is so much quicker) is crucial! With 
jewellery, an uncluttered background is good. You don't need to 
invest in expensive light boxes, you can  DIY 
these things with a bit of effort! Whatever you are selling, you need 
to go over each piece with a fine-toothed comb to make note of any 
flaws. Fix, sew and clean anything you can yourself!

 Social media is key 
 Mastering social media is the next step 
to selling world domination! Have an Instagram, Facebook and Twitter 
account so that whatever your customers' preferred platform, they can 
follow you. Even if you aren't a big user of all three, you can use 
many great automation tools to take the hard work out. Check out 
 IFTTT  , 
 Buffer 
and  Schedugram  , 
and if you're not a natural social media addict, spend half an hour a 
day and schedule your updates, then you won't have to be a slave to 
it the rest of the time. Plus, you can use Instagram to sell direct, with no fees or on Facebook groups like Ooh La La Vintage Swap & Sell, as mentioned in  my last post . 
 
 Making space 
 Finally, in order to stop your new job 
and supersized collection taking over your life, especially if you 
wear vintage yourself, consider hiring some external storage. Even if 
you have space at home, it can be useful to keep your work separate 
and your spare room, you know, spare. Better than sticking your 
precious things in a damp loft or an unsecured outhouse, professional 
storage places like  Shurgard  are completely safe, with PIN entry & 
24-hour CCTV coverage. Plus, they offer the flexibility to store 
things for the short or long term, perfect for when you're just 
starting out as a vintage seller and you're still working out which 
sales methods or events are going to be the best for you. 
 Good luck!
