 COVID RESOURCES FOR JOB SEEKERS AND BUSINESSES 
 Workforce Center Services 
 A pandemic like COVID-19 has profound impacts on our workers and businesses, so we must come together to support those who may lose their jobs and employers whose companies will be impacted. 
 Since March 23, 2020, our career centers have closed to the public for in-person services and we have been serving you by phone, email, and other virtual means. However, we recognize that there is an increased need and urgency for employment services  . Beginning June 1, 2020, we will open our centers for appointments only.  Please contact any of the workforce centers below, or your case manager, to schedule an appointment. 
 What to expect when you arrive for your appointment: 
 • All clients will undergo a quick “contactless” temperature check and be asked a few brief questions about your potential exposure to COVID-19. 
 • All clients will be required to wear a mask/mouth covering (like a bandana or scarf). If you do not have a mask, we will have disposable masks for your use. 
 • All clients will be asked to observe social distancing of 6 feet between themselves and anyone else in the center. 
 • We encourage clients to wash their hands and/or use the hand sanitizer provided in the centers both before and after your visit. 
 •  If you are found to have a fever of 100.4 degrees or above, refuse to answer the brief questions about exposure or be found to have potential exposure based on your answers, OR refuse to wear a mask, you will not be allowed to remain in the workforce center – but we can serve you in many other ways.   Please leave us your name, phone or email so that we may continue to serve you virtually at a later time. 
 Our career centers are continuing to take every possible measure to shift many of our previously in-person services to remote, and many resources can still be accessed over the phone, via email or online. All in-person large group meetings or events, including workshops, orientations, and hiring events, are on hold until further notice. However, we will be rolling out a variety of virtual orientations, workshops, and hiring events in May 2020 to serve you better. Please follow us on social media to stay up to date on announcements about those new virtual meetings and events. 
 For more information, connect with your local center, or if already enrolled in our programs, contact your career advisor directly. If you cannot reach someone, please leave a message or email. 
 All messages will be returned as soon as possible.

 Unemployed Due to COVID?

 For comprehensive guidance and resources about state benefits related to employment and COVID-19, we highly recommend this FAQ page from KDOL:  www.dol.ks.gov/covid19response . You can file a claim online at  www.getkansasbenefits.gov   or file by phone at (800) 292-6333. Please understand that at this time, customers are currently experiencing very long wait times on the phone. We encourage your patience and recommend filing online, if possible.

 Other Resources 
 The U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) published its first round of implementation guidance according to the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA). The guidance addresses critical questions such as: 
 • How does an employer count its number of employees to determine coverage? 
• How can small businesses obtain an exemption? 
• How does an employer count hours for part-time employees? 
• How does an employer calculate wages employees are entitled to under the FFCRA? 
 The initial WHD guidance is available in three-parts:
