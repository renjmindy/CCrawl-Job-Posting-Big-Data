 Potential Job 
 I have a new potential job, at least short-term (I tried to do a US President joke here, but it was too silly and obvious to be worth it). The friend who recommended me for the job I had in January has now offered me some more work in the same institution. This would not be library work (unlike the January job), but admin work, but hopefully within my ability. It's likely to be for a couple of months over the winter, two days a week, so I can still do my volunteering, apply for future jobs and work on my novel on other days. I would be classified as a key worker, although I don't want to say why because to explain would compromise my anonymity, but this would mean I would be allowed to go into town to work. I could potentially do some of the work remotely, but at least initially I would have to go in to learn what I'm doing. This would mean travelling on the Tube during lockdown, which I'm a bit apprehensive about. But otherwise it's good news. 
 Having been there before, there's less "new situation" autism anxiety and I know some of the people already, and in any case not that many people will be around with lockdown in effect. I do worry about alienating a friend if I make mistakes or am generally inefficient though. 
 
 I volunteered this morning. I was a few minutes late, partly because when I woke up I felt dizzy and had to sit down for a few minutes. I also hurt my back while I was volunteering. Volunteering involves moving heavy boxes of tinned and boxed food and bending down to put tins and boxes into bags, so maybe this was not surprising. I am somewhat nervous about continuing to volunteer, as the bus I travel on has a lot of schoolchildren, not all of whom wear masks (to be fair, most do, which impressed me) and it is hard to social distance. However, they need the volunteers, and now it looks like I'll be travelling on the Tube some days, it seems silly not to volunteer as well. 
 
 Having watched the first two TV series of  Twin Peaks  , I watched the prequel film  Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me . I'm not sure what I think of it exactly. According to Wikipedia (because I'm autistic and read up on any TV series or book that interests me), most critics hated it on release, but it's had some recent positive reassessment. I think I need to process it. 
 It was rather bleaker than the previous TV episodes (although the original run had ended very bleakly), albeit with a kind of redemptive ending. To be honest, it was 18 rated and I worried that I would find it too gory and unpleasant. I didn't (apparently I have a higher tolerance of gore than I thought, although there were a couple of moments when I looked away), but I think I was on edge the whole time and didn't really get into the mood of the piece. I had left the lights on; I usually watch TV in semi-darkness for atmosphere, but I wanted to stop myself getting sucked too far in and then frightened or disgusted. 
 I felt it avoided the prequel trap of just ticking boxes to get the characters to the point where the original story started. I mean, it  did  that, but it did more than that, in a way that I felt the  Babylon 5  prequel did not. I was probably prepared, from reading reviews, for the fact that the film contained little of the humour that lightened the bleakness of the TV series. I think it will need another viewing (now I know where the scary and gory bits are) for me to really 'get' it. It seemed like the early episodes of  Twin Peaks  , which I found better than the later ones, unsurprisingly given the return of David Lynch as co-writer and director. 
 OK, enough  Twin Peaks  , this isn't a  Twin Peaks  blog! 
 
 Other than that, not a lot happened. I volunteered, I got exhausted, came home, had the sudden interruption of the job offer, then watched  Twin Peaks  and listened to some online  shiurim  (religious classes). Now I'm very tired and headed to bed.

 That's good news about the potential job! (And I chuckled at the US president non-joke)

 Yay! Congratulations! I will keep hoping for a sudden interruption job offer to come my way too.

 That's wonderful news! It sounds like an ideal amount of time. Although I'm retired, I would enjoy doing a couple days of volunteer work-but not during a pandemic.(at my age)

 Yes, a pandemic isn't the best time for volunteer work.

 Is the volunteering through a Jewish org?

 Yes, but I don't want to say which one here for anonymity reasons.

 Congratulations! I hope it goes well and that your worries get alleviated ‚ù§ Kudos on your volunteering, I honestly can't do physical labour, so I mostly volunteer in other capacities. You're right to be cautious about public transport and unmasked commuters.

 Thanks! I'm even worried about masked commuters, as I'm still not sure that masks are a full-proof way of stopping transmission, although obviously they're better than nothing.

 It's definitely not full proof but cuts down the risks significantly.

 Personally I still don't like crowding, even with everyone masked, but people are less keen to keep 1 meter apart these days.

 Oh, OK, that's good to know when I'm struggling with wearing mine! 
 Crowding is difficult, yes.
