 Craft CMS developer with design chops REMOTECONTRACT 
 Job Description 
 I have a client that I built a site on Craft with, but the person that I work with (as a designer and programmer) now has a full-time job and can no longer work with me on the site. This client's website (pdkpoll.org) needs yearly updates and changes that need to be made. It's not a big client and they're a non-profit so they don't pay a ton, but I need someone to partner with to do the design and Craft CMS work with me (I'm the account lead/client manager/project manager/UX/content person -- you know your usual very small agency stuff). If you're interested, please reach out. Thanks!
