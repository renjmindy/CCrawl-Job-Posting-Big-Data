 Compensate is a nonprofit on a mission to combat climate change by offering people ways to compensate for the emissions of everyday life, and thus creating possibilities for a carbon negative life. The foundation directs the compensation payments in full to purchase certified carbon credits in order to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Currently we are focusing on building different software solutions to make compensating a frictionless process regardless of context. APIs and plugins for eCommerce platforms to enable voluntary compensation of purchases, self-checkout solution for businesses to compensate for operational emissions, and a mobile app to help individuals compensate and make more sustainable choices, are just a few of our projects that we're either working on or soon starting. And we're definitely not stopping there. Making use of mostly open-source technologies, our technical roadmap includes novel approaches, such as data lakes to feed machine learning solutions, building a knowledge graph of carbon emissions, and event-driven solutions. If you are interested in how we approach carbon compensation and our standards beyond just international certificates, you can take a look at this blog for more info: https://compensate.com/articles/changes-to-compensates-project-portfolio-international-standards-were-not Compensate is committed to bringing together individuals from different backgrounds and perspectives. We strive to create an inclusive environment where everyone can thrive, feel a sense of belonging, and do amazing work together. Weâ€™re looking for talented individuals who want to roll up their sleeves and join us in providing solutions to mitigate climate change. If youâ€™re a kind, passionate, collaborative problem-solver and are looking for a new opportunity to make a difference, join us!
