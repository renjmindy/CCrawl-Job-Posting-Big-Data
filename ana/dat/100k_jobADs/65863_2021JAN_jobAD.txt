 English Language Teacher Jobs in China 
 You want to  teach English for one year in China ? We arrange your job as an English teacher at private English schools and public primary schools. This is even possible as a non-native speaker.  Shorter durations (from 1 month; minimum age 18 years) are possible as a part-time English teacher.

 Many parents in China want to offer their children foreign language classes in addition to the English lessons at the regular school. We work with several chains of private language schools, offering such classes. In total, they have several hundred branches. 
 English is taught in a fun and playful environment and teaching aids such as interactive games on a large touch screen, movies and animations are used. There are regular fun activities and competitions. 
 The exact class times depend on the school and are usually in the afternoons and on the weekends. Many private English schools are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays and open on Saturdays and Sundays instead. 
 During your first week, you will work with an experienced English teacher and observe the class. The school provides you with teaching materials so you can plan your lessons. About once a month there are network meetings where you can meet experienced teachers to get additional advice. 
 English language teacher jobs are available for both native English speakers and non-native speakers. If you are non-native speaker, you will need to have a TEFL certificate (or equivalent or higher English teacher qualification) to participate.  You can get the TEFL certification online in around 2-3 weeks for around 180 EUR/200 USD. 
 English language teacher jobs are remunerated. The exact amount of compensation depends on the language school and your qualifications and ranges from RMB 8,000-14,000 per month (around EUR 1000-1700 / USD 1200-2000 per month). 
 Due to visa requirements, it is necessary that you sign up for a full year, hold a BA degree that you completed at least 2 years ago, and that you are 24 years or older.

 As an alternative to private English schools, where classes are usually held in the afternoon or on weekends, you can also teach at state elementary schools. Classes take place during normal school hours and English is one of the regular school subjects. Typically, there are about 25-30 children in a class. Teaching materials will be provided to you by the school. 
 English language teacher jobs are available for both native English speakers and non-native speakers. If you are non-native speaker, you will need to have a TEFL certificate (or equivalent or higher English teacher qualification) to participate. You can get the TEFL certification online in around 2-3 weeks for around 180 EUR/200 USD. 
 The salary is about 5000 RMB (630 EUR/730 USD) per month. Usually, no salary is paid during school holidays. 
 Due to visa requirements, it is necessary that you sign up for a full year, hold a BA degree that you completed at least 2 years ago, and that you are 24 years or older. 
 Part-time jobs as a language teacher for English, Spanish, Japanese, Italian and German (from 1 month, from 18 years) 
 In Beijing, we can arrange part-time positions at language schools as English, German, Japanese, Spanish and Italian language teachers. You should be native speaker and have a relatively dialect/accent-free pronunciation of the respective language. A formal qualification is not necessary and you do not have to have a BA degree or work experience. You will be paid around 200 RMB per hour and you would typically work for 10-20 hours per week. The number of weekly hours is however not guaranteed in advance, but depends on how well the students and school rate your teaching skills. It can also be more than 20 hours. This position is possible from a minimum duration of 1 month and is available for applicants from 18 years of age. 
 Steps: 
 1. You email us your CV/resume in English, along with a recent photo. This is without any obligation for you. If you have formal qualifications in language teaching, please include scans of the same. 
 2. You share with us your Skype username, on which Alex, our coordinator in Beijing will to talk to you and then contact language schools. 
 3. The school will then interview you via Skype and provide the exact conditions report (content, scope of work, etc.). 
 4. If the school agrees to hire you and you agree to the conditions, you confirm your participation. It only becomes binding for you from this step.
