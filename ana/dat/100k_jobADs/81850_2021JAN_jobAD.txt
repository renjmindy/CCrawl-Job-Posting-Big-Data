 Medieval Occupations and Careers 
 I came a cross a great source of medieval professions, careers and titles is from the page:  What did people do: in a Medieval City? 
 If you are hunting for updates to the list, or have questions check out all their good work. 
 
 Governmental Occupations 
 These are the people who run things. They keep society moving smoothly, if they're good at what they do, and can bring society to a crunching halt, if they're not. Rife for corruption, government officials can play a significant role in many campaigns. 
 
 bailiff  - the man who makes arrests and executions. Bailiff was not primarily used for the office of policeman. Etymologically, bailiffs were those in charge of the bailey - in effect, manager of the craftsmen and servants in a castle or manor house. 
 catchpole  - literally 'chicken catcher', one who finds and brings in debtors. 
 chancellor  - a secretary to a noble or royal 
 constable  - the warden of a town or castle 
 diplomat  - the person who negotiates with foreign nations 
 emperor  - the ruler of an empire 
 exchequer  - the man responsible for the king's revenue 
 hayward  - an officer in charge of fences and hedges 
 herald  - had two responsibilities: a man in charge of making pronouncements and proclamations, and one who is an expert in the field of heraldry (the various insignias used by the rich to identify themselves.) These two responsibilities were one in the same. Medieval Europeans wouldn't have thought it possible to separate them; much less would they have considered them separate roles. 
 jailer  - the man responsible for a jail: he keeps the criminals from getting out 
 judge  - a man who is responsible for deciding questions brought to court 
 king  - ruler of a kingdom 
 knight 
 lady 
 liner  - an officer in charge of tracing property boundaries in the city 
 master of the revels  - official in charge of court entertainment, and later of the theaters [note: the first Master of the Revels was not appointed until Henry VII in the 15th century] 
 nobleman 
 prince 
 pursuivant  - officer of arms, ranks below herald, similar duties 
 reeve  - church warden. Note that the word 'reeve' applies to much more than the Church. Reeves usually came out to be combination administrators and business managers of estates, towns and small territories (i.e. shires) - something like a chief bailiff. 
 sherrif 
 summoner  - officer of the court who serves subpoenas (see also  religious version ) 
 watchman 
 woodward  - the keeper of a forest 
 
 Military Occupations 
 Who keeps the country safe from encroaching enemies and wild monsters? Why, the military, of course. These brave men - and sometimes women train against the possibility that they'll have to protect their country with their lives. 
 
 Arbalestier  - one who fires an arbalest (a type of metal crossbow) 
 archer  - one who shoots arrows 
 bowman 
 camp follower  - people following an army, making money off of the soldiers 
 cannoneer 
 crossbowman 
 drummer 
 engineer 
 guardsman 
 halberdier 
 Knifeman  - one skilled with a knife; specifically, a soldier trained to disembowel horses 
 mercenary 
 pikeman 
 pioneer  - an early term for military engineer 
 sapper  - specialist in field fortifications 
 scout 
 siege engineer 
 sergeant 
 sergeant-at-arms 
 spearman 
 spy 
 
 Criminal Occupations 
 Wherever there is society, there are criminals. These occupations include only the so-called "professional criminal": it ignores those people who are corrupt at every level of society who has a legal "front", from kings to beggars. 
 
 boothaler  - marauder, plunderer 
 burglar  - one who breaks into, and steals things from, other people's houses. (If you break into and steal stuff from your  own  house, you're just a nut.) 
 diver  -  fig.  a pickpocket 
 fence  - one who trades in stolen goods 
 footpad  - one who robs pedestrians 
 outlaw  - a man wanted by the law 
 pickpocket  - one who picks pockets 
 poacher  - one who illegally kills animals, usually on somebody else's land 
 silk-snatcher  - one who steals bonnets 
 stewsman  - probably a brothel keeper - "since the words stew and stewholder both mean a bawd, I'm guessing that a stewsman would be a brothel-keeper as well. Whether bawdry counts as a criminal activity varies at different times and places." 
 thimblerigger  - a professional sharper who runs a thimblerig (a game in which a pea is ostensibly hidden under a thimble and players guess which thimble it is under) 
 
 Religious Occupations 
 If Government officials run the affairs of earthly beings, then those occupied with religious pursuits mediate between earth and the gods. 
 Priests are relatively common in role playing games. These men and women are the people behind the church: not typically "adventuring priests", but vitally important to the church nonetheless.

 summoner  - officer who brings people to episcopal courts (see also  government version ) 
 
 Merchants 
 In a society based on trade - either with hard currency or barter, there are always those who spend their lives in the pursuit of selling things to others. 
 Note that most craftsmen also sell the results of their labor, farmers typically must sell their crops themselves, people in service trades often must hawk their own wares. This section does not include them. It includes only those people who spend their entire lives devoted to selling things, and nothing more.

 Artists/Entertainers 
 In any society, there is the need for spare time. And what did people do before television? Well, they mostly sang songs, told stories, and danced. From this, some professional entertainers developed. 
 Also included in this section are artists: those who devote their lives to creating works of beauty and expressiveness. There is enormous overlap between artists and entertainersâ€¦ I won't get into the argument of whether art should be used to entertain or express the artist's true feelings. That's beyond my scope here, certainly.

 Farming and Workers with Flora and Fauna 
 Ah -- the farmers. Without them, we'd starve. Wresting sustenence from the very earth itself. There's a large number of occupations associated with farming: you need people to watch the animals, work the fields. In fact, probably most people in a medieval society were farmers. 
 Also included are hunters and gatherers: those who travel into nature and grab things to eat, as well as all those who work with animals. 
 There's also a good  overview of horse history in Europe .

Exciting and dangerous trade missions with far-off empires, exploring strange new places, and always coming back home to tell exciting stories in the local tavern.

 Regular Folks 
 One of the problems with coming up with a list of Medieval Occupations is that lots of people in a feudal economy didn't have occupations at all. They were just tenants of other folks. Also, there are in any society, a large number of homeless and impoverished. 
 This section deals with people like that. 
 There's a  fun story about a peasant , who had a bit of an adventure, at Stefan's Florilegium. 
 I've also heard that the book  A Medieval Life: Cecilia Penifader of Brigstock, c. 1297-1344 , by Judith Bennett, is recommended by some schools. It reconstructs the life of Cecilia Penifader, a medieval peasant, from various legal records. I've never read it, but it seems to get good reviews!

 Craftsmen 
 Game worlds typically have armorers and blacksmiths, but then it breaks down, and everything else is available from the marketplace or the "general store". Add a bit of spice to a campaign by having the player's harness become damaged, and have to deal with the local harness maker - who is also the town shoemaker and his loud wife! 
 Most of the occupations on this list are craftsmen and service occupations. Because of this, I have seperated out the most common craftsmen from the bulk of the list, so that the gentle reader can make sense of it. The list of common occupations was derived from the tax list for Paris in 1292, from the book  Life in a Medieval City  , by Francis and Joseph Gies. The number indicates how many there in the city.

 Service Occupations 
 There are many important positions in society for those who do not produce, but serve their fellow man. When they're done their job for the day, there are no new products, no changes in physical objects, but people are moved, jobs get done, and society keeps moving. These are the service workers. 
 Service workers can play an enormous role in your campaign. All the time, characters need to get their hair cut, have water fetched, or have something written down. 
 Unfortunately, since this list is so enormous, I've again taken the liberty of separating out the common occupations, again, as defined by the Geis book. The numbers are the count of the occupation in Paris, in 1292.
