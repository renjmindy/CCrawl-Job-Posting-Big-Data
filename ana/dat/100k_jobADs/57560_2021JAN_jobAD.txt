 "Be Your Best by Being Yourself©" 
 
 Location:  Marblehead, Massachusetts 
 
 How will clients benefit with you as their coach? 
 
 
 Understand how to move forward, working from the inside -out. 
 
 
 Using a holistic approach, I'll help you look at your strengths, skills, values, personal style and unique value-add. 
 
 
 Develop depth and breadth of understanding of yourself, your (targeted) environment, and what it takes to be successful in your career or business. 
 
 
 Understand what motivates you, learn how to lead with your strengths and articulate your value-add to others. Develop proactive, life-long career management strategies. 
 
 
 Develop self-leadership skills to continue to evolve and grow; whether you lead "one" or "many". 
 
 
 What results have clients reported after working with you? 
 
 
 Strong job search tools and knowledge (comprehensive resumes, interview coaching, LinkedIn online presence optimization) 
 
 
 Enhanced listening skills adding value to communications with customers, co-workers, management

 Clients acknowledge the value of being coached by someone who challenges, encourages and listens to them fully; personal coaching background adds value to work related focus
 What do clients say about working with you? 
 
 
 “Of all the things I've learned over the years, our coaching work has had the single biggest impact on improving my quality of involvement at work, and anywhere.”  -- Development Engineer at major High Tech company 
 
 
 “Lenore focused me on my communication skills, primarily listening. To my amazement, I found that I never really "listened" to people. I was able to improve these skills with internal and external clients. Lenore's assistance has been a vital asset to my career development and growth. I truly value her assistance.”  -- Technical Sales Program Manager for Network Computing company 
 
 
 “Lenore Mewton is an exceptionally talented Career Consultant. She has the ability to effectively partner with individuals and organizations to lead them through difficult transitions. Her depth and breadth of experience helped her clients remain calm, focused and prepared them to achieve their goals in a particularly difficult economic environment. She possesses strong group process facilitation skills and has the ability to plan and organize the group dynamics of workshops and networking meetings. Her clients consistently acknowledged the support, encouragement and direction she delivered in her 1:1 coaching sessions. Lenore is an engaging thought leader and an outstanding resource for anyone in transition.”  -- Director, HR Business Partner 
 
 
 “I feel privileged to endorse Lenore as an outstanding coach, mentor, and person of elevated culture who has expanded my horizon. I met Lenore through the American Chemical Society and through our collaboration I came to frame my professional values as a chemist working in the life sciences, into a rewarding and valuable body of competencies. She has been a quick-thinking and inspiring coach through times of rapid change, and her special talent is to build a lasting foundation of true confidence. Any individual or organization who works with Lenore will be improved.”  -- Organic Life Sciences Chemist and Entrepreneur 
 
 
 “After 32 years in media as a "work for hire" either as an on air talent or an advertising account manager, I was floundering and looking for some purpose in the my life and career. One night meeting with Lenore Mewton changed my life and career. She was able to break me down to my true essence or passion. During my career, I was happiest when I was working with young people on a sports talk show for kids. I had always wanted to teach and coach young people, and her advice and guidance gave me the confidence I needed to pursue my dream of starting my first business. I was so concerned about how I was going to make a living I had lost my way to finding my true self. Lenore gave me the mental support and confidence I needed. Interestingly over the past 19 months in business, I have been told by investors, that the passion I have for my dream is one of my greatest assets. Lenore unleashed that passion and now the sky is the limit. Needless to say the lesson learned from my time with Lenore was invaluable, and I would totally recommend her services to anyone who is contemplating a change in direction in life or career”.  -- President, Founder of Youth Sports Broadcasting Programs
