 Black and White Challenge

 "Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow?" (Job 38:22) 
 My daughter-in-law Carlie tagged me in a Facebook challenge to post seven black and white photos in seven days with no explanation or words. At the time, my life was spinning too fast to take her up on it, but tomorrow the holiday festivities begin with the first family arriving, and between now and the New Year, we have high hopes of seeing all twelve of our children (counting our in-law kids) and eighteen grandchildren except those who live in Belgium. Therefore, my life is going to be even busier . . . possibly too busy to write my blog! So, I'm thinking to have a series of seven black and white photos that depict what life has been like over the past few weeks (albeit interrupted over the weekend with my usual recipe post on Saturday and a scripture meditation on Sunday). Perhaps over the Christmas to New Year week I can post a series of color photos that relate to our holidays and the joy of family (from another popular challenge going around Facebook these days called "Grandma"). 
 Because my heart is to share the Lord, I'm allowing myself one scripture verse caption for each photo, but I won't indulge in any other explanations or words. Hope you enjoy! 
 HAPPY HOLIDAYS!

 The World Aswirl

 Have you been working on any poems for National Poetry Month? I've been agog with all the beauty swirling in the late April snows around Tanglewood Cottage, so I wanted to share a few of my favorite photos that inspired haiku: 
 "Still Beautiful" Cherry blossoms bloom,  But not here in Michigan.  Here snowflakes blossom! 
 "Artist" Great artists abound.  But in all the world I know  There is none like God. 
 "All Paupers Are Princes" Snows melt in the sun.  The world gleams with jewels.  Beauty is treasure. 
 "  Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow?  " (Job 38:22) 
 (P.S.—The photo of the cherry blossoms was taken by Elizabeth K. in Washington D.C.; they aren't blooming at my house yet!)

 Ode to Icicles 
 December 19, 2016December 19, 2016  by  Kathi , posted in  Around home ,  Current Events ,  Just for Fun... ,  Meditations and reflections ,  Michigan Beauty and Fun ,  Nature Studies ,  Poetry ,  Seasonal Pictures ,  Weather 
 Ode to IciclesBars on my castle 
Iced drops of rain 
Jack Frost was crying 
Out my window pane. Snowflakes dissolving 
Wept frozen tears 
Ringed like a tree trunk 
In hours, not years. Transparent carrots 
Grown in the wind 
Sunshine to water 
But no one to tend. Crystal stalactites 
Not from a cave 
Born in the open 
Where birds must be brave. 
 Swords of Damocles 
Hung from the sky 
Begging the question 
Is something awry? 
Fair jewels from snow 
Sharp as a knife 
More precious than bread 
The Water of Life. 
The longer they hang 
The longer they grow 
The longer I know 
My life must need snow. 
(—Kathryn W. Armstrong, December 15, 2016) "  Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow?  " (Job 38:22).
