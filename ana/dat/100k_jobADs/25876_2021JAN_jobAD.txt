 When people think of teaching jobs, the first thing that likely comes to their mind is an instructor in a traditional school setting. 
 However, more and more learners are shifting towards online learning environments. 
 This action is possible thanks to tech advances and the great internet. 
 Hence, instead of looking for online teaching job opportunities, you can really create these opportunities on your own! 
 I will show you what this entails in the following sections:

 HOW YOU CAN CREATE YOUR OWN TEACHING JOB OPPORTUNITIES? 
 
 Letâ€™s face it, working from home is a dream so many wish to have and itâ€™s so possible with the internet these days. 
 The research from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that 24% of employees did some or all of their work from home in 2015. The same study revealed that that number grew from just 19% in 2003. 
 While the jump might not seem significant, it points toward telecommuting being on the rise. Therefore, corporations have online teaching job opportunities available but they are super hard to find and get hired. 
 Therefore, you need to be more proactive and create your own online teaching job opportunities by which ing what you already know. 
 There are tons of people doing it and making a great living out of it. 
 There are also platforms where you can build your courses on so you can easily sell them because they already have a marketplace where people flock to get educated on the topic they want to learn: 
 
 Udemy 
 Skillshare 
 
 The courses can be set to the price of your choice and you are in full control of what and how youâ€™ll build out your course. 
 If you just go on those two platforms, you can already see samples of many different types of courses you can create in all different topics. 
 I believe they are free to sign up but they will take a percentage of your sales. 
 Even More Professional Courses 
 There are two other platforms where you can create your own courses that will have a lot more robust system where you can create course outlines, assignments, tests, polls, and a lot of other features that will elevate your course to another level. 
 The two are: 
 
 Teachable  â€“ this one is very robust, you will have templates, and will many features to make your course look very professional and organized. You also have drip course option and many great tools to use as well. 
 CourseCraft  â€“ this is a great starter one where you can create FREE courses to see how you like their platform before upgrading to a paid plan. 
 
 With all these options to build your own course, you will sure make your own online money in no time! 
 WHAT WILL YOU TEACH? 
 
 You will teach what you know of course! 
 Look, everyone knows something that someone else doesnâ€™t. 
 You have that knowledge that you can share with the world so you should do it. You really have no idea how much you could be helping people by sharing what you know. 
 It doesnâ€™t take that long to create a course, even at a small level, like you can start at the Udemy and Skillshare type of platform first. 
 Or go on there to learn how to create your own course! They have courses on there too for this exact thing: 
 
 For $11.99 a course, how could you go wrong? You can learn it very quickly and start to get a course online within a day or two. 
 There are so many topics on Udemy for example that you can teach from cooking to sewing to playing an instrument, to teaching people how to fish, you will have knowledge about something that someone else doesnâ€™t know. 
 BENEFITS OF CREATING YOUR OWN ONLINE TEACHING JOB OPPORTUNITIES 
 
 The benefits are long if you want to do this long term as youâ€™ll be reaping the benefits of having a  passive income . 
 Passive income is when you can earn over and over again without having do more work. Therefore, because your course is digital, you can sell it over and over again without doing more work on it. 
 The most youâ€™ll do is a little updating to ensure your course is up to date in case things change but for the most part, if youâ€™re doing a course that doesnâ€™t need updating for a topic that wonâ€™t change often, then youâ€™ll be earning truly passive income. 
 The other benefit is of course being your own boss and be able to make extra money from your home. You can also make this into a full time gig. 
 You could be reaching people that you never thought possible and impacting people around the world with what you can teach them. 
 Itâ€™s a feeling that I have been getting used to and find it amazing how many people my online business has impacted. 
 Youâ€™ll also benefit from being able to work on your own schedule so even if you have a full time job, you will be able to do this on your spare time to make some extra money. 
 TEACH LIKE ME, ANOTHER OPTION 
 
 There are definitely more options out there to be able to teach like the way I am teaching you how to create your own online course and make money from home on my website here. 
 You could also build a website like mine and teach people in this way by just writing these articles and sharing your knowledge about a topic you want to share with others. 
 I make a 4 digit online income from this and you can learn how to do this too by using the same exact training I used to build mine. 
 You can check it all out in  my free guide here : 
 
 I also offer free coaching services if you want to build this kind of business that Iâ€™m doing and you can find all the details in  my free guide  above. 
 With the vast internet these days, there are new opportunities for us to make money and if you donâ€™t learn to expand your skills, youâ€™ll be left in the dust and tied to a 9 to 5.
