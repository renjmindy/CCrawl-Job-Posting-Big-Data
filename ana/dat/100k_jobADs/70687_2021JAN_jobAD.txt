 Looking for a job? 
 Mar  29 
 ********In these days of economic uncertainty, more people are finding themselves out of work. In fact, in the US, there are now 12,806,000  former employees trying to feed their families and put a roof over their heads. Depending on your skill set and the number of others with similar capabilities, you may find it difficult to find a position in your field especially if the market is saturated. This situation may seem bleak, yet it could be a marvelous opportunity for you to reinvent yourself to find the job of your dreams. 
 So where do you begin? Why not start with some self-probing questions? 
 
 What do you REALLY want to do? What is preventing you from doing it? 
 What action could you take today to begin moving yourself in this direction? 
 What resources are available to you now? 
 Who do you know that is already doing this and who might be able to assist you? 
 
 Many people who ask themselves these questions find that their previous position was really only a means to an end. They really would have preferred to do something totally different. If that’s true of you, you might want to pursue further education in order to acquire new skills. You might even decide to become an entrepreneur and develop something on your own. Kate Middleton’s mum started her  own business  when she couldn’t find party supplies for her children’s parties. 
 What ideas do you have? Opportunity might be knocking on your door right now to pursue them. Will you go for it?
