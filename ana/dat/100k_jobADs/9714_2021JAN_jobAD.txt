 Leading with Reading or How I Found a Career that Nurtured my Book Addiction by Liz Garden 
 Posted by  CBethM  on July 22, 2017 in  Pay It Forward  |  22 Comments 
 I have discussed my book addiction with many different people. The first step is admitting you have a problem, right? I know I have a problem. I just can‚Äôt say no to books. I guess there are worse problems I could have. I have multiple to be read piles, yet I just signed up for a book of the month club. When I pack for a trip, the number of books might occasionally outnumber my articles of clothing. I can look in every direction in both my home and my office, and I will see piles of books. I have more bookshelves than any other piece of furniture in my house. I have an intimate relationship with my Amazon cart that is always full of books just waiting for me to hit the submit button. And while I don‚Äôt know the names of most of the streets near my neighborhood, I can tell you exactly how to get to at least six different bookstores that are within a 25 mile radius of my house. Yes, I have a problem. I am a readaholic. 
 Fortunately, I found the perfect job for a readaholic. No, I don‚Äôt work at Barnes & Noble or a public library. I am an elementary school principal. I literally get paid to help create readers. How cool is that?! I get to talk about books with kids and adults all day long if I want. I am able to have an office that looks like a library. I can walk through the hallways with a book in my hand and pop into any class during independent reading time every day of the week. If you walked into our school, it would not take long to see that we have created a school-wide culture of literacy. You might say my reading addiction and our school-wide culture of literacy has evolved into a symbiotic relationship. I feed off of the love of reading that surrounds me in our halls and classrooms and my love of reading fuels the love of literacy permeating our school. Of course, it wasn‚Äôt always like that. 
 When I first came to my school six years ago, the principal‚Äôs office was full of filing cabinets and binders. There were some classrooms that did not have a classroom library. (*Gasp, thinking back on those days still makes me shudder!) The school library was full of adult-sized furniture and the entire collection was outdated. There was no independent reading time. Usually if you walked into a classroom during a reading block, students were doing worksheets and on average two kids who completed all of their work were actually able to have some time to read from their book bags. Basically, it was a readaholic‚Äôs nightmare. 
 So I channeled my inner Donalyn Miller, rolled up my sleeves, and got to work transforming the culture of the building. And as my bookaholic bestie, Donalyn Miller, would say, ‚ÄúAdults who read and share their love of reading with kids send a powerful message that reading matters for personal reasons, not just academic reasons.‚Äù I knew that I needed to start sending that powerful message directly from my office. Filing cabinets and binders were removed and replaced with bookshelves and book baskets. I began writing a weekly blog post, often with a topic related to literacy, and one of the sections of my post was devoted to what I was currently reading. We needed to buy more books for the school. We needed to buy a ton of books. Conveniently, we had a reading program that some teachers were using. I collected all of the materials that came with the program. All of the basal readers that drain anyone‚Äôs love of reading. All of the teaching manuals that turn teachers into robots and kids into robot readers. I collected it all and sold it. And then I bought a ton of books. (And six years later, I am still buying books!) I reached out to our PTA to help us breath life back into our dusty, old school library. The place where no kid wanted to go. I put bookshelves in the staff room where people could borrow books for personal reading and bring in books to donate. I scheduled time in every classroom where I was doing read alouds and telling every student how much I loved reading. We planned events like ‚ÄòDress Like Your Favorite Book Character‚Äô day. We established a structure during literacy blocks where the expectation was that a bulk of the time would be devoted to independent reading time. No more one or two students reading in a class. Now, every student had his or her nose in a book during reader‚Äôs workshop. 
 Slowly, I began to see a shift. Students were talking to me in the hall about book recommendations. Staff were coming to me and asking to borrow books that I had mentioned in my weekly blog post. Kids were rushing to the library to check out the newest books that had been purchased. We were having staff book clubs to discuss different professional development books. Teachers were putting signs on their doors that told everyone what books they were currently reading. Every classroom had a classroom library. What was once my vision of how the school should be had become a shared vision amongst all of the staff. Books and a love reading could be found in every part of the school. We had engaged and motivated readers, both kids and adults! 
 Yes, I have a problem. I am a readaholic, and I am proud of that fact. And lucky for me I have a job where I get paid to encourage others, both adults and children, to become readoholics. I am glad that I chose the career path of leading with reading. To all my fellow administrators and educators out there, do you have a school-wide culture of literacy in your building? What can you do to shift the culture? There are a lot of future readoholics out there waiting for you to fuel their addiction!

 I want to be a teacher in your school. I have over a thousand books in my classroom and my principal has never mentioned it. üò™

 Aw, that makes me sad to hear. Invite your principal in to see your library!

 Wish I lived close enough to Groton that I could send my kids to your school! Any advice for how a parent and writer can help change a school culture to one like yours?

 Yes, get involved with your school. Share your thoughts/ideas with the teachers and principal. Offer to come in and talk about your reading and writing!

 How wonderful! Your students and staff are so fortunate to have a leader who is passionate about reading. Your district is unique, too, because they allowed you to establish independent reading time, sell the basals and redesign the library! Congratulations to all of you!

 Oh yes! Love this line: "I collected it all and sold it. And then I bought a ton of books." I smiled throughout this post! Keep making the beautiful difference you have been! Well done.

 Thank you for your commitment to keeping reading in our schools. I recently heard from my neighbors the library is only once a month (versus once a week when I was a kid) and most of the emphasis is on typing and computer skills. While keeping up with technology is important, we can't lose reading. Good work!

 Eek once a month?! Hopefully that will change. Reading has to be the foundation in our schools!

 Thank you for this initiative to help your students love reading! I noticed, though, that you did not mention a librarian in your article. Hiring a certified school librarian will fortify the reading program at your school. She/ He can create and implement other reading, literacy, and media literacy programs that will engage your students to become lifelong readers and learners ready for the next steps in their academic careers and ultimately become college and career ready individuals.

 Good news‚Ä¶this year we finally got approval from school committee to hire a certified library/media specialist! Very excited about what she will bring to our kiddos and the school!

 I love the environment you've created for your students and your teachers. You remind me of one of my favorite educators, Shelley Harwayne. If you haven't read her books (Going Public, Lifetime Guarantees, Living Between the Lines), you should. I think her writing will speak to you. 
 Wishing you continued success!

 wow, I really wish i was a student in your school. I just graduated from school and we did not have book shelves or even a book club in our school. Such a shame! I love reading and I have taken it upon myself to share the love of reading‚Ä¶ üôÇ
