 The Deserted Man 
 The deserted man 
 Mohd. Rafeeq, Pakistan. 
 I met him during my first encounter with the desert. 
 He sits here under the sun from morning to evening, checking and keeping the record of the trucks that comes to this area for sand. 
 He is the deserted man. 
 
 Check the previous ones  13. The Weighing man

 I do so much, we love all of your photos, sorry we have missed so many, have had a lot of health things… but we try to look at as many as possible. Hopefully almost done with appointments. 
I love them all, each one. And you, of course. Be well. ❤ -CC

 I love these - they remind me of the "people of New York" series - it's amazing to consider the variety of all these people's lives… think of the things they've seen, the stories they could tell. 
 Thanks for sharing.

 Your welcome. 
Btw your other website shows a white background only. Is it kept that way or am I missing any plugin?

 I visited your blog @  https://nikibayard.wordpress.com/ 
But I can also see nikibayard.co.uk associated with your name, which happened to be all white.
