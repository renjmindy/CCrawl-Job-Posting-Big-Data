 We are looking for current university students in the UK who are full of promotion ideas and also love fun and games. We have a new app called i2i which has a feature called social bubble which enables students to meet up in small groups of up to 6 cross-campus. Of course, at the moment, real-world meetups are possible in most places so we're doing zoom meetups posted on the app for fun ice-breaker games and get-to-know-you ideas: 2 truths and a lie, or Chubby Bunny (you need marshmallows for that game! The fact is there are a lot of students on their own in university accommodation with no-one to talk to so we want your help to create a fun, lively atmosphere which will lift everyone's spirits. If this is for you then get in touch!
