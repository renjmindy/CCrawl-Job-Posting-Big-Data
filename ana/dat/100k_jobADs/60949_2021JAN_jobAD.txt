  How To Find A Job In Another State During The COVID-19 Crisis  
 Jenna Arcand 
 May 07, 2020 
 With COVID-19 causing millions of people to work from home or file for unemployment, the job search is about to look at a lot different. Location is becoming less of a factor when it comes to our careers. If you're tempted to find a job in another state, here's how you should go about it. 
 
 It's important to remember that companies are focusing on hiring the right candidate now more than ever. So, if you have the skills and experience for your dream job that just happens to be in another state, you shouldn't let that stop you. 
 These are the steps you should take to find an out-of-state job during COVID-19. 
 1. Create An Interview Bucket List 
 When you're hoping to move or content with finding a remote job opportunity, it may be difficult to narrow down what companies you want to work for. This is why you should create an interview bucket list. 
 An interview bucket list will help you focus your job search. It's a list of 10 "dream" companies that you'd love to work for some day. Think about all the companies you are drawn to. Are you passionate about a product or service they provide? Do you connect with their mission? Are you inspired by their innovation and great  company culture ? 
 The whole point of creating an interview bucket list to help you figure out who to network with, reach out to, and start to connect with in order to find the job opportunities you want.  You can't do any of that until you get clear on who you want to work for and why. 
 2. Connect With 3-5 People At Your "Dream" Companies 
 Once you have that interview bucket list, it's time to connect with employees who work at those companies. We recommend connecting with at least three people on LinkedIn working in HR or in the same department that you want to work in. 
 The goal of connecting with current employees is to start a conversation  (and hopefully a relationship) with these individuals. 
 If you are looking to move to a certain location, you can start by saying, "I'm moving there by this date, and your company is on my bucket list of employers I'd love to work for." If you are looking for a completely  remote work opportunity , you can ask what the company's remote workforce looks like, while also explaining why the company is on your bucket list. 
 Remember: Don't ask them for a job. Ask them for information. 
 What do you do there? Why do you like it? How did you get your job there? These are all great questions to ask that'll help you gain insight into the company and their hiring process. Plus, you'll make a handful of strategic connections that you can leverage in the event you apply for a job at the company. 
 3. Get Good At Virtual Interviews 
 During the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person interviews are a no-go. Therefore, you're going to need to get good at  virtual interviews . 
 After connecting with and getting to know a few employees at your dream companies, you can set up a couple of  informational interviews  with them. This will help you get an even better idea of the kind of work they do, how they got into it, and how they became a successful employee at the company. 
 Of course, you won't be able to meet up with these connections at a coffee shop during COVID-19. Even if there wasn't a pandemic going on, your dream company is in a different state—and probably not a car ride away. This is where virtual interviews come in to play. 
 A virtual interview is what makes a remote job search work. It's also what makes remote networking  possible, like in the case of an informational interview. 
 If you want to find a job in another state during the COVID-19 pandemic, improving your virtual interviewing skills is critical to your job search success. 
 When you decide you want to apply to one of your dream companies, you'll have to go through multiple rounds of virtual interviews. You probably won't get to meet anyone in-person. They won't get to meet you face-to-face, either. So, their first and last impression of you during the interview process will be virtual. Make sure every virtual interview counts. 
 
 Finding an out-of-state job during COVID-19 is not impossible. In fact, it may be easier than ever to land one. No matter if you're looking to move after the crisis, or want to find a full-time remote job, these three steps will help you successfully navigate the remote job search.
