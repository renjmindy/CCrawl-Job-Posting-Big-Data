It is providing good solutions right now.” [Work At Home](http://youtube.com/watch?v=I7voRJkBsnM&app=desktop)

In fact, a recent report from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health estimates that the nation needs about 100,000 new contact tracers to help manage the COVID-19 outbreak. But you can still expect the competition to be fierce for this remote position.
