  Is It Ever OK To Tell Your Boss You're Looking For A New Job?  
 Ariella Coombs 
 December 19, 2018 
   
 Lately, we’ve been getting lots of questions around looking for work when you’re employed. One question that keeps popping up is, “Is it ever okay to tell your boss that you’re looking for work? I have a great relationship with my manager, and I don’t want to blindside him. I also think he’d be a great reference.” Here at Work It Daily, we don't advise telling an existing manager you’re looking for work… regardless of your relationship with him or her. It's better to tell employers that you’ll provide your manager or boss as a reference once you’re given an offer and accept it, and that the employer can make the offer pending the reference check. The reality is, the moment you tell your boss you’re looking, he or she will likely be upset and want to let you go… often before you have a new job. Don’t put yourself in a bad position. You might feel like you have a great relationship with your boss, but the fact is, you don’t want to risk getting let go before you’re ready.
