 This is unreal! I've been trying to think of a way to do a series of people I meet and encounter and the simplicity in this is awesome. Also‚Ä¶the man in the middle looks exactly like an older version of one of my closest friends ha.

 Thanks for the info. Thought it must be a high rise but it seemed so out of place in those beautiful surroundings.
