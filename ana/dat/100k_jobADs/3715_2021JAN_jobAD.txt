 You will act in a partnering capacity with the ability to provide comprehensive HR support to the business, primarily on a strategic basis but also on an operational basis when required.

 Understand wider operational priorities and how the HR team can support/impact on these i.e. absenteeism, costs, performance etc. 
 Influence and support stakeholders to ensure they take ownership and accountability for the performance and development of people 
 Collaboratively create and take a lead on the people plan for your business areas 
 Work closely with stakeholders to understand their resourcing requirements and in conjunction with the Resourcing Partner co-ordinate recruitment activity 
 Work in collaboration with the HR team to ensure the effective delivery of the People Strategy 
 
 It would be highly beneficial for you to: 
 
 Be able to support and implement change 
 Be able to build and maintain effective relationships and work across a wide range of contacts
