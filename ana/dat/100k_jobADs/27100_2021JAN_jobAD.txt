 A Final Lesson from Job—For Now, Anyway… 
 Posted on  September 15, 2020  by  Pastor Jim Dixon 
 Now in Job 36, as Elihu continues to speak to Job and his friends, it seems that, perhaps, Job’s self-righteousness is is downfall. He continues throughout his discourse that his circumstances are unfair because he’s lived a righteous life. Instead of pleading his case before God out of his righteousness, (and I go back to something I wrote earlier), what if he had cried out to God for deliverance? But, instead, he continues to try to justify himself before God…until… 
 …Until God asks Job who he thinks he is. Job is humiliated by his circumstances but humbled before God and repents of his self-righteousness. God restores Job’s life, blessing him with “twice as much as he had before.” (Job 42:10). 
 There are things about this story I still don’t understand. But the Lord has answered my prayer and taught me some lessons to apply to my own life and, hopefully, to share with others as well. 
 1. Don’t blame God for your circumstances, but praise Him in the midst of them. 
 2. Don’t look to well-meaning friends for your answers. 
 3. Seek God and ask Him to bring deliverance to your circumstances. 
 4. When you realize you’re in error, repent! 
 5. Remember that God is not answerable to you—or anyone else. He is God. 
 6. Trust Him to be with you through the storms of life. He will never let you down. 
 I’m sure there is much more I can learn from Job, and I’m looking forward to gleaning more from this book in my next Bible read-through.
