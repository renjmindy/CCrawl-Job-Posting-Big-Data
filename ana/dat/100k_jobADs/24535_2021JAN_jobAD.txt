 Where are the Best Jobs for Seniors? 
 Unemployment statistics always seem to be negative and at the same time, more seniors are finding it necessary to supplement their retirement income, or make career changes if not quite at retirement age.  It's possible with current economic trends that more retirees will be working to supplement income. 
 AARP at their website, aarp.org, provides a list of the  top 50 jobs for career change for those over 50 .  The top 10 in their list of 50 includes: 
 
 Home Health Aid 
 Personal and Home Care Aide 
 Computer Software Engineer 
 Medical Assistant 
 Network Systems and Data Communications Analyst 
 Dental Assistant 
 Self-enrichment Education Teacher 
 Compliance Officer 
 Dental Hygienist 
 Veterinary Technologist 
 
 And the list goes on, providing estimated income information as well as education required for the type of work described.
