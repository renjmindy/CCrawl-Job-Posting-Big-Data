 HQ To Reopen: Phased Reopening Plan Begins May 11 
 Tau Beta Pi headquarters is scheduled for a phased reopening beginning May 11. Since March 24, TBP staff has worked remotely in answer to state and local government guidelines. However, with the state of Tennessee guidelines ending on April 28, a new plan for phased reopening was set forth by state and local governments. That allowed TBP to put into action a plan, outlined below, to move staff safely back into the office. 
 Beginning May 11, the staff will be working under these guidelines, and others, to continue to keep everyone healthy: 
• Team members may continue to work from home throughout May. 
• Team members whose job responsibilities or work-from-home situation restrict their productivity may work at HQ. 
• No more than five people may work at HQ at any given time and is limited to one person in Marketing and Communications, one in Finance and Operations, one in Administration, and two in Member and Chapter Services. 
• Also, anyone working at HQ with health concerns are encouraged to continue work from home. 
 We value your membership and above all, hope that you are staying well. 
 
 Pi Bites: Working At Home Tips 
 from Joey Alexander 
 Joseph W. Alexander,   CA Epsilon '06 
 During the COVID-19 Pandemic many of us are finding new and inventive ways to work, to stay in touch, and to contribute to our community. 
 In this video, Joey Alexander, president of the Sacramento Valley Alumni Chapter, shares tips with those who may be working remotely for the first time and advice for those entering the workforce. Speaking from experience, Joey was job hunting during the 2008 recession, and he works remotely. 
 **Tips for working from home: 
** Have good Internet! 
Create a separate physical office space 
Keep to a schedule 
Turn on your video when conferencing to help with nonverbal cues 
 For recent graduates or those currently entering the job market: 
Be flexible (interviewing will be different) 
Keep your options open 
Look at stable companies, others might be suffering 
Make sure your resume is top notch 
Use your network & LinkedIn connections 
 
 Share your positive COVID-19 stories with us! We are on the hunt for more positive COVID-19 videos that we can share with our Tau Beta Pi membership. It can be as short one, too, like 30 seconds!
