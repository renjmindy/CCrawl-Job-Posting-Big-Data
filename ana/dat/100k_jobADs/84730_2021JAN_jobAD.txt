 The New Normal 
 If I'm lucky some of you have probably been wondering where I've been for the last few weeks. So, for the hearty few that have stuck with my poor, ill-fed blog lately, I'll fill you in. First off, I had a number of crushing writing deadlines to meet in the month of December and that kept me a little busier than I liked. Come to think of it, it was probably the hardest I've  worked  since I made a go of this whole stay-at-home-yeti thing three years ago. Seriously, it was a pretty punishing schedule for any time of the year, but, when you toss in the  holidays  and all the  craziness  that that entails, wellâ€¦lets just say I'm glad it's over. 
 And though Greta was devastated at the fact that we couldn't leave our  Christmas  tree up all year long, I've never been happier to put it all away. I know I sound like an old Scrooge, but, the clutter of Christmas really stressed me out this year. All I wanted for Christmas was a clean, clutter free house to work inâ€¦and an  iPad Mini . Preferably in black. 
 Luckily for me, I got both, and once the tree and stockings were packed away in the garage. My daily workload shot way up. So, yay for me. Of course, anytime I get a lot of work done I can't help but feeling guilty for ignoring  Greta . Yes, she loves to play alone in her room with her  Barbies  and My Little Ponys for hoursâ€¦but, I still feel bad anytime I'm knee deep in work and she's craving attention. So, we worked out a little deal most days. "Let Daddy work for thirty minutes and then I'll come play  Barbies ." I'd say. "That's not a good idea." She'd say. "Here's a better ideaâ€¦FIRST you play  Barbies  in my room, then you work." 
 You can guess who usually won that argument. 
 Anyway, despite the distractions, I did manage to meet all my deadlines and even squeeze in a very last-minute, whirlwind trip to  Dubai  and the  Maldives  to cover the inagural flight of flydubai's new non-stop service to the Maldives. The trip was amazing and though I'd like to say I got loads of sleep on the beaches there while the Indian Ocean lapped at my feet, my time on the beach was limited to a few dips in the water and one long nap on my private deck. Yes, we had private decks with full ocean accessâ€¦swanky, huh? And though the trip was magical and it was strangely liberating to not have to worry about carseasts and sippy cups for a few days, I came home with loads more work, so, it's back to crazy town any day now. Actually, the deadlines are a little more evenly spaced this time around, and there's not that pesky old Christmas/New Years crush to jam me up. But, we do have loads of birthdays, an  Oscar  party and Greta's fourth birthday party to plan, so, the next couple of months promise to go by in another crazy blur of activity. 
 So, if you don't hear from me for a while, know that I am juggling the twin joys of my life ( parenting  and  writing ) the best I can and that somewhere a Barbie is being played with. 
 Oh yeah, and about my new iPad Mini. It's wondrous! I don't know how I lived without it all these yearsâ€¦almost makes me want to add it to my list of "joys in my life". But, then I think  Mrs. Yeti  might start to feel a little bit slighted. Aw, screw it, I'm adding my Mini to the list, Mrs. Yeti too. Who says you can't have four joys in your life?
