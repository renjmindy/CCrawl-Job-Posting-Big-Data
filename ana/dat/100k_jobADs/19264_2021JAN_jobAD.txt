 Dear Bagel Factoryâ€¦ Part Two -> 
 A New Job. A New Chapter. 
 Posted on  November 10, 2014  by  Papa, Eden & Me 
 For at least a year now, I've been applying for new jobs. 
 I currently work as a 999 call taker in an ambulance control room. When I started this job it was for all the right reasons. I wanted to help people, I wanted to feel like I was doing something for the world etc. Still to this day I do love that side of the job. It's stressful, but I love it. What I didn't factor in was the management bureaucracy, the pressure, the stress caused by people misusing the service and the fact that no matter how much time I have off, I never feel fully awake. Then there were the obvious negatives like working bank holidays and Christmas, but I have never had a 9-5 Monday to Friday job anyhow so this wasn't new to me. 
 
 This was my attempt at "looking alive" after a twelve hour night shift and before the interview. 
 Anyhow, at the end of September I was invited for an interview. It just so happened that the interview fell after a night shift, so I arrived home at around 0830, showered, made myself look human and went back out in time for the interview at 11am. Somehow, I got the job! 
 So followed a month of getting references and such, today I finally got confirmation that this job is 100% mine! The references are fine, all the checks are done and I've handed in my notice. From December 1st 2014, I will no longer be an employee of any ambulance service. 
 I've never been more thrilled! My current job unfortunately has coincided with some very dark times in my life and I'm so very much looking forward to opening up a new chapter. The new job is a clinic clerk at a hospital, so still within the Health Service. I've taken a small wage decrease, but for the sake of my sanity that is a small price to pay. It's 9-5 Monday to Friday. 
 I'm not going to say that all of this job has been doom and gloom, because it hasn't. During my time at my current job I have met some awesome people - some of whom I hope will be friends for life. I've learnt a lot about myself and the world. I've dealt with some horrifying calls and have become stronger because of them, but I have also dealt with some real rubbish calls as well. I still remember the first time (still only one of two calls in three years) where a mother told me that her baby wasn't breathing. I remember every detail of that call. You would think that as a dispatcher, these calls do not affect you. But they do. I know that in my time at this job that I have done my very best for every patient that I have spoken to, no matter what their situation. I have comforted parents whose children are having seizures, I have reassured people with chest pains and I have helped people access alternative care pathways. I've heard the relief in people's voices as the ambulance has arrived and I've helped people keep their friends or relatives alive and I've helped people go from hysterical to calm. I'm proud of my time doing this job. I've also realised that I am much stronger than I ever thought I was. 
 Anyway, just wanted to mark the start of a new chapter. I should be starting on the first week of December, which means that instead of working for the whole of Christmas, I will be home with my wife and my Disney Christmas Tree!

 Couldn't do your job - I really couldn't. 
 Best of luck with your new one, it seems like you deserve the change going on the calls you've had over the years.

 You'd be surprised. It's just one of those things. What's frustrated me more over my almost three years there is management and people misusing the service, with the horrible calls at least you know that's what you're there forâ€¦

 Oh definately. It really does frustrate me when the emergency services are abused. Its annoying nothing is done to prosecute more often but then thats even more buerocacy.
