 Employee Testimonials 
 Information Security and Compliance Advisor: 
 "I joined WorkJam while it was still in the early stages. I have witnessed the company's growth and it has provided all kinds of opportunities for me to realize my evolving career goals. Every day, I feel a part of that growth and have pride in having developed such a highly successful product that helps with the lives of frontline workers. It has been a very fulfilling journey and I could not have started to work at a better place in my newly adopted home country, Canada." 
 Functional Consultant: 
 "I thoroughly enjoy working at WorkJam. I love working with such a dedicated, innovative, and talented team across all parts of the business. Working closely with our customers to implement a Digital Workplace platform that genuinely betters the working lives of their front-line workforce is incredibly rewarding. And, to be able to do that in a fun and friendly working environment is all the more satisfying."

 Technical Product Owner: 
 "I love waking up to go to work every morning! The team is innovative, bringing new ideas to the table every day to make our product better. We are all learning and growing together as strong professionals in a supportive environment. And, we don’t forget to have fun all along the way." 
 Developer: 
 "WorkJam’s mission to empower the frontline worker to think and behave like a leader is something I notice in the hearts and minds of everyone who works here, every single day. The passion, empathy, and drive to make the life of non-desk workers a little better is easily visible. We have fun as we work and we’re excited to build a product that is the People’s Champion (I hope THE ROCK smells what we’re cooking)!"

 Product Marketing Manager: 
 "WorkJam is a rocket ship. And while overcoming gravity necessarily exerts pressure, each passing stage forges us into a tightlier-knit team of front runners. If you’re willing to put in the effort, you’ll become part of a great company–and of a story worth telling."
