 Eight times you should ask for a raise 
 If you’re going to work up the courage to ask your boss for a pay bump, you want to have the odds stacked in your favor. That means lining up your accomplishments, preparing what you're going to say, and getting the timing right. That last bit is often overlooked, but you need to know when to ask for a raise just as much as you need to learn to know how. You have much better odds of success when your company is doing well. When profits are up, managers often have more money at their disposal to reward their employees, especially their top performers. Here are other times when it makes sense to ask for a raise.  ](/salary-benefits/salary-negotiation-tips/should-you-ask-for-a-raise/article.aspx)

 Establish a salary range 
 It's perfectly natural to want to jump at the first job offer that comes along. But at the same time, there's no point in taking a job that won't pay the bills. That wastes everybody's time and can lead to frustration as well as financial problems for you down the road. Establishing a realistic salary range that reflects your actual income requirements is important. Once you've done that, the whole process of finding a job becomes much easier.  ](/salary-benefits/salary-information/Establish-Salary-Range/article.aspx)
