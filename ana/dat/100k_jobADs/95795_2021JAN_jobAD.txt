 Job Interview 
 "Never seen anything like it, Cap'n," said Fenton, staring at the dapper man in a white suit, neatly groomed goatee, and bolero tie. 
 Green nodded and presented his ID to the man. "Captain Green. London Department of Super-Normal Affairs and Job Placement." 
 The man shook his hand. "Pleased tuh make your aquaintance, suh. Ah am Jeffrey Whittaker. Of the Bourbon County Whittakers, that is." 
 "Would you please hold this for a moment, sir?" Green offered a lighter. 
 "What in tarnation is thayut?" 
 "It's a lighter." 
 Whittaker took it and lit his cigar. "A more peculiar gizmo, ah've never seen. Seems efficacious enough, though." 
 Green turned to Fenton and murmured. "That lighter should have dropped straight through his hand." 
 "He's a ghost," whispered Fenton, consulting his meter. "The readings are spot on across the board." 
 Green turned back to Whittaker. "I'm sorry to tell you this, but you aren't in the Mississippi river. You aren't even in America anymore. This is London" 
 "Well ah can see thayut. Lookee over yonder. That young lady gallavantin' around in her unmentionables. " 
 "They're called, shorts." 
 Indeed, they are. She has lovely ankles, though. Ah can't decide if ah've been hurled into one a' Dante's levels of Hell and a Den of Iniquity or carried on the wings of angels straight tuh Heaven." 
 "Doesn't seem like an angry spirit," muttered Green. 
 "We couldn't easily find a better historical source," replied Fenton. 
 "Would you be interested working on the Dixie Queen as Historian and Tour guide, Mr. Whittaker?"

 About EagleAye 
 I like looking at the serious subjects in the news and seeking the lighter side of the issue. I love satire and spoofs. I see the ridiculous side of things all the time, and my goal is to share that light-hearted view.

 Heh I like that ðŸ˜€ Did you Google the Dixie Queen as well? 
 I think Whitaker would be the perfect person to be a guide on the ship

 Yes, I did. I thought for a bit this was one of those replicas on the Mississippi, where gambling actually legal because it isn't in any state territory. When I saw "London" under the name, yeah, I had to google it. 
 Now they just have to figure out how to pay him. I suppose plenty of Kentucky Bourbon and the company of a young philly or two may be payment enough.

 A young Philli filly ðŸ˜‰ When I saw it, I knew I had to use it for the Photo Fiction. I wondered why gambling was done on the boats. I take it they can't gamble when the boats are docked?

 Yup. In most US states, gambling is illegal. State territory goes out into the Mississippi a bit, but only so far. So if the boat cruises beyond that boundary, then gambling suddenly becomes legal on the boat. 
 This is a great pic and I'm glad you used it for this venue.

 I think these are positive qualities. A Southern Gentleman should always be an engaging and likeable fellow. I'm glad he came off that way.
