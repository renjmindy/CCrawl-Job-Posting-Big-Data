 Research Enthusiast / Computer Scientist (m/f/d) for participation in research projects 
 Are you interested in methods and tools in software development for embedded systems? 
 Your tasks 
 Within the framework of research projects, we explore the potential uses of new (model-based) methods and tools.

As part of your work, you can learn about current methods of software development from research and examine their operational capability in real development. In addition, you can prepare the use of tools that support these methods together with our partners. You also learn how to handle safety standards, such as with the ISO 26262, with the DO-330 or with the IEC 61508, which are indispensable in the development of modern technical software in cars, airplanes or complex technical systems. 
 For example, you take on the following activities: 
 
 Collaboration on the concrete objective of the research work 
 Coordination with our research partners 
 Investigation of the development process of our industrial partners; Conducting interviews
