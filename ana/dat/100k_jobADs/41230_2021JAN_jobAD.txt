  5 Big Questions To Ask Yourself Before Taking A Job  
 Kelly Kuehn 
 May 30, 2019 
 This is it. It's the light at the end of the tunnel. After going through the hiring process, you're offered a position! Congratulations! It's a big accomplishment and you should be proud of yourself. However, just because you got the offer doesn't necessarily mean you should accept it on the spot. 
 Think about it -- would you buy a house without considering what it means for you in the long run? Your career shouldn't be any different. It's a huge investment for both you and your potential employer, so some serious thought needs to go into your decision. Before you accept that offer, ask yourself these five questions: 
 
 
 Is This The Role I Want To Pursue? 
 This question may seem like an obvious one to ask, but it's still important. There could be a huge difference between how you view the job and how your employer views it. Take another look at the job description to make sure it is, in fact, what you want. 
 Are there skills you'd really like to use on a daily basis? If so, make sure they're a necessary part of the position. Are there skills or projects you DON'T like using on a daily basis? If so, see if they're required for the job and, if so, how often you'd need to pull them into your work. It's important to know what your role will be and what will be required of you daily. This is also a good time to ask your potential employer to clarify anything for you. 
 Am I Going To Be Happy At This Job? 
 Your happiness level at your job will impact your work. In  MetLife's 17th Annual Employee Benefit Trends Study , 90% of workers surveyed said their loyalty is directly tied to their happiness. Is this a place you can see yourself going to everyday? Do you share the company's core values? Do you like the company's culture? Your happiness is key for productivity, and it's important to evaluate if this job will help you thrive. 
 Can I Meet My Employer's Expectations?

 You got an offer for a reason. The hiring manager thinks you'd be a good fit for the company after looking over your resume and going through a series of interviews. They believe you can do the job, but do  you  believe you can? Be honest with yourself. This is a big step for both you and your potential employer, so you want to be confident in your skills. Taking another look at the expectations of the job is never a bad thing, especially if you haven't accepted the position yet. That way, you can gauge your skills, and determine if you can meet -- or even exceed -- your potential employer's expectations. 
 How Do I Feel About My Future Boss and Co-Workers?

 Think back to your in-person interview when you met your potential boss and co-workers. What were your first impressions of them? Did you think your boss was someone you could work for happily? If you take the job, you'll be spending a lot of time with these people. It's important to be honest about how you feel about them. 
 Will This Job Help Me Grow In My Career? 
 Think about your short-term and long-term career goals, then take another look at the job description. Is this job going to help you reach those goals? The position should help you grow as a professional. If you aren't sure about opportunities for advancement, this time allows you to reach out to the hiring manager and ask.
