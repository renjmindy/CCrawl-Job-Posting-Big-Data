  4 Mistakes That Will Derail Your Job Search  
 Don Goodman

 January 05, 2021 
 For some people, it may just take a month or two to go from job hunting to landing that dream job offer and starting work. 
 However, it's not always that easy and smooth of a process. 
 
 As a job seeker, you may not have much control over the employer's interviewing and hiring process, but you do have control over how you approach the job search process. Avoid the chance of extending your job search or unemployment by being proactive with your job search efforts. 
 Here are four things that will derail your job search, and why you should avoid them at all costs. 
 
 Procrastinating 
 For some who can afford to take time off from work, that's great—but don't extend the time off to the point of laziness. 
 The bigger the gap between employments, the more negative it reflects on you. It also doesn't help you make the case that you're a professional who's driven and on top of the game in your profession if you've been  out of work  for an extended period of time. 
 Relying On Applying For Jobs Through Job Boards 
 There are various ways in which you can go about the job hunt. Looking at job boards for the right opportunities and applying to them is one way, but not necessarily the most effective technique. 
 Employers may receive hundreds of resumes through job boards and the chance of them picking out yours is slim, if your resume even makes it past the Applicant Tracking System (ATS). The best way to get your resume in front of the right person is through a referral from networking. Utilize contacts you have to help get you in front of the right people. Expand your job search to LinkedIn and Twitter. This is where you may make more  direct contact  with the individuals that matter. It's better than sending your resume to the general HR inbox. 
 Settling For The First Job Offer 
 Yes, getting a job offer is exciting, but it doesn't mean you should accept it. Really understand if it's the job you want and if it's a job that will pave the way to where you want to be in your career. If you're unhappy, you'll only wind up back at Step One—job hunting again. 
 The only exception to this is if you've been looking for a job and unemployed for a lengthy time and you want to use it as a platform to help boost the chance of  landing a better job . It can be easier to impress employers when they know you're employed than if you've been unemployed for a long time. 
 Telling The World You're Unemployed And Asking Them To Help You Find A Job 
 Advertising to your entire network of contacts that you're unemployed and need help finding a job isn't necessarily going to help. This is reaching out blindly where you send a generic resume to everyone you know. What you want to do instead is direct your time and effort to  customizing communication  to select individuals who can help you. 
 When you send a personal message seeking advice, you're bound to get a better response. 
 You need to put in the effort to get real results in your job search! Don't let any of the mistakes above derail your efforts!
