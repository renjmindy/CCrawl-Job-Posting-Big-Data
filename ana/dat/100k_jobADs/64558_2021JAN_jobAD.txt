 Actress Sues Individuals Over Craigslist Job Posting Allegedly In Her Name 
 April 22, 2008  by  ABA Antitrust   Leave a comment 
 Unlike many plaintiffs in other Web site posting cases, this one is suing the users who actually posted the content as opposed to the service provider (Craigslist). The causes of action are fraudulent impersonation, appropriation invasion of privacy, false light invasion of privacy, conspiracy to invade privacy, and conspiracy to commit criminal conduct. No separate claim for violation of the right of publicity is stated, although it might be included in appropriation invasion of privacy.
