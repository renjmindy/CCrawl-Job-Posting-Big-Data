 Types of: Coworkers 
 As we begin our life in the workforce, we realize that every job has the same people. Well, maybe not the same  looking  people but the same types of people. So, the real question is where do you fit in this group of misfits? 
 
 The Cookie Monster 
 
 This person goes around to everyone‚Äôs office and takes whatever sweets, candies, or snacks they can find. You think they are coming into your office (or cubicle) to say hi, but really they just want a piece of candy that‚Äôs sitting on your desk. This person even goes into offices after people leave to grab some sweets. You garbage disposal, you. 
 
 The Pushover 
 
 This person goes above and beyond to make sure everyone is happy, from replenishing the coffee to make copies of stuff for you, to organizing and reorganizing the entire office every other day. You need to take like just one chill pill, man. 
 
 The Therapee 
 
 This person talks to everyone about everything because they obviously don‚Äôt get enough attention at home from their spouse or their cat. Either way, they treat everyone like a therapist, and it‚Äôs so stressful. I CAN‚ÄôT HELP YOU WITH YOUR COOKING FAIL AT YOUR IN-LAWS LAST NIGHT, SARAH. 
 
 The Confucius 
 
 Unlike the actual Confucius, this person has literally no idea what‚Äôs going on in life. Sometimes they even make you wonder if they know they work here. They walk around asking everyone else what to do or how to work something. This may even be the upper-level employees. How do you still not know how the coffee dispenser works?! 
 
 The Juggler 
 
 This is the person that has just WAY too much to do. They are barely in the office and when they are, they don‚Äôt have time to talk to anyone unless you literally trip them in the hallway to talk for the few seconds it takes them to stand back up. Usually, it‚Äôs the bosses or the VPs because they have a million meetings to attend, but chances are that they have no idea what the meetings are about‚Ä¶even after they leave. 
 
 The Millennial 
 
 This person is constantly on their phone or social media accounts. Every time you walk by they are on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest‚Ä¶or even blogging‚Ä¶ Anyway, no matter the age or if they are actually a millennial, this person can‚Äôt stop socializing online. Hopefully, they also have a job in social media marketing or something similar so that they can cover up their addiction and not get fired their second day. 
 
 The Mom 
 
 This person is the one who would bring in pastries on Mondays and remember people‚Äôs birthdays so there was a cake for them. It‚Äôs more than likely a female only because most men can barely remember their own birthdays, so let‚Äôs just be sexist for this one. Anyway, this is the person you want to be friends with right away because they‚Äôll probably tell you first that there‚Äôs free food in the conference room. 
 Comment below which is you! 
 Until next time,

 7 Thoughts Starting a New Job 
 Now that you have graduated, starting a new job is a lot harder than you think. Some of us have to work jobs made for high schoolers, in fact some of your supervisors could be younger than you. Some of us have to work meaningless jobs at the lowest level possible. Some of us will get jobs that put us way in over our head. Others will have jobs that make us question our entire life so far. However, there are 7 thoughts that will go through your head when you start this new job after undergrad. Whatever the level of the work, intern or career, you will have these thoughts and probably some of these facial expressions, too. 
 First, it may not be the prettiest job in the world, but it will pay the bills‚Ä¶kind of. 
 
 -- 
 Second, you will forget what it is like to have major responsibilities 
 
 -- 
 Third, you will be so over the cliques already in place at your workplace. 
 
 -- 
 Fourth, you will realize you don‚Äôt care to make new friends. 
 
 -- 
 Fifth, you will realize no amount of money is enough for you at this point. 
 
 -- 
 Sixth, the drive to work will be really dreadful and no music can help. 
 
 -- 
 Seventh, you will be so jealous of the young, hopeful interns and realize how uncool you are now.

 Judging a Book by its Cover 
 Don‚Äôt judge a book by its cover. Or maybe just judge a little. 
 Isn‚Äôt this what we have always been told? Don‚Äôt judge anyone too quickly, it‚Äôs rude. Shame on you. 
 Yet at the same time, we are told ‚Äúdress to impress‚Äù because first impressions are the most important. Wouldn‚Äôt that be because someone is judging us off our appearance? 
 Oh the contradictions. Thank you everyone for teaching us one thing, only to enforce the complete opposite. 
 Let‚Äôs face it, everyone judges you off first impressions. It‚Äôs what helps us land a job, make a new friend, meet a future spouse, be generally accepted by ‚Äòsociety.‚Äô 
 So what do we do? Do we be ourselves or be the person who will be accepted by the general public? No wonder our youth of today are in a constant battle about appearance because this is when we first start to realize that appearance matters. Peers start to judge and gossip about each other in school. They make fun of those who are different than them. Then in college we say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what people think; I‚Äôll wear sweatpants everyday if I want!‚Äù Then we graduate and realize we need buy business casual attire because it actually does matter how we look; no more piercings everywhere, no huge tattoos, no crazy hair, no crazy ensembles. 
 -- Which is where I need to throw in a little PSA. No crazy ensembles means shopping time, which means more spending of money, money that recent graduates do not have. Okay, I am done venting.- 
 It is a constant battle between wanting to be liked and wanting to be independent. What should we teach as more important? There is no easy answer for this one. Always be true to yourself, even if that means wearing different clothes or having a different attitude as long as you are working toward a goal you have set for yourself. Most will find that your true goals are easy to attain without changing much about yourself because it matches your personality anyway. Do things in the name of you. Do it for yourself. Things always have a way of working out. 
 In regards of judging others‚Ä¶ 
 Some people say judging others is a sin. But sometimes it just pops in our head. The key is to not let that initial judgment be the lasting one. Maybe your initial judgment of someone is correct but give yourself time to be wrong; I usually am.

 Phases of Post-College Life 
 There are many phases of life after graduation. You're completely normal for going through all of these. Don't be afraid‚Ä¶ just be a tad concerned. 
 1. The Hopeful Phase -- "I have a chance! I'll get my dream job and be able to travel finally!" 
 This first phase has tricked us all. Got me, too. It's hard not to be positive when every university/college encourages you to chase your dreams. You know what I have to say? Thanks. For. Nothing. 
   
 2. The Graduation Day Phase -- "Wait, it's over already? No, no, no, no, no I don't think I'm ready for this." 
 Now the idea of not having a clear future hits close to home. As you sit there with your beautifully stiff cap and gown on, you think about how you are about to be released into the world. How many of us were actually ready for that one? (Those going back to school don't count. You don't need to worry about your job‚Ä¶yet‚Ä¶you'll be next, though, darlings.) You start to panic and beg to be let back into the university to maybe get a second or third degree. Please? 
 
 **3. The Beginning of this "Career Search" Phase -- "I'm going to look for my dream job. I have a college degree so I'll be ahead of most people out there." ** 
 Graduation-Day-Depression is over, and you are determined to stay positive and find your career job. People all seem to have jobs around you, so how hard can it be? The naive determination keeps you going. Hold onto this last childish-hope that you have. This phase will probably either last a few days before the next phase starts up or it will never end for you. Stay strong, my friends! 
 
 **4. The REAL Job Hunt Begins Phase -- "I'm just going to add every little useless detail of my accomplishments to my resume. That should definitely get me the job. What's a little embellishment?" ** 
 You start getting a little desperate now. Don't worry, it's natural. A little embellishment isn't a lie exactly and is not always illegal. It will only get you in trouble when your future employer is smarter than you‚Ä¶and chances are they will always be. But that never stops people! Keep chasing that laser. 
 
 **5. The Realization Sinks In Phase -- "Yeah, I'm screwed." ** 
 Realization that there may be no hope for you. Beware, this is a pretty low phase. Some may even become zombie-like, and if you come across people like this stay far far away. 
 
 **6. The Cynical Phase -- "Why did I even go to college? Why did I spend thousands on tuition for no hope of a future?" ** 
 People start being very cynical around you‚Ä¶or maybe you're making everything seem cynical because of your state of mood. I mean how useless can you get? A crisp, white piece of card-stock engraved with gold writing with your name in the largest font‚Ä¶maybe it could be a giant name tag to mark my territory? I told you Phase 5 was real rough; it even bleeds into this phase. The only difference: people start reminding you how screwed you are. 
 
 7. The Bottom-of-the-Barrel Phase -- "I think I've officially hit rock-bottom." 
 This is when you succumb to all those feelings of inadequacy and apply to any and every business you pass on the street. It's nothing to be ashamed of; everyone has had a job like this. If anything, it just means that you'll never give up and keep pushing through the tough times! Also, just beg employers to make up jobs so you can be employed: "I'll be the window-washer for your three small windows." 
 Although this classic joke never gets old‚Ä¶unless it's you, then it's very very old. 
 
 **8. The Completely Hating This Adult Life Thing Phase -- "I'm worth more than this!" ** 
 SO you finally get a job and you make close to nothing. So half the battle has been conquered, I've gotten a job (whether your career one or a temporary one), and I'm still poor. Working doesn't just equate to money, instead it equates to time spent getting just enough to pay taxes and eat Ramen noodles. Mmm I can just taste that sodium now. 
 
 9. The Poor Person Phase (everlasting?) -- "So what do I want to do this Friday night? Let me hunt for change under the couch first." 
 It's definitely time to reevaluate the financial situation. This phase may last forever, but just remember you'll make it through. Shoot, if you've made it to Phase 9, then you're golden! Look how much you went through already. Be strong and proud of that accomplishment. I like to think things are just getting more expensive. 
 
 **10. The Can-Things-Get-Any-Worse Phase -- "Now everything is a just joke to me. Haha‚Ä¶ha‚Ä¶h‚Ä¶" ** 
 This is when you start to analyze and compare every aspect of your life. Stay sarcastic, my friends. It's all we may have left by this phase. 
 
 And remember, you have an army of new graduates being funneled through this Phase System ahead of you and behind you. Just think how many more phases there will be for those graduating after you! Consider yourself lucky in that sense. And consider yourself lucky to have gotten an education because some people weren't able to be like you. Stay strong and good luck! 
 P.S. - I'm at Phase 4 FYI.
