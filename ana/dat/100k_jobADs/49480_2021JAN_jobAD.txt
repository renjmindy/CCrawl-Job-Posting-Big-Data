 Clarine Seymour: A Charmed Career But a Short Life 
 The ascent of  Clarine Seymour  (1898-1920) in the film business was nothing short of meteoric, like a ladder with several, clear rungs leading only upward. It must have seemed to good to be true to many -- and then it was. 
 Still a teenager, she started out in supporting roles in the Pathe serial  The Mystery of the Double Cross  and two  Thanhouser  pictures,  Pots-and-Pans Peggy  , and  It Happened to Adele  , all in 1917. These were east coast productions, made while she was still living in New Rochelle under the roof of her father, a retired ribbon manufacturer. These appearances got her hired by  Hal Roach  to be the leading lady in around a dozen  Toto the Clown  comedy shorts in 1918. While there she also had a memorable turn as the "Pretty Lady" in  the early Stan Laurel short  Just Rambling Along . 
 This work brought Seymour to the attention of  Victor Heerman , who screen tested her to become part of  D.W. Griffith's  company in 1919. For Griffith, Seymour appeared in  The Girl Who Stayed Home, True Heart Susie,  and  Scarlet Days  (all 1919) and  The Idol Dancer  (1920), her first starring role. In just three jumps in two years she had become a movie star. 
 Seymour had begun shooting her part in Griffith's  Way Down East  when, from out of the blue, she was struck down with an intestinal ailment, finally succumbing to pneumonia while in the hospital. Her scenes in  Way Down East  were re-shot with  Mary Hay  in her role. A few months later she was eulogized by  William Desmond Taylor , who would be dead himself within months. There must have been moments in the early 1920s when it seemed like the movie industry was cursed.
