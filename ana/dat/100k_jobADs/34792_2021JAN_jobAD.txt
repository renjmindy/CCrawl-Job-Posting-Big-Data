  How To Prove You're The Perfect Person For The Job  
 Jessica Holbrook Hernandez 
 May 09, 2015 
 Don’t you love when someone just “gets” that you’re the perfect person for the job? They see your value and what you bring to the table immediately, but then there are others you’ll never convince.  Related: 4 Ways To Make Your Resume Perfect For A Job Opening  How do you communicate the ROI the employer will receive for hiring you as opposed to another to those who may not readily see it but are open to it? This question came to me as I was working with some prospective clients over the past week. 
 
 Prove You're The Perfect Person For The Job 
 Some employers are dead set on doing it their way, only hiring someone with X number of years of experience or they think they know exactly the type of person (and personality) they want to hire—and no manner of explaining is going to change their mind. These are the people you just have to let go. I’ve learned you can’t get all worked up over those who will never see it. It’s not worth stressing yourself out over someone who will just never “get it.” However, there are those who may not see the perfect fit that you are—but once they’re enlightened to it they very easily see that the positive outcomes outweigh the costs. Whatever those “costs” may be. Maybe it’s the degree you haven’t finished yet, those two years of experience that you haven’t obtained, or something else altogether… How can you as a potential candidate for the job communicate the value, return on investment, and the many benefits they’ll receive upon choosing you? Here are a few suggestions I’ve discovered along the way that I hope will serve you well: 
 In The Interview: 
 Who can argue with experience? Share examples of how you’ve successfully tackled similar problems and situations in the past. Theory goes, if you’ve been successful with something once before, history will repeat itself. These examples will speak volumes because they’re not statements about how you might handle something; they’re statements about how you’ve already successfully overcome something. 
 On Your Resume: 
 Make sure that you use C.A.R. statements (  challenge, action, results  statements) that help to illustrate exactly the challenge you were up against, the action you took to address the challenge, and then the great results you achieved. S.A.R. is very similar; it’s  situation, action, and results . Whichever you use, they’re great tools for communicating exactly what you’re capable of bringing to the table by demonstrating what you’ve accomplished in the past. 
 While Networking 
 Let your passion show and focus on expertise. Whether you’re networking in person or online, focus on your areas of expertise. Discuss what you’re passionate about. Your excitement and enthusiasm are contagious, and people catch on to that. Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and your own professional Web site or blog are great places to share your expertise with others. Write about what you know, what interests you—and do it in a way that helps others who enjoy the same things or are in need of help. When talking with others in person, that contagious enthusiasm is much easier to pick up; others will easily see why it is that you love what you do, and they’ll see the value you offer as an expert in your field. It’s important to be yourself, positioning yourself as an expert, and show that you’re passionate about what you do. Like I mentioned before, that excitement and enthusiasm you hold inside you for what you do will shine through—and others will catch on to it a lot quicker than you think.
