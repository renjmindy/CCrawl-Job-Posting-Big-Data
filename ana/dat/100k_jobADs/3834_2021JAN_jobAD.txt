 <- 11 Questions about SEX that you should ask – part four 
 Should you tell if you saw someone's mate cheating? -> 
 Finding a Job in 2011: I may not have the “Golden Voice” like Ted Williams but Give me a break! Part Two 
 Posted on  January 25, 2011  by  Ressurrection 
 Let 's Continue… 
 That is exactly why I have applied for positions that highlight entrepreneurship and the arts or business positions that allow me the freedom to focus on marketing including website content, newsletters,communications, press releases and other related work. 
 Floyd Wilson Jr . of the Prince George's County Executive Office told me one day after inquiring about me having a master's degree, "You have naturally what other people go to school for." 
 I am passionate about this. I am up in the middle of the night writing about getting a job. If I had working capital I would be in business. The longer I stay out of work, the harder it is to take care of home. 
 I am employed I guess you could say. If a few massages a week count as employed to you, I qualify as under-employed. 
 I have applied for Business Development Manager for the Arlington Employment Center. I am over qualified in 3 of the four qualifying factors. The final factor is previous employment with an employment center. Is this a joke? You have got to be pulling my chain, especially since they will not interview me but they have interviewed several others that do not meet their desires. 
 I have applied with Economic Development for their Business Manager position, but they hired someone before getting to my name I guess. 
 And, now Artisphere! To be honest, I spent so much time on the previous two applications that I really just threw anything together and sent it in. 
 So a few days ago, I tried again this time focusing on my true abilities and what I bring to this beautiful artists' paradise in the heart of Rosslyn (Arlington, Virginia) as a Program Director. 
 200+ applications later, I am still praying for the dream opportunity as a consultant or employee with benefits. I am homeless and tired. Without God I would crazy too, but I am thankful to have my strength and my sanity. 
 All homeless people aren't inadequate, uneducated, mentally ill, or impossible. There are many greats who at one point shared this title with me. I need my living homeless to end. 
 I solicit your prayers and your wisdom. If you have read this article and have a position that you think I would be perfect for please reach out to me by email: somebodysayword@gmail.com 
 Ted Williams is getting a completely new lease on life. Tyler Perry and Kem found their Tipping Point, I am seeking my own. 
 Meanwhile, My memoir is named, Identity Crisis, Identity Christ Is: A Journey to Love

 (Note: I just wrote 992 words on my blackberry, without blinking, there is no reason why I should not have a job with a nice salary and benefits)

 I Had A Dream And It Came True! (Wedding) 
 
 
 Ressurrection 's Wedding on the National Mall - OPEN INVITATION August 28, 2013 
 The President is expected to attend the festivities at the Martin Luther King Jr. and/or Lincoln Memorials to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the March on Washington and the I Have A Dream speech. One couple in the Nation’s Capital will commemorate this speech with their wedding ceremony scheduled at the Jefferson Memorial at 2pm on August 28th, 2013. During this monumental wedding ceremony the couple will share their vows and incorporate their Martin Luther King Jr. inspired theme, “I Had A Dream And It Came True.” An earthquake shook the Washington DC Area on August 23rd, 2011, and a Tornado followed that week. But the sun came out on August 28th, 2011, the 48th anniversary of the, "I have a dream" speech. After Graves returned from the opening day of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial her Groom made his move, they talked over a game of chess, in which she won the game and his heart. Graves had witnessed a reenactment of Martin Luther King Jr. speaking on that day. She believed it to be a tape recording until she saw a gentlemen from California drawing a crowd. With such a rich beginning Graves and Groom intend to share their nuptials as a public testament of their strength, faith and love. They welcome those who celebrate love to join them on the lawn of the Jefferson Memorial, at 2pm on August 28, 2013 the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.’s speech saying, “I Had A Dream And It Came True.”

 Originally posted on True Discernment: The Greek word “pharmakia” literally means “drugs”, and appears five times in the New Testament: in Gal 5:20, Rev 9:21, 18:23, 21:8, and 22:15. “Pharmakia” is translated into our English Bible as either “witchcraft” or…
