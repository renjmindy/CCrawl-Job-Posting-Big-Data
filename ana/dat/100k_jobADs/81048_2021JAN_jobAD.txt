 This isn't even possible. This 'sudden' drop in unemployment would require a 4 plus % job growth -- and that didn't happen lasts month or the month before. 
 But not a surprise. This below 8% unemployment was predicted in December of last year by Rush Limbaugh. The regime will play whatever games necessary to make it appear Obama's failures are a success. The Obama regime is all snuggly in bed with the corrupt lap dog, liberal media. 
 Americans continue to do without jobs, survive on unemployment, Food Stamps and other government handouts, just as Obama wants. The more people dependent on government for their 'daily bread', the better he likes it -- part of redistribution of our wealth as he, and his unfit, dastardly regime, see fit.

 "All people are endowed by their Creator with the inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We fought a war to regain these rights from our old government, and we created the Constitution to keep our new government from ever taking them away again."

 Ronald Reagan 
 "Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the United States where men were free." Ronald Reagan
