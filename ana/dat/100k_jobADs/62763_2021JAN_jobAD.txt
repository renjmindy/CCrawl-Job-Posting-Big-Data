  3 Ways To Practically Guarantee You Get The Job  
 Ryan Niessen

 February 06, 2020 
 Have you ever had the experience of sending out your resume  everywhere  , and getting no results? No emails. No callbacks. No interviews. It sucks, doesn't it? I had that experience a few years back. And then a profound realization changed everything for me. I realized that... 
 
 You've got to make an irresistible offer. 
 And a boring, traditional resume just doesn't do that. 
 See, employers and recruiters are used to seeing the same thing over and over: a plain-Jane resume and cover letter. And they're  dying  to get something fresh. Something that makes an impact. Something that's  irresistible. 
 We've all sent in boring resumes in our lives. But now, it's time for an update. So, here are three ways to practically guarantee you get the job: 
 1. Prove You'll Earn Them More Than You Cost 
 Here's the truth:  You need to make your employer a profit. 
 Meaning hiring you comes at a cost. And likewise, the effort from the work you do brings in revenue. 
 So, what's the easiest way to practically guarantee you get the job you're applying for? Simply prove, based on past results, that you're going to bring in more revenue to the business than you cost them. 
 For example, one campaign I thought of and helped run at my past employer paid for my annual salary within a couple of weeks. That's solid, tangible, and  quantifiable proof  that I'm worth more than I cost. 
 So, if you haven't already, start thinking of measurable ways you bring in revenue for a company—and then put those detailed examples on your resume. The numbers will speak for themselves. 
 2. Provide Credible Proof That You Can Perform 
 Testimonials from credible people—whether they're mentors, peers, employers, or teachers—are one of the best ways to show proof of past performance and character. And  past performance combined with character  ( cultural fit ) are two huge elements employers look for in potential employees. 
 The good news is that LinkedIn has made gathering these testimonials easier than ever. So, if you don't have any yet, think of a few people that could provide great testimonials for you, and ask for them. They'll make a huge difference in your next job application. 
 3. Work To Learn, Not To Earn 
 When you're first starting out and you don't have proof of generating results or credible testimonials, then the best way to get your foot in the door (if you're unable to  successfully network  your way into the company) is by working for free for a week, or even up to three months. 
 In fact, I got my dream job—the position I had my heart set on—by offering to work for free for three months. Now, of course you don't want to do this for ANY employer.  Only offer this if you're fairly certain that working for free will lead to a job, and that job will open up a world of opportunities within 2-3 years for you. 
 That's what it did for me, and that's what it could do for you. 
 BONUS: Stand Out Online! 
 Your bonus tip is to stand out online. Why? 
 The first thing any employer is going to do when you apply is Google your name.  And what if what they found blew them away so much so that they shortlisted you for the position immediately? 
 That's what can happen with a great online presence. And nowadays, that's easier than ever to achieve. You don't have to be tech savvy, you just need to know how to  optimize your LinkedIn profile  and make your  personal brand  known to colleagues, recruiters, and hiring managers.
