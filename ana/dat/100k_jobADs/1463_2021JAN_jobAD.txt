 We are a team of eight pursuing the dream to start a company, Otium Circle, and are now at a stage of expansion (quadrupling our revenue every year). Do you thrive in high performing teams? Are you looking for an exciting challenge in a growing start-up? Want to gain real experience and ownership of your sales role? Then we promise reading on will be worth your while! ðŸ˜ƒ 
 Otium Circle is a community of lifestyle businesses. We are passionate about connecting business owners, nurturing collaborations and educating our community. Ultimately we are building a community of businesses that support each other and launch new products and services together. We therefore increase revenue for these boutique and exclusive companies whom we call our Partners. 
 You are a person that can connect quickly with people, can tell a good story and are well organised. We need someone to take over full ownership of the second step in getting new paying customers for Otium Circle: initial phone calls with potential new Partners to offer to connect them with our current Partners (this will include doing a bit of research on them to figure out which of our current Partners might be interesting for them to connect with); to tell them more about how Otium Circle works; and sending follow up emails and setting up video calls between Pascal (one of the co-founders) and the potential Partner. You'll be completely taking over this second step in our sales process from our co-founder Pascal and Sales Lead Teo, so you'll be walking a path that we understand well and you'll be fully trained and supported during this internship. 
 This is a sales role. Our Partners offer a range of products and experiences: e.g. rare whiskey, jewellery, collectable cars, yachts, bespoke travel; so there's no lack of inspiration of what Partners (ones that are already part of our community or ones that are potentially going to join) can be connected together! Authenticity is what our audience is receptive to so you are genuine, supportive and transparent. The ultimate goal for you will be to create a connection between Otium Circle to potential Partners which motivates them to join Otium Circle. 
 You will have the flexibility to work from anywhere you like close to Europe's time zones (we are a 100% remotely working company). You will get to know the team on our weekly video calls and regular chats on WhatsApp. The reward is getting to do what you're passionate about and working in a team you enjoy. Financially the reward is an equitable share in cash payouts at specific revenue targets: apart from time worked in Otium Circle, everyone is treated the same regardless of job/experience. 
 We are looking for someone for a minimum period of 10 weeks and expect a weekly time commitment of 10 hours. We will pay you Â£1k with the opportunity to stay with us for the long term. You should be passionate about what you do, and not initially motivated by financial reward. We believe this role is most suitable for people at a pre-career stage who want to build a portfolio of work.

 - Send follow up emails/calendar invites to chat with our co-founder Pascal, and update our Salesforce CRM system with the latest updates

 - Connect quickly with people 
 - Tell a good story 
 - Clear, fluent spoken English, easily understandable to people for whom English isn't their first language
