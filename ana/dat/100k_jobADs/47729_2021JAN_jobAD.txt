 Joseph Nebus's Sense Of Humor 
 A thought about a career I never felt like trying 
 I realized that I'm glad I never got into a field that looks for experimental results. I realized that's got to be pretty bad. I mean, imagine you do some research and it gives you the expected result. Everyone's going to answer, "No duh". But imagine you did the research and it came out surprising. Then everyone's going to answer "No way". Whatever happens you're getting worn down. The only safe harbor is research that nobody has any response to. I couldn't hack it in the field of getting responses.

Nope. This is a 1960 production. So as much as I did not understand how King Features’s YouTube page was bundling these shorts together, I now understand them even less. Or I don’t understand them more. Whichever. As usual for a … Continue reading "60s Popeye: […]")

I still am, and that’s why I got another chapter riffed and published this week. If you’re tired of me giving the Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment to a harmless book that’s caused nobody any trouble, well, maybe … Continue reading "MiSTed: The Tale […]")

Lord Grunyard rules it, in name. He’d rather not have anything to do with anything. It’s actually ruled by the people living there, and he’s fine with that. They use Grunyard as a shield against meddlers like King Arthur “fixing” their nice setup. This was established in the … Continue reading "What’s Goi […]")

Maybe it was an in-joke at Paramount Cartoon Studios. So here’s Going … Boing … Gone, a story by Joseph Gottlieb and directed by Seymour Kneitel.

 [MiSTed: The Tale of Fatty Raccoon, Chapter XI](https://nebushumor.wordpress.com/2021/01/15/misted-the-tale-of-fatty-raccoon-chapter-xi/ "So I decided to go ahead and riff another chapter of Arthur Scott Bailey’s 1915 animal-adventure novel about how much he hates his own raccoon protagonist. Not to worry, I posted it to Usenet first, so that I have something new written this year to give rec.arts.tv.mst3k.misc. There is a little change, though, as you … Continue reading "MiSTed: The Tale […]")
