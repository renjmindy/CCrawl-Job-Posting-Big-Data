 Career Advice from an Inspirational Journalist 
 
 Great Career advice - for any career 
 Hiya, 
 My wife pointed me to this excellent article on becoming a freelance journalist by George Monbiot. The clue is in the word '  free  '. But even if you're not trying to be a writer the words here will inspire and provoke thought with regards to your own hopes and dreams. 
 If you're still under 30 you may still have hopes and dreams, if you're over 40 you may be wondering where they went. Read the article and it might just remind you‚Ä¶

 Hiya, 
 When was the last time you stopped and really evaluated where you are headed and why? 
 It‚Äôs possible things have changed since you set yourself on your present course. 
 Maybe it‚Äôs time for a course correction, a deviation onto a slightly different path. Maybe an about turn altogether. 
 How will you know?

 Is updating your CV (Resume) a waste of time? 
 
 Have you asked yourself this lately? 
 Hiya, 
 I for one have never got a job based on my CV. In fact I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had a CV. Maybe I‚Äôm fortunate, I‚Äôve never looked for a job, one always presented itself as the old one came to an end or had served its purpose. 
 For a lot of people their CV is hugely important, maybe you are one of them. But consider this for a moment.. .what are the key elements of a CV? 
 
 Where you are at the moment 
 Where you were before that 
 What your education level was 
 
 I know it‚Äôs more involved than that but that‚Äôs basically it. 
 The thing is  that  is ALL about who you  were . If you want to experience something new you have to think differently than you did before. You have to try on a new mindset. Try a new perspective. Otherwise you are just looking for more of what you have right now. And if you‚Äôre reading this you probably have some frustrations about your job, right? 
 So ask yourself: is getting a better version of your present job the answer? 
 If it is - Great! Sort your CV out asap. If not, you might want to think more about where you want your life to head over the next 5 - 10 years. 
 The right job or career for you could be in your very near future, but if you don‚Äôt identify it now, you‚Äôll never recognise it when it comes along. 
 Put that work in right now and figure out what it is you‚Äôd love (or even like) to do. 
 Let me know in the comments below. üôÇ

 How To Ignore Negative Comments. 
 
 Look familiar? 
 Stuart Young, London, UK 
 Hiya, 
 Do you ever get negative comments at work, or even about work? 
 Maybe they are comments about your skills or abilities, maybe they're comments about your achievements or commitment. 
 If you think about them honestly you might even agree with some of them. If you do, maybe you are in the wrong job! 
 You could decide to avoid those negative people that you can, and ignore the negative comments of the ones you can‚Äôt. But that might be burying your head in the sand. 
 Maybe you hear negative comments when talking about your ambitions and dreams. If you think the comments are unwarranted then just say in your mind ‚Äò  They don‚Äôt know me‚Äô  every time they bring you down with words like: 
 ‚Äò  ‚Ä¶be realistic‚Ä¶  ‚Äô or 
 ‚Äò  ‚Ä¶you‚Äôre no good at that‚Ä¶  ‚Äô or 
 ‚Äò  ‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs your strength‚Ä¶  ‚Äô etc. 
 As you learn to do this you will believe in yourself more and more. And that‚Äôs a good feeling. 
 
 My new book: ‚Äú  Do You Hate Your Job?  ‚Äù reveals how you identify if you're in the right job and what to do if you're not. Get it right now at NO COST before you make any BIG decisions. 
 Maybe there's someone you know that‚Äôs struggling to get out of bed every work day - get a copy for them.

 What can you say YES to today? 
 Stuart Young, London, UK 
 Hiya, 
 Take the opportunity today to say YES to something you would normally say No to. 
 Is this a tricky one? Hmm, not sure. I think some of you might find this difficult depending on what the thing is and how challenging it might be. 
 To others it might be a simple choice of having a cup of coffee after your lunch when you normally don‚Äôt. Either way, try and say YES - see what happens. 
 Maybe there's something you're asked to do at work that you'd normally refuse because it's not your job - today, have a go. Say "  Yes, sure, I 'll do it. " See what happens with the rest of your day. Does it get better, worse, stay the same? 
 _" Without change, there would be no butterflies. _ ‚Äù ~  Anonymous

 How often do you thank? 
 Stuart Young, London, UK 
 Hiya 
 Take the opportunity today to say thanks. 
 This is the simplest thing in the world to do - and sometimes the hardest. We all have occasions where saying thanks to someone really sticks in our side. Sometimes we might even decide not to say it at all. 
 But saying thanks under those conditions can really make a difference, not only to the person you‚Äôre saying it to, but to  you  too. 
 When you can say thanks, and mean it sincerely, you are on the path to building a bridge with that person. That relationship could end up growing stronger or at least more bearable. 
 You can even say thanks to the universe for just being alive! 
 On the easy side - saying thanks to someone who has just held the door open for you or moved aside to let you through can brighten  their  day. 
 That thanks will wind its way through the day passing from one person to the next and the next. Be the one that starts that process off and then enjoy the thought of where it might end up. 
 You never know, your easy thanks in the morning could end up being someone else‚Äôs difficult thanks at the end of the day. 
 Nice thought huh? 
 Tomorrow is Monday - first day of the working week for many - give some thought right now to who you might thank at work - even if you really don't want to. 
 Even if you hate your job at the moment, find someone you can sincerely thank. 
 
 Grab a copy of "Do You Hate Your Job?" right now at NO COST, if not for you then for someone you know that‚Äôs struggling to get out of bed every work day. It will you understand if you can actually fall in love with your present job, or whether it's time to quit.

 What do you like about your job? 
 Stuart Young, London, UK 
 Hiya, 
 Take the opportunity today to consider your job and find three things you‚Äôre happy with. 
 1. I'm quitting soon,  or  2. the toilets are clean, etc. - do NOT count! üôÇ 
 I understand this might be difficult for some. Try it though and see if you can ‚Äòhonestly‚Äô find three things that you are happy with about your job. 
 This could be the start of you appreciating it for what it is. We've all heard the grass is greener right? Maybe if you stopped looking at what is 'wrong' with your job - just for today, you might find there's a lot you actually like. 
 It must start with you, all of your happiness, contentedness, peacefulness etc. comes from the way you think about your circumstances. 
 If you get to the end of today and you really have struggled to find 3 things you like - you need to read my new eBook: "  Do You Hate Your Job?  ". It's not very long, but it is laser focussed on helping you understand what you must do next. 
 
 Grab a copy now at NO COST, if not for you then for someone you know that‚Äôs struggling to get out of bed every work day.
