 'The White Line' To Have Its Run in Joburg, Rwanda, New York 
 Posted on  10 Oct 201911 Jan 2021  by  Donald Matthys 
 Desiree Kahikopo's  The White Line  will be screened at the Joburg Film Festival, set to run from the 19 to 24 November 2019 in Johannesburg. 
 The six-day film programme includes all the excitement and Hollywood pizzazz associated with red carpet premieres, screenings and awards as celebrities rub shoulders with serious filmgoers in a rich display of filmmaking at its very best. 
 So far, the film has screened at two festivals in South Africa, the Durban International Film Festival and got curated by the Durban International film festival to screen at the Hilton Arts Festival in Durban as well. 
 Director Kahikopo said being curated for the Joburg Film Festival is really awesome as South Africa has one of the largest film and television industries in Africa. 
 "To get an opportunity to showcase our film there really is a step in you know, for recognition as an industry, our stories and what we too have to offer. When I was in Berlin at the Berlinale I spoke about Namibia’s Unique voice within the African Cinematic movement and I wanted Namibia’s voice to be heard and our stories to be seen within Africa and the Diaspora and having to get chance to do this at this great African film Festivals where African meets and the world meets Africa its incredible," Kahikopo said. 
 According to Kahikopo,  The White Line  has also been selected the 15th Rwanda Film Festival happening now in October and at the New York African Diaspora Film Festival in New York happening end of November. 
 The film was also selected for the Cape Town International Market and Film Festival which has been unfortunately cancelled for this year and will take place only next year. 
 "I’m really glad that and grateful that we are getting headway outside of the country one step at a time," Kahikopo said.
