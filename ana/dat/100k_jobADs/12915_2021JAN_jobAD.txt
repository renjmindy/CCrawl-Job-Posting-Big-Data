 We require additional Blueberry Pickers to start immediately through to the middle of February. (If you have applied before and are still looking for work them please reapply as we are finding a lot of previous candidates have found work when we are contacting them but we may have missed some people). We will be working 6 days a week (weather and fruit dependent). The position is paid by piece rate and the rate is $3.40-$5.00 per kg (depending on the fruit variety and the time in the season). 
 Number of Positions Available  : 40
