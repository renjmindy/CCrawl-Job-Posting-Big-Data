 The Mercury News 
 For many people, looking for a new job is at the top of their list of New Year's resolutions. 
 And according to jobs and career information site LinkedIn, if you want to get in on some of the up and coming industries, you might want to brush up on your engineering skills. 
 On Tuesday, LinkedIn released its list of emerging jobs for 2020. And as LinkedIn says in its report, it's never a bad time to be an engineer. 
 According to LinkedIn, more than half of the top 15 emerging jobs in the United States are tied to engineering to some degree. LinkedIn said that its data is based on all LinkedIn members who have had a public profile on the site and have held a full-time job in the U.S. in the last five years. The company then calculated the share of hiring and compound annual growth rate for jobs between 2015 and 2019. 
 Leading the LinkedIn list is artificial intelligence (AI) specialist, or someone who focuses on machine learning and ways to incorporate artificial intelligence technology into business environments. 
 LinkedIn said that AI specialist jobs have grown annually by 74% over the last five years as demand in computer software, internet, information technology and consumer electronics industries has increased. AI specialist salaries also have a lot to be excited about, as LinkedIn said its data shows such jobs average $136,000 a year. 
 And for those looking for AI specialist jobs, LinkedIn said the San Francisco Bay Area is among the top regions in the country for such positions. Hiring is also strong in New York, Boston, Seattle and Los Angeles. 
 Second place went to robotics engineer, with a 40% growth rate and average annual salary of $85,000, while data scientist, and its growth rate of 37% and $143,000 average salary came in third. Fourth place went to full stack engineer, a job that pays $82,000 a year on average and has a 35% growth rate. 
 Site reliability engineer ($130,000 a year), customer success specialist ($90,000 annually) and sales development representative ($60,000 a year, on average) all tied for fifth place with an annual growth rate of 33%. 
 The rest of the top 15 emerging jobs included data engineer (33% annual growth rate, $100,000 a year salary), behavioral health technician (growth rate of 32% and an average salary of $33,000 a year), cybersecurity specialist ($103,000 a year) and back end developer ($88,000 a year) both with a 30% growth rate, chief revenue officer (28% growth rate and a $330,000 average salary), cloud engineer (growth rate of 27%, $100,000 in average salary), java script developer (growth rate of 25%, $83,000 annual salary) and product owner (24% growth rate with a $100,000 annual salary). ___  Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.
