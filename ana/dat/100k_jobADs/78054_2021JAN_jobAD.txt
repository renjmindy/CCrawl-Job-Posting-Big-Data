 One Image, One Question: June 6, 2019 
 By Edward M. Bury, APR (aka The PRDude) 
 
 The conversation at the DePaul PRAD showcase was spirited as guests intermingled with the master's students who effectively presented their work and themselves. 
 The challenge: Which of the 30 members of the cohort group should I speak to during the showcase and networking event. 
 The potential impediments: There was a time factor -- just an hour or so. There were people I knew, other Chicago public relations professionals, who I had to engage with. And, this being early evening, there was that great buffet table, its contents the antidote to my hunger. Consequently, my time had to be allocated strategically. 
 Now for the situation: I was a guest at the  DePaul University  Future Leaders Graduate ePortfolio and Networking Event, held yesterday at an the  Chicago Connectory , an appropriately-named co-working space on the fifth floor or the  Merchandise Mart . 
 This now annual event provided a showcase for those who recently earned the  Master's in Public Relations and Advertising.  The recent graduates were billed as "future leaders," but I maintain they are today's leaders. I visited with six, but would have welcomed the opportunity to meet them all. 
 I was impressed by their poise, understanding of communications and creativity -- and not just because some shared gummy bears and chocolates. They were practiced and straightforward, savvy and skilled in conversation, even when I posed a challenging question. 
 One graduate was balancing a few job offers, another maintained social media platforms for a lifestyle company as a freelance account. And, one participant highlighted her athletic prowess in her presentation, while another graduate showcased photography skills. 
 Again, I was impressed. 
 Now to the Question: 
 Will these skilled modern communicators have the right stuff to help keep communications advancing, to navigate the unceasing era of negativity, "fake news" and whatever modern society and technology ushers forward? 
 I enthusiastically say they do. Your thoughts are welcomed. 
 Aside: A shout out to my friend  Ron Culp , PRAD Professional in Residence and a truly iconic figure in public relations, for inviting me to the showcase.

 Thoughts on Accreditation from Anne O'Connell, APR: A Q & A 
 By Edward M. Bury, APR (aka The PRDude)\ 
 For the past few years, one way I gave back to the public relations profession was to help nurture professionals who were pursuing the  Accredited in Public Relations (APR)  credential through my volunteer work on behalf of  PRSA Chicago . 
 I'm pleased and proud to share these thoughts from Anne O'Connell, APR, a Chicago area communications professional who participated in the Chapter training program in 2014 and earned the APR earlier this year. 
 Here's Anne's unedited replies to my questions regarding the APR challenge. 
 1. Congratulations again on earning the Accredited in Public Relations credential. What was the most challenging part of the APR process? 
 Thank you, and again, I appreciate your help. It’s hard to pick just one most challenging aspect as the overall process is taxing. At first, I was worried about the timing of the research and my case study. How would that mesh with my readiness review and the timing, based on the year, during which to take  the examination ? Michael Henry (of  Online2Learn , producer of the APR online study program) also was helpful in reassuring me that my timeline was doable. The case study does require a lot of mental energy, but it’s worth it. 
 2. How do you plan to use the knowledge, skills and abilities learned from the APR process in your work? 
 I already have been using  the KSAs  in my current position. I have been informally mentoring my staff in the best practices I’ve learned. I work at an all-girls private high school and have started a club for students interested in public relations, journalism, graphic design and related fields. I have shared some of my new knowledge with these students, as well. 
 
 Anne O'Connell, APR, was recognized for earning Accreditation by PRSA Chicago at the Chapter breakfast March 25. Oh, and that's me at left. 
 3. Can you provide a brief overview of the experience at the ProMetric Testing Center? Were you intimidated in any way by the rigid testing process? 
 I checked out  the ProMetric center  prior to my testing day. The staff were helpful and explained how things would work. I wasn’t intimidated. In fact, one thing I found slightly amusing, on the morning I took the exam, was the staff told me if I went into the testing center with my zip-up sweatshirt on (over a T-shirt), I’d have to keep it on for the duration of the test. Other tidbits were I could not take Kleenex into the testing area, nor could I take a couple of cough drops I had in my sweatshirt pocket. Now, I would not cheat, but even if I were so inclined, there is no way one could put cheat notes on a cough drop wrapper! 
 All that aside, the test itself was situation after situation – very much process based, as all had indicated. Each screen gives you a scenario and then multiple-choice answers. I took a break to get a drink of water about half-way through. The time seemed to go quickly, though I did not feel rushed and had extra time than I needed to finish. I found some of the answers to slightly contradict what I had learned, but I chose the most logical answers that were closest to being what I considered being correct. I only marked a few questions to return to ponder further, but when I did so, I left the answers as I originally had them. 
 4. The numbers tell the story: The APR program has been in decline, and PRSA has launched a concerted program to boost participation by professionals. What do you think needs to be done to get more professionals to pursue Accreditation? 
 I’m not up on what has been considered or done, but perhaps college/university professors could be engaged to help encourage students to pursue the APR once they are eligible. It occurs to me, though, having just met a young professional that the timing is interesting. Once graduating from college, s/he needs five years in the profession. That timing roughly puts people around the age of getting married and then perhaps having children. Maybe there is a way to quantify that the APR enhances one’s earning potential, and that could be promoted extensively. 
 5. In 50 words or less, give a shout out on why all serious PR professionals should consider earning the APR. 
 I highly recommend that serious PR professionals earn the APR. I am much more strategic, valuable and confident. I wish I would have pursued my APR earlier in my career. One of my goals now is to directly encourage colleagues I know and then mentor them through the process.

 Ron Culp Shares Thoughts: Five Replies to a Q and A 
 By Edward M. Bury, APR (aka The PRDude) 
 Today,  The PRDude  continues a time-honored (well, sort of) tradition: A Q and A with a fascinating figure from public relations. 
 But rather than run down the very, very impressive list of credentials earned by subject  Ron Culp  , I'll make it easy: Visit  Ron's online biography  and spend a few minutes reading about this consummate pro. You'll learn how he cultivated a truly remarkable career highlighted by stellar professional achievements and outstanding volunteer contributions to public relations. And, now, the author of the very popular  Culpwrit blog  has charged forward to nurture the next generation of communicators. 
 From the "full-disclosure department," Mr. Culp has graciously re-blogged some  PRDude  posts over the past few years, and I'm honored to know that along with public relations, he also has a fondness for the towns and lakes of southeast Wisconsin. 
 Here's Mr. Culp's erudite responses to five questions. 
 1.  You 've successfully navigated the corporate and agency sides of public relations. What were specific public relations challenges faced in each arena ? 
 _ _After working for four major corporations, I discovered that the critical communication processes are remarkably similar no matter if you 're producing pharmaceuticals, office equipment or consumer products. At Sears, I was blessed with an extraordinarily talented team of public relations pros who got to know every aspect of their respective businesses. As a result, the PR team became an integral part of the business. Leaders running major business units sought out counsel on everything from product promotion to internal communication. This relationship with my team allowed me to know critical information about every aspect of the business, which provided me with a unique vantage point within the organization. Without a doubt, the bigger the company the greater the challenges and we were inundated with "opportunities." Due to the size of the business and promotional nature of the store, we worked with a large number of agencies-nearly 50 at one point during the "good old days." 
 Only after I joined the agency world did I fully appreciate challenges facing consultants, especially those who only receive one-off tactical projects. Their access to information is often limited to what is shared by the corporation so they must make assumptions that are sometimes correct and often wrong. Agencies that enjoy longer-term relationships with clients normally deliver the best and most cost-effective results. Agency client directors and teams who fully understand their respective businesses and convey a sincere client-first commitment become top-of-mind when additional assistance is needed. Creating that special  esprit de corps  is one of the key challenges facing any agency leader today. **** 
 2.  Public relations, like advertising, could point to "legendary" figures who shaped the profession from its founding days to not too long ago. Who's at the pinnacle in today's digitally-driven world? 
 We wouldn't be where we are today without the legends who got us to this point of respectability for what our profession can help organizations achieve. I remain in awe of the contributions to the profession by some of the greats that I've been honored to know and work with over the years- Al Golin ,  Harold Burso n,  David Finn ,  Dan Edelman  and, of course,  Betsy Plank . Today, I think the leaders of most large agencies and the CCOs of many of the top corporations are led by incredibly talented and innovative individuals. While there is consensus around  Richard Edelman  being a current day pioneer thinker in our profession, several of his peers and certainly corporate leaders like J on Iwata  (IBM) and  Gary Sheffer  (GE) also are significant players in raising the bar of respect and influence for our profession. **** 
 3.  You made a very cool transition from leading a major agency  to leading the PRAD Master's program at DePaul University. How did you land that gig and what's your biggest take away? 
 While heading  Ketchum's Chicago office , I signed up with the  Plank Center  for its academic fellows program that places PR profs in a dozen or so corporations and agencies during the summer to gain real-world insights to then share in their classrooms. Luckily, my office was assigned  Teresa Mastin from DePaul.  At the end of her two weeks of engaging with the Ketchum team, she asked me if I would consider teaching a class. I agreed to do so for one quarter and instantly got hooked and was happy to become an adjunct. When they asked me to help find someone to fill a newly created position of professional director for the grad program, I volunteered after another candidate I tried to help recruit turned down the offer. While I've enjoyed every phase of my career, I can honestly say this is the most rewarding work of my life. My DePaul colleagues and I draw incredible inspiration from seeing our students land their first jobs and then excel in them. Realizing that we're helping train the future of this amazing profession provides a great deal of personal satisfaction. **** 
 
 You 're a fellow blogger with the very popular Cuplwrit.com blog for "guiding the career in public relations." What prompted you to enter the blogging community? And, what advice do you have for fellow PR bloggers? 
 
 I knew very little about blogging some eight years ago when I was approached by three Ketchum interns suggesting I consider starting a blog to provide advice for young people pursuing careers in public relations. Dressed as if they were going to an important new business pitch, they presented a persuasive PowerPoint case on why I should blog. They ended with the clever name, which was the brainchild of  Kevin Saghy  (now on the Cubs PR team). I have been blogging ever since, and I haven't missed a week in all that time. 
 My advice to fellow bloggers is to find your passion, and post something regularly. Put dates on everything you write since this will remind you of the need to post at least once a week **  . ** 
 5.  In 50 words or thereabouts, offer thoughts on the direction PR is headed. 
 Public relations (and I prefer those two words over the host of others that attempt to camouflage what we do) has never been in a stronger position as a profession. There is growing demand for talent, and colleges are turning out future professionals who are better trained than ever. However, as corporate and agency expectations for our services grow, there are two factors that concern me-writing and business intelligence. With few exceptions, educational institutions place too little emphasis on writing and business basics. Young professionals who can write usually are good thinkers, and those who understand how businesses operate are going to have highly rewarding careers. 
 
 Want to know the thoughts of other PR heavyweights? (Figuratively speaking, of course.) Here are Q&A posts from: 
 
 Gerry Corbett , APR, Fellow PRSA and 2013 Chair and CEO of PRSA 
 Nick Kalm , President of Reputation Partners Public Relations 
 Chris Ruys , President of Chris Ruys Communications 
 R. J. Sirois , former PR pro turned successful real estate broker

 Lessons Learned: One Year Later 
 By Edward M. Bury (aka The PRDude) 
 Tomorrow will be more than Monday, July 7, the start of the work week after the long Independence Day holiday. 
 At least for me. 
 It's the anniversary of my first year in my terrific new position handling public affairs for a major research university here in Chicago. Working at an institution of higher learning, you might not be surprised to learn that I've learned quite a lot. 
 Here's what stands out: 
 1.   We Are Bound by the Quest for Knowledge.  Chicago can certainly hold its own as a truly global city. The same goes for the university where I work. Around one-third of the student body and faculty speak English as a second language. Regardless, the focus on our campus is on learning, progressing and growing. The atmosphere is supportive. The opportunities bound only by our drive and energies. Language and customs so far haven't come into play. 
 2. There are Nice, Cool People from Every Part of the World.  Over  the past year, I've made friends with smart people named Havan, Takanori and Moyin. They came to Chicago from parts of the world I've read about or gained insight from television, movies and online sources. Their goal is to learn and experience life in the United States, in the City of Chicago. I'm proud to call them my friends, and I'm eager to share what I know about the city. 
 **3. I 've Seen the Future of Communications and My Role In It. 
**And, frankly, the future is looking pretty good. My role within our research unit involves around eight specific responsibilities. Some skills, like website content development, social media management and how to plan large-scale event , I learned relatively recently. Others, like public relations strategies, project management and how to write effective, provocative copy, are skills I've built up over decades. Collectively, my skill set is an ideal fit for our research unit or any small to medium-sized company or organization. There will always be a market for communications professionals who can do a lot of things well. 
 What awaits in the next 12 months? 
 Watch this space and find out. As an Accredited PR professional, I'm bound to keep pace with the industry and learn. And, I couldn't think of a better place to do that than the place I'm at now.

 The Service of Self Alone: A Song for the Times 
 By Edward M. Bury, APR (aka The PRDude) 
 Yesterday, the citizens of Illinois (including this citizen) voted in  a primary election  for important statewide offices, including the office of governor. I won’t comment on the nominees from the two major parties, an incumbent populist who has a long career in public service and a political newcomer who made a fortune in the venture capital business. 
 I trust both have good intentions, and I believe both want to do what they  believe is needed to help Illinois rebound. 
 In listening to acceptance speeches last night, this was a common thread: Illinois needs jobs. The unemployment rate here,  currently at above 8 percent , is among the highest in the nation and the highest in the Midwest. 
 As regular followers know,  The PRDude blog  was started in 2009 as way to chronicle my search for “that next great job in public relations.” Along with commenting on “the lighter side of public relations, marketing, communications and other stuff,” I frequently comment on the employment market and what it’s like to seek work during these challenging economic times. 
 Below are lyrics for a song — you know I write songs, too, don’t you? — that was inspired by my most recent job search. The title is a line from  The Book of Common Prayer . 
 The Service of Self Alone 
 Save me, save me St. Theresa 
From the service of self alone 
Guide me, guide me to fulfillment 
Down the narrow pathway home 
 Chorus 
Righteousness and perseverance 
Brought me to the place I’m at 
Do you hear me St. Theresa? 
Should I sound a trumpet blast? 
 Watch me, watch me St. Theresa 
As I try another door 
Help me, help me knock the loudest 
Louder than the man before 
 Chorus 
 Refrain: 
Me and many, many others 
Are forced through no fault of our own 
To toil not for some wage or purpose 
In the service of self alone 
In the service of self alone 
 So help me, help me St. Theresa 
The weeks have turned to months again 
Give me give me hope and one good reason 
To carry on and not pretend 
 Copyright Edward M. Bury 2014 
 Hopefully, this song, which has a ska beat, will resonate with those who are seeking work. Hopefully, I won't be inspired to write a song like this again.

 New Advice for PR Graduates This May 
 By Edward M. Bury, APR (aka The PRDude) 
 One of the most visited of the 167 posts published by  The PRDude  graced the blagosphere around this time last year.  In the post , I offered graduates of college public relations programs some advice on how to establish themselves in the profession. 
 Offered were goals, strategies, objectives and tactics -- thoughts structured within classic components of an effective public relations plan. 
 And, I even made this offer: Reach out if you wanted any advice or direction. (For the record, I'm still waiting; but the offer stands.) 
 A year later, I'm a little older and hopefully a lot wiser. And, since I also am  searching for  that next great job in public relations , I've had time to think. Here are a few other thoughts, wisdom I'm passing down to public relations colleagues-to-be. 
 
 **Learn the Definition of "Public Relations." ** You'd be surprised at how many people out there in this great world -- some who claim to be "public relations professionals" -- still maintain that public relations is publicity. Or, "just like marketing." After all, it's easy to "get good PR." Right? This profession keeps evolving, largely through continual new directions on the digital front. But the fundamental purpose of public relations as a strategic means to communicate and build relationships has not changed.  Learn more from PRSA . 
 **Learn to Write (Beyond Tweets, Posts & Blogs). **It's been a long  time (hey, more than a long time) since I enrolled and completed a for-credit college course. So, I'm not sure if students today are required to take a semester of  English Composition 101  or some other fundamental writing course. My  101  instructor was a guy named Professor Brosnahan, a very strict proponent of the written word. He would scrawl a big red "F" on your composition for any error -- spelling, grammar, punctuation, syntax, logic. In this era of tweets, IMs and posts, the true public relations professional will have solid writing skills that transcend 140 characters. 
 PR = Business Practice = Not Free.  As a public relations ****professional, you 'll be required to manage event budgets, approve vendor expenses, price out media distribution services and many other tasks that require money. That's part of business, and public relations is a business. Furthermore, businesses are in business to make a profit; and, even non-profit associations with public relations departments run them like a business. Learn the business side of the industry and how to manage a spreadsheet. 
 
 One more thing: As noted, I've had an open door policy for those who want direction on public relations careers and opportunities. In the past year, I've fielded emails and a few calls. Only one guy actually followed up on the offer to meet. There's lots to be said about the desire to get out of the house. 
 Your thoughts?

 Reasons to be Cheerful, Parts 1, 2, 3 … 
 By Edward M. Bury, APR (aka The PRDude) 
 4, 5, 6. 
 And perhaps more reasons, many more. 
 As I continue with my next challenge -- finding that  next great job in public relations  (and/or a similar communications position) -- I decided to spend a few minutes on  this glorious spring Sunday in Chicago  taking stock of life as of today. 
 I was inspired by a song from the 1980s (remember that decade?) from a U.K. band called  Ian Dury and The Blockheads . The song in question is entitled  Reasons to be Cheerful .  It's kind of a sing-song composition featuring a rapid-fire recitation by Mr. Dury of  a few dozen, well, reasons to be cheerful . One could make an argument that Mr. Dury may have had some influence on the many forms of rap and hip hop, but that's the subject for another day and time. 
 
 The late Ian Dury, British band leader, artist and cultural icon. 
 __Mr. Dury, who fronted the band, certainly lived life on his own terms. This is illustrated by the image that accompanies this post. The Blockheads are probably best known for a tune -- _ Sex and Drugs and Rock and Rol l -- _that encapsulated reasons lots of people were cheerful in the 1980s, and probably are still today. 
 (NOTE: The PRDude is not endorsing or offering any commentary on sex, drugs or rock and roll at this time. Remember: This is a blog about public relations and "other stuff.") 
 Back to reasons to be cheerful, here are some to share: 
 1.  Support from Friends:  Since I began my current search for a new position, I've received dozens of messages and calls from old friends, new friends, online friends and family offering support and encouragement. 
 2.  Project Work:  In the past few weeks, I've landed some terrific writing assignments, including a major article on commercial real estate and assisting an organization develop and execute an effective social media strategy. 
 3.  APR Training:  Through my involvement with PRSA Chicago, I and a colleague are nurturing three local public relations colleagues on the process required to earn the Accreditation in Public Relations. We've held four classes and our candidates are really grasping what strategic public relations is all about. 
 4.  Blood Pressure Drop.  With more time to focus on my future and relax, my blood pressure has dropped to a "normal" 120 over 80. Plus, I've started to exercise more and cook healthy meals most nights for Susan and I. 
 5.  New Web Site Project:  You heard it here first: I'm in the process of launching a new web site that will let me pursue two of my passions: Online communications and enjoying a particular beverage that will remain nameless at the moment. Work is underway, and I'm projecting a late June unveiling. Stay tuned. 
 6.  The Future:  I'm optimistic about my future, the future of my city and our nation's future. (As for my beloved Chicago Cubs, I'd say "wait until next year AND the year after that.") The Labor Department just released  a favorable jobs report . While Chicago still has many problems, I think we're becoming more aware of ways to solve them. And, I sense that the President and Congress are ignoring the extremist views from both the right and left and want to meet on common ground. 
 I could add more, but six is plenty for now. 
 As for reasons not to be cheerful, I can't think of any. How about you?

 Crowdsourcing for Help on Public Relations Job Search Stragegic Plan 
 By Edward M. Bury, APR (aka The PRDude) 
 Visit  my web site  (for Edward M. Bury, APR, not  The PRDude ) and read my personal "tag line" of sorts: "A Modern Strategic Communicator Steeped in Old-School Traditions." The ****two key words from that passage to focus on for this post are "modern" and "strategic." 
 My plan to secure  that next great job in public relations  is based on sound strategies and will incorporate modern forms of communications when appropriate. 
 Crowdsourcing is one of those new online ways that's pretty simple in concept. And, apparently, it has worked. So, I'm trying it. For the uninitiated, here's a great definition of the concept: 
 "Simply defined, crowdsourcing represents the act of a company or institution taking a function once performed by employees and outsourcing it to an undefined (and generally large) network of people in the form of an open call. This can take the form of peer-production (when the job is performed collaboratively), but is also often undertaken by sole individuals. The crucial prerequisite is the use of the open call format and the large network of potential laborers." (Source: article by Jeff Howe, 2006  Wired Magazine .) 
 So, here's what I have in mind: Below is an outline for my plan to to land a new job in public relations. I'd like  to "crowdsource" replies and feedback from the blagosphere, and beyond should any alien beings have insight to share. 
 Without further ado, my plan. 
 Goal:  Secure a senior-level position in Chicago with a progressive company, agency or association where I'll be challenged to use my strategic public relations, communications and management skills to help realize a mission and build revenues. 
 Strategies:  Leverage my knowledge, skills and abilities in the B2B arena, with a concentration in the real estate industry. Accentuate my dedication to the public relations profession through volunteer work on behalf of  PRSA Chicago  and by one of 5,000 practitioners to hold the  Accreditation in Public Relations credential . Showcase my outstanding oral and written communication skills. 
 Objectives:  Secure at least five job or informational interviews monthly with decision-makers. Grow referral base to add at least two new sources monthly. Receive at least three job offers by August, 2013. 
 As for specific  tactics  , I'll hold off on sharing those until after I get some feedback from you. And, I know: that third  objective  is quite optimistic. But, hey, what's the alternative? To be pessimistic? That's not happening because I remain very confident that I have value in today's market. 
 Now it's your turn in this experiment. Let the crowdsourcing begin.

 Okay, Back to Work at Finding the Next Great Public Relations Job 
 By Edward M. Bury, APR (aka The PRDude) 
 A week has passed since I was compelled to take on the challenge of landing a new position where I can employ my  strategic public relations  knowledge, skills and abilities. Yes, it will be a challenge, but the hard things in life come with some sacrifice and require hard work. 
 Already, I've reached out to dozens of colleagues and friends, and already I've received many referrals and messages of support. That's tremendously gratifying, and I'm thrilled and honored to have such a tremendous network. I even picked up a small freelance assignment, and I'm willing to blog for food. (Just kidding! Have to keep a positive attitude, you know.) 
 During my last search -- the one that launched  The PRDude blog  and catapulted me into the  blogosphere  -- I learned a great deal about life, myself, public relations, digital communications, the value of networking and lots more. How long will it take to land that next great public relations job? Not sure, of course. 
 But  this announcement earlier today from the U.S. Department of Labor  certainly is encouraging: 
 
 The nation added 236,000 jobs in February, many more than economists predicted. 
 The national unemployment rate declined to 7.7 percent, the lowest since December 2008. 
 
 That's a direction the job market needs to go, and even  Wall Street continues to respond as the Dow charges ahead  and will surely end today on another record day of trading. 
 What are your thoughts on the employment market? Tell me in this very short poll: 
 Take Our Poll 
 I'll share results next week. Rest assured, I don't plan on competing with  the Gallup people . 
 If you are new to launching your own search for that next great job in public relations -- or another field -- I offer these pearls of wisdom: 
 
 Smile.  Find a reason to smile everyday. If you're reading this, you're probably better off than most of the world. 
 Help.  Ask for help, and offer it. You'll be surprised at how many people are will to assist you. 
 Meet.  Get out of the home office and meet people. Attend networking events. Volunteer. Join a group. 
 Integrity.  Never compromise your integrity for any reason. Period. 
 
 Okay. Breathe and exhale. Take on the next challenge. I plan to.

 A Q & A Conversation with Nick Kalm of Reputation Partners Public Relations 
 By Edward M. Bury, APR, aka The PRDude 
 Last month, The PRDude  published a post  that chronicled one of the highlights of his long (and hopefully influential and distinguished) career: Being featured in a question-and-answer blog published by a fellow blogger, public relations pro and best of all --  fellow dude . 
 Here, I take the role as the guy -- make that "dude" -- posing the questions. My interview subject is  Nick Kalm , founder and president of the Chicago-based  Reputation Partners Public Relations , a boutique firm that, well, here's what I harvested from their web site: "At Reputation Partners, we are trusted corporate reputation consultants who earn our clients’ trust by providing effective counsel, delivering the highest quality work and generating meaningful results." 
 The agency just celebrated its 10th anniversary, quite an accomplishment for any business in these ever-changing times. Here's an edited version of my conversation with Mr. Kalm. 
 1. Public relations can be a stressful way to make a living and is not for everyone. What compelled you to pursue public relations as a career? 
 I kind of backed into it at first. I was a political science major in college, and my career goal was to work in Washington for a Congressman or Senator. When I couldn't find a job in Washington, I returned to the New York City area and found a job in public relations working in the pharmaceutical industry. There really are a lot of similarities between public relations and working for the government. You have to reach a broad swath of the public and try to convince them to be in favor of something or against it. 
 2. After a very successful career at the nation 's largest independent public relations firm (Edelman), you decided to launch your own firm. What three reasons (or more, or less) prompted that decision? 
 At Edelman, I had a great career working on behalf of some very large multi-national public and private firms. I attended an event for entrepreneurs and was encouraged to start my own firm. I was 41 years old at the time, and said to myself, "If not now, when?" I knew I could always go back to the agency or corporate world. But, so far it's turned out great. 
 3. Say I 'm seeking PR counsel. Why would I select Reputation Partners over the firm down the street? 
 Clients go to big PR firms because they need strategic thinking and the depth and breath of experience those firms can offer. You can get that from Reputation Partners, but at a much more cost-effective rate. We provide the same level of services and are focused on delivering the same kind of results. We provide all of our clients with senior-level management attention. 
 4. The PRDude has been championing the practice of effective and ethical public relations. Do you believe our profession needs to do a better job of promoting good PR versus hucksterism? 
 It's a great question. I think there are many different kinds of public relations practices. Not to put what we do on a pedestal, but there are practitioners out there who aren't as ethical or of the same level of quality. There are a number of slippery characters in the business, and they're dragging down the entire profession. We're not defense attorneys. Companies don't have a right to PR counsel. There are some entities that should not be represented by public relations firms for ethical reasons. I see this happening at big and small firms alike: They tell the client what the want to hear and promise results they can't deliver. 
 5. Back in the day, there were lots of "PR legends," men (and some women) who pioneered the practice. Who's at the forefront of public relations today? 
 They really are few and far between. Earlier you mentioned  Edelman . I think  Richard Edelman  is one of the few intellectuals running a major PR firm. I can't think of anyone else who comes close. Ours is an industry that suffers from a big perception problem. I think there are few programs on college campuses that focus on public relations. Some colleges, of course are doing a good job preparing students for careers in public relations. We work in a very important profession that impacts people in their day-to-day lives in a very meaningful way. 
 Do you have questions for Mr. Kalm? Or The PRDude? Pose early and often.
