 There are many reasons people struggle to get a work-at-home telecommuting job. One is that they don't look for the  right jobs in the right places . Another is that they don't send a work at home job resume that stands out to employers. 
 How Can Your Resume Make or Break Your Telecommuting Job Search 
 Most people don't take the time to tweak their work at home resume to fit what the employer wants. Instead they send the same generic resume to every job announcement. If you've ever been on a a hiring committee, you know that these types of resume are not only boring, but are more likely to have you end up in a "possible hire" pile instead of "we need to talk to this person" pile. I hired a freelancer immediately after earmarking several possibilities because he  targeted his resume  to my needs. 
 
 What 's In a Winning Work At Home Job Resume? 
 It's important to understand that resumes are not boring documents that list your skills and experience.  They are marketing tools that sell you as the solution to the employer 's problem.  To do that, you need to match your skills and experience to directly meet the needs of the employer. Here's how: 
 
 What is the employer asking for? While most job announcements list an over all job title, such as "virtual assistant" or "customer service," in most cases, there are variations in what employers say they want or need in a worker. For example, they might want you have specific knowledge, experience, or equipment that other employers with the same job don't ask for. 
 What industry is the employer in. The more you can show an employer that you know and understand what he wants and needs, the more you'll stand out. By doing some research on the industry to understand what the company does and who it provides it to (what is the company's market), you can tailor your resume to show your knowledge of the industry. For example, if you want to be a virtual assistant and you see a job announcement from a Realtor, learn a little bit about the real estate industry so you can talk about how your skills work in real estate. 
 Highlight your skills and experience that fit the job in your resume and cover letter, with only a reference to non-job related work. Depending on your work history, you may have a ton of work experience that has nothing to do with the job you're applying too. Because you want to keep your resume to one page, you want to make sure you focus mostly on the skills and experience that the job needs, with only a mention of other experience. 
 Include a cover letter/email intro that focuses on your most qualified skills and experience. You have one chance to get an employer to look at your resume, so make sure you start off with a bang. 
 Use basic text for your resume and cover letter, especially if you'er pasting the information in an email or online. Formatting, such as bullets, bold, tabs, etc don't email or format online line well. If you're uploading or attaching a resume document (never attach a resume to email unless you're asked to), you can use formatting. 
 
 Work At Home Cover Letter/Resume Checklist 
 Now that you have an idea of what you need to do, here's how to do it. 
 
 Print out or write down the major skills and experience the job announcement asks for. If it wants a specific typing speed, write that down. If it wants a set number of years of experience, write it down. Note that you might not meet all requirements, but if you meet many of them, especially the important ones, you should be able to compete for the job. 
 Match your skills and experience to what the employer is asking for. If it wants someone who types 60 words a minute and you can do that, it's a match. 
 If you have experience in the same industry, that is a match. If you don't have experience in the industry, do a little research so you can at least write about it in your cover letter to show you understand what the company is about. 
 Note the name of the person you need to contact if it's provided.

 Emailing Your Work At Home Job Resume 
 Once you're ready to submit your resume, make sure your submission reaches the other end intact by sending it correctly. Emailing and copying/pasting into online forms can be tricky from a word processing program. You risk all sorts of things going wonky. Here is a video on how to prepare your resume for emailing or pasting online.

 In your resume,how did you omit unrelated experience without leaving a gap in dates? I have sporadic experience,how do I put that all together? 
 __Reply 
 1. [LTruex](http://www.workathomesuccess.com) says __5 years ago
 
 I wouldn't say omit experience, especially if it suggests a gap, but I'd focus on relevant experience and just have a line about other experience. For example, if I'm applying to a place focused on health and wellness, I provide a lot of info about my background in that, but only a line for each place I was a social worker, which didn't involve health and wellness. I hope that helps.

 Want To Know If EMPOWER Network Is a legit work at home opportunity.

 1. [LTruex](http://www.workathomesuccess.com) says __5 years ago
 
 My knowledge of the Empower Network is limited, although I know it's been around for a long time. I can't say that it's a scam, in that it's illegal or trying to steal your money. However, there are a few complaints regarding the program. Further, I'm not a big fan of these "sign up make money" programs. Working at home is like any other work. You should tap into skills, experience and interests you already have. Work-At-Home Success has tons of information and resources to help you find the right work-at-home option for you. Thank you for visiting WAHS!!
