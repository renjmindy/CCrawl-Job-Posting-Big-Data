 Hi all, 
 There is this expression, Feast or famine, meaning things are really good,  or things are really bad.. 
 This post is about the Feast part of the expression, as I can hardly keep up with all the job announcements in the last  two weeks! 
 Below is just a overview of each announcement at Cisco, SAP, Merit Medical and HP! 
 *Oranmore-based technology company Cisco Systems announced 
115 new jobs 
Check out the Cisco System Galway current vacancies  here  
 *100  jobs were announced at software giant SAP in 
Ballybrit 
Check out the opportunities at SAP Galway  here  
 *Merit Medical in Parkmore will be 
creating up to 300 new jobs at its new Merit Vision facility here as 
part of a â‚¬20m investment. I found  this page  where you can see all their vacancies worldwide 
 *Hewlett Packard (HP) 
will be building a new 90,000 square foot premises in Oranmore, which 
will cater for at least 200 extra staff, while around 100 jobs will be 
created in the construction phase. 
Check out their current vacancies  here  and select location Ireland, Galway 
 So if you are thinking to make your big move to Galway and looking for accommodation, I'd recommend  you check out  Daft  . There is also a  free local newspaper called The Galway Advertiser, which  comes out on a Thurday . You can view their online classifieds  here . 
 Please feel free to drop me a line if you have any questions you may have about living in Galway!
