 Fluffy sleeping this morning 
 I was laying in bed this morning with Fluffy laying across my side purring and settling down for a snooze, after her habitual 5 minutes of head butting, meowing at the top of her tiny lungs and demanding to be loved, and she got me wondering… She seems so relaxed and chilled and happy, I wonder if cats heads are full of the thoughts that we sometimes get overwhelmed with? 
 I had been snoozing and considering all the things I aim to achieve in my life, to have a successful clinic or four or five where I can help make a difference in many peoples lives, writing my own biography as its been a bit of an interesting ride to get me to where I am today, writing for others, expanding my business to include support in other more practical ways, the groups I am in the process of setting up and planning, what am I going to do with the most recently completed diploma in clinical weight loss, whether or nor my husband had got to work safely, what a beautiful day it is and how much I'd love to take the day off and sunbathe, planning my day which will mainly be designing my website, then focusing on my clients this afternoon and this evening, writing a shopping list in my head, deciding that myself and a friend would make the best Pinky and the Brain pair ever, being thankful that minions were created because they always make me smile, recollecting my evening last night when I got to spend it with my three closest friends, all of whom trained with me; contemplating all of our journeys that led to today from when we met in 2009, between us we have experienced divorce, breast cancer, two diagnoses of fibromyalgia, two weddings, the care and death of two of our mothers, new building businesses and closed building businesses, new love, numerous house moves, living with the after effects of chemo, new jobs and working with our new realities and counting myself blessed that I have such amazing friends and that we always provide unquestioning support and love with no expectations just pure love and friendship, and my personal favourite, how long before my legs start working enough for me to get up! as I am one of the two in our group with fibro……… 
 and Fluffy….. is she really just thinking about needing my love in the moment and is she really content just to lull herself to sleep to the sound of my heart beat as her purrs fall into pace with my breathing, or does she have a similar barrage of thoughts and feelings, I know one thing for sure, she never ever has a problem getting to sleep!
