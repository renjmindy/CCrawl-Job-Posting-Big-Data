 The only three true job interview questions are: 
 1. Can you do the job? 
 2. Will you love the job? 
 3. Can we tolerate working with you? 
 Anything else is just trying to get the answers to these. 
 The world's most popular job-search book is updated for 2013 to tailor its long-trusted guidance with up-to-the-minute information and advice for today's job-hunters and career-changers. Career expert Richard N. Bolles has written forty-one books all with the same title: What Color Is Your Parachute? A Practical Manual for Job-Hunters and Career-Changers. In order to tailor his authoritative guide to the current job- market, Bolles not only updates the book each year, but he also reconceives it, reinvents it, and rewrites it, so that one year's edition is often vastly different from the year before. This is the case with the 2013 edition. Inventions in the book this year include a brand-new transferable skills grid, a novel way to discover what fields you would most like to work in, and a revamped version of his famed self-inventory instrument, the Flower Exercise. What Color Is Your Parachute? is the world's most popular job-hunting guide, and it has helped millions discover their unique gifts, skills, and interests. This has allowed them to land a job even in hard times, and to create for themselves a new, interesting, and inspiring career and life. With fresh insights into resumes, networking, interviewing, salary negotiation, entrepreneurship, and social media, What Color Is Your Parachute? has everything you need to dust off your motivation and find your dream job. "From the Hardcover edition."
