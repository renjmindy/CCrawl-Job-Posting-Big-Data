 Calls for a 'commission of inquiry' into the impact of the government's changes to social security entitlements on poverty have won overwhelming support from Parliament. 
 The motion by Labour's Michael Meacher was passed with a massive majority of 123 votes; only two people - David Nuttall and Jacob Rees-Mogg - voted against it. 
 The debate enjoyed cross-party support, having been secured by Mr Meacher with Sir Peter Bottomley (Conservative) and John Hemming (Liberal Democrat). 
 Introducing the motion, Mr Meacher said: "It is clear that something terrible is happening across the face of Britain. We are seeing the return of absolute poverty, which has not existed in this country since the Victorian age more than a century ago. Absolute poverty is when people do not have the money to pay for even their most basic needs." 
 He said the evidence was all around: 
 
 There are at least 345 food banks and, according to the Trussell Trust, emergency food aid was given to 350,000 households for at least three days in the last year. 
 The Red Cross is setting up centres to help the destitute, just as it does in developing countries. 
 Even in prosperous areas like London, more than a quarter of the population is living in poverty. 
 According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, for the first time, the number of people in working families who are living in poverty, at 6.7 million, is greater than the number of people in workless and retired families who are living in poverty, at 6.3 million. 
 Child poverty will rise from 2.5 million to 3.2 million during this Parliament, around 24 per cent of children in the UK. By 2020, if the rise is not stopped, it will increase to four million - around 30 per cent of children in the UK. 
 The use of sanctions depriving people of all their benefits for several weeks at a time, had increased by 126 per cent since 2010 and 120 disabled people who had been receiving jobseeker’s allowance had been given a three-year fixed duration sanction in the previous year. 
 There are now more than 2,000 families who have been placed in emergency bed-and-breakfast accommodation after losing their homes. 
 The per cent rise in the overall homelessness figures last year included nearly 9,000 families with children, which is the equivalent of one family losing their home every 15 minutes. 
 A third of families spent less than £20 a week on food and that the average spend on food per person per day was precisely £2.10. That is a third less than those families were able to afford three months before that. 
 The proportion of households that had to make debt repayments of more than £40 a week had doubled and the average level of debt was £2,250. 
 A third of families had council tax debt. 
 2.7 million people had lost out through the Government’s changes to council tax benefit - many of them disabled people, veterans and some of the most vulnerable in our communities. 
 Households were having to spend 16 per cent more on gas and electricity. 
 There are 2.5 million people who have been unemployed for the best part of two years, and there were 562,000 vacancies when the debate took place (Monday), so four out of five of those who are unemployed simply cannot get a job whatever they do. 
 Cuts to local authorities mean many home care visits are limited to 15 minutes. 
 The 10 per cent of local authorities that are the most deprived in the country face cuts six times higher than those faced by the 10 per cent that are the most affluent. 
 60 per cent of benefit cuts fall on those who are in work. 
 
 Mr Meacher said the biggest cause of absolute poverty was the huge rise in sanctioning, often for trivial reasons such as turning up five minutes late for a job interview or the Work Programme: 
 
 A dyslexic person lost his Jobseekers Allowance because his condition meant that in one fortnightly period he applied for nine jobs, not 10. He was trying to pay his way and already had work, but it provided only an extremely low income. 
 The jobcentre didn’t record that a claimant had informed them that he was in hospital when he was due to attend an appointment and he was sanctioned. 
 A claimant went to a job interview instead of signing on at the jobcentre because the appointments clashed - and was sanctioned. 
 A claimant had to look after their mother who was severely disabled and very ill - and was sanctioned. 
 A Job Centre sent the letter informing a claimant of an interview to their previous address, despite having been told about the move. The claimant was sanctioned. 
 A claimant was refused a job because she was in a women’s refuge, fleeing domestic violence and in the process of relocating, but I was still sanctioned. 
 
 Mr Meacher also quoted what he called a classic:  “I didn’t do enough to find work in between finding work and starting the job.” 
 The latest DWP figures suggest that more than one million people have been sanctioned in the past 15 months and deprived of all benefit and all income. "Given that the penalties are out of all proportion to the triviality of many of the infringements, and given that, as I have said, four out of five people cannot get a job whatever they do, the use of sanctioning on this scale, with the result of utter destitution, is — one struggles for words — brutalising and profoundly unjust," said Mr Meacher. 
 Other reasons for the rise in absolute poverty included: 
 
 Delays in benefit payments. 
 The fact that it is impossible for many poor and vulnerable people to comply with new rules - for example a jobseeker who asked to downsize to a smaller flat who was told he must pay two weeks' full rent upfront before getting housing benefit. He does not have the funds to do so and is stuck in a situation where his benefits will not cover his outgoings due to the Bedroom Tax. 
 The Bedroom Tax, which applies to around 667,000 households, and two-thirds of those affected are disabled. More than 90 per cent of those affected do not have smaller social housing to move into. 
 The Benefit Cap, imposed on a further 33,000 households. 
 Mistakes by the authorities; up to 40,000 working-age tenants in social housing may have been improperly subjected to the Bedroom Tax because of DWP error (although Iain Duncan Smith claims a maximum of 5,000). 
 
 Mr Meacher said: "The Chancellor’s policy of keeping 2.5 million people unemployed makes it impossible for them to find work, even if there were employers who would be willing to take them, and the 40 per cent success rate of appeals shows how unfair the whole process is." 
 Responding to a comment from David TC Davies (Conservative) that those who are not looking for work must realise there will be consequences, particularly when a million people have been able to come to the UK from eastern Europe and find work, Mr Meacher said, "Those who come to this country are more likely to be employed and take out less in benefits than many of the indigenous population." 
 He asked: "Is all this brutality towards the poor really necessary? Is there any justification in intensifying the misery, as the Chancellor clearly intends, by winding up the social fund and, particularly, by imposing another £25 billion of cuts in the next Parliament, half of that from working-age benefits? 
 "After £80 billion of public spending cuts, with about £23 billion of cuts in this Parliament so far, the deficit has been reduced only at a glacial pace, from £118 billion in 2011 to £115 billion in 2012 and £111 billion in 2013. Frankly, the Chancellor is like one of those first world war generals who urged his men forward, over the top, in order to recover 300 yards of bombed-out ground, but lost 20,000 men in the process. How can it be justified to carry on imposing abject and unnecessary destitution on such a huge scale when the benefits in terms of deficit reduction are so small as to be almost derisory?" 
 Suggested alternatives to the punitive austerity programme of cuts came thick and fast during the debate. Challenged to explain what Labour's Front Bench meant by saying they would be tougher on welfare than the Tories, Mr Meacher said: "As the shadow Chancellor has made clear on many occasions, is that we need public investment. We need to get jobs and growth. That is the alternative way: public investment in jobs, industry, infrastructure and exports to grow the real economy, not the financial froth, because that would cut the deficit far faster than the Chancellor’s beloved austerity." 
 He asked: "How about the ultra-rich — Britain’s 1,000 richest citizens — contributing just a bit? Their current remuneration — I am talking about a fraction of the top 1 per cent — is £86,000 a week, which is 185 times the average wage. They received a windfall of more than £2,000 a week from the five per cent cut in the higher rate of income tax, and their wealth was recently estimated by  The Sunday Times  at nearly half a trillion pounds. Let us remember that we are talking about 1,000 people. Their asset gains since the 2009 crash have been calculated by the same source at about £190 billion. 
 "These persons, loaded with the riches of Midas, might perhaps be prevailed upon to contribute a minute fraction of their wealth in an acute national emergency, when one-sixth of the workforce earns less than the living wage and when one million people who cannot get a job are being deprived of all income by sanctioning and thereby being left utterly destitute. 
 "Charging the ultra-rich’s asset gains since 2009 to capital gains tax would raise more than the £25 billion that the Chancellor purports to need. I submit that it would introduce some semblance of democracy and social justice in this country if the Chancellor paid attention to this debate and thought deeply about what he is doing to our country and its people." 
 Ronnie Campbell (Blyth Valley, Lab) suggested that the Government might save a lot more if its members "showed the same energy and enthusiasm for getting those who evade their taxes and run to tax havens as they do for going after the poor, the sick and people on the dole". 
 Against this, David TC Davies offered insults and distortions of the facts, quoting the  Daily Mail  as though it provided an accurate account of current events: "Members of the shadow Cabinet might need a boxing referee to sort out their disputes at the moment, as we read today in the  Daily Mail ." 
 He said: "We took office with a deficit of £160 billion and a debt that was rising rapidly to £1 trillion. That was after years of overspending in good times, as well as in bad, by Labour, a cheap money supply and lax banking regulation under the former Government." Labour's spending, up until the financial crisis, was always less than that of the previous Conservative administration; Gordon Brown and Tony Blair both ran a lower deficit than John Major and Margaret Thatcher, and at one point actually achieved a surplus, which is something that the Conservatives had not managed in the previous 18 years. While Mr Davies here complained about the "lax banking regulation", Conservatives supported it at the time and in fact demanded more DE-regulation, which would have made the financial crisis worse when it happened. 
 "We had disastrous economic decisions, such as that to sell gold at a fraction of its real rate," said Mr Davies. Yes - the UK lost around £9 billion. But compare that with the disastrous economic decision by George Osborne to impose more than £80 billion worth of cuts to achieve a £7 billion cut in the national deficit. The UK has lost £73 billion there, over a three-year period. 
 And Mr Davies said: "Worst of all and most seriously, we had a welfare system that allowed people to get into a trap of welfare dependency, leaving them on the dole for many years, but at the same time filling the consequent gap in employment by allowing mass and uncontrolled immigration into this country, which completely undercut British workers." The first assertion is simply untrue; the second is a legacy of previous Conservative administrations that agreed to the free movement of EU member citizens, meaning that, when the eastern European countries joined in 2004, citizens migrated to the UK in the hope of a better life. Labour has admitted it should have negotiated for a delay in free movement until the economies of those countries had improved, making such migration less likely, but the situation was created before Labour took office. 
 Challenged on the Coalition's record, Mr Davies fell back on the Tories' current trick question, which is to counter any criticism by asking: "Is he suggesting that we are not doing enough to pay down the national debt? Is he suggesting that we should cut further and faster? If so, and if we had the support of other Opposition Members, that is exactly what the Government could do and, indeed, possibly should do. I look forward to seeing that support for getting the deficit down." This disingenuous nonsense was batted away by Labour's Hugh Bayley, who said "investing in the economy, creating jobs and thereby getting people off welfare and into work" was the way forward. 
 Mr Davies' Conservative colleague Jeremy Lefroy took a different view, agreeing that increasing numbers of people are finding it impossible to make ends meet, and that job creation and apprenticeships were a better way out of poverty than changing the social security system alone. He agreed that sanctions were applied to his constituents "in a rather arbitrary manner". He spoke against George Osborne's suggested plan to remove housing benefits from people aged under 25, saying this "would have a drastic impact on young people who need to live away from home and who have no support from their families". He spoke in favour of councils increasing their housing stock. And he admitted that disabled people faced severe problems when unfairly transferred from ESA to JSA: "A lady in my constituency says, 'I am simply not fit for work, but by signing on for JSA I have to say that I am available and fit for work.' She does not want to tell a lie." 
 Steve Rotheram (Liverpool Walton, Labour) spoke powerfully about the effect of being on benefits: "Lots of people in my city are on benefits for the very first time. Far from being in clover — it beggars belief what we read in the right-wing press — they are struggling to make ends meet, and the problem that thousands of Liverpudlians are facing is new to them. For many, the idea that they might miss a rent payment is totally alien. They have not done that in the past 20 years, but since May 2010, their individual household incomes have been on such a downward trajectory that they now find themselves in rent arrears, seeking advice on debt management and unable to afford the daily cost of travel, food and energy. Figures suggest that 40 per cent of the adult population in Liverpool are struggling with serious debt problems." 
 And he said poverty had health implications, too: "David Taylor-Robinson of the University of Liverpool and his fellow academics have highlighted the doubling of malnutrition-related hospital admissions nationally since 2008." 
 John Hemming (Birmingham Yardley, LD) raised concerns about "the interrelationship between the welfare cap and victims of domestic violence, and whether there are situations that need more attention. I believe that people can get discretionary housing payment to leave a violent home, but it is important that we ensure that there is a route out of domestic violence for women. I am worried about that issue, just as I am about some wrongful sanctioning that I have seen. That does not help at all, because it undermines the whole process." He also called for "a substantial increase in the minimum wage, because as the economy is improving the Government should look at that, rather than maintain things as they are". 
 The vote gave huge endorsement to the call for an independent inquiry into poverty under the Coalition. 
 But with an election just 15 months away, how long will we have to wait for it to report?

 Despair: How can you get the government to do the right thing when the rules mean it doesn't have to? 
 Those of you who read the comments on this blog will be familiar with Nick. He 's a gentleman who has been ill for a very long time. The effects of his illness are readily apparent just by looking at him - he describes himself as having the appearance of an inmate in a Japanese POW camp during World War Two. 
 The Department of Work and Pensions still wanted to tell him he was able to seek work; they only stopped trying to cut his benefits because his MP intervened. 
 This is how he describes the attitude of the Coalition government: "David Cameron … is not to be trusted as he has a way of killing people in a very barbaric way, the way of silence, in the privacy of one's home, to have a letter dropped on them to place that person in a deliberate panic, knowing and hoping it kills them." 
 Elsewhere, he states: "I myself have lost all my many online friends bar one… over the past three years -  all dead at the hands of the DWP ." 
 Now this government department is doing its best to starve the life out of Mrs Mike, it seems. 
 She received a letter yesterday that makes absolutely no sense at all, to anyone  with  sense. Attend: 
 " Please allow us to apologise for the lack of communication you have received regarding the changes in your benefit. As per normal procedure, you should have received a letter and phone call some weeks ago to prepare you for the end of your contribution based ESA claim. An invitation to claim income related ESA should then have been sent out. A fault on your claim meant that our processing section did not receive a prompt to contact you to explain the changes to contribution based ESA eligibility." 
 Our first reaction to that was:  Not our problem.  The "fault" on our claim would be one that was created at the DWP, by DWP employees, and is entirely the responsibility of the DWP. But who suffers for it?  We do . 
 " I can see that you have an ongoing appeal against being placed in the Work Related Activities Group of ESA. I cannot see an outcome to the appeal as of yet. Once an outcome has been reached, we will contact you. If successful, you will be placed in the Support Group of ESA." 
 The letter goes on to contradict itself, revealing that a decision-maker examined the appeal - in  April  - and determined that another work capability assessment would be necessary to find out whether Mrs Mike is less able to work now than she was in July last year. 
 We were not told about this decision.  We have not been notified about any new WCA. And now we are confused - are we supposed to be claiming income-related ESA, or waiting for the results of the appeal - an appeal which has been ongoing for nearly half a year now - in case Mrs Mike gets put into the support group.  And how is she supposed to live until then - on roots and berries? 
 " Please be aware that we receive a very high volume of appeals; due to the volume, it is not possible to resolve each appeal as quickly as we or our ESA claimants would like. However, please be assured that your appeal is ongoing and you will be contacted when we have an outcome. In your case, our Decision Maker has stated that we will need to know the outcome of your next medical assessment before we can progress your appeal." 
 Yes, we are indeed aware that the DWP receives a very high volume of appeals -  255,084 between January and March. The cost of these appeals to the taxpayer totalled £66 million between 2012-13  - and that it is  losing  them in increasing numbers. This is because Atos assessors and DWP decision-makers have been making decisions that are not only wrong according to the law but harmful to the lives of those affected.  Do I really need to quote the 73-deaths-per-week figure that we all know and loathe - and that we all believe has inflated to even more horrific levels since it was first released?  We don't know because the DWP - again - is refusing to release the figures it holds. 
 " When you were migrated across to ESA from Incapacity Benefit, you attended a medical for ESA reassessment. The outcome of this was that you were to be placed in the Work Related Activities Group for a period of 12 months, effective from 21.06.12. It is for this reason that you were sent an ESA50 form in May this year; you were due for your 12month review, as stated when your claim was migrated from IB to ESA." 
 This is what we deduced when we received the form - which arrived with no explanatory letter. We completed it and sent it back very quickly and had heard nothing about it since. It would be logical to expect a response, or indeed a decision,  before  a benefit claim expired, but we're dealing with the DWP here, whose agents seem to think they are a law unto themselves. 
 Note the two inaccuracies: Mrs Mike's ESA started on August 14 last year, and the Work Capability Assessment is  not  a medical check and should not, in any circumstances, be described as one.  It is a tick-box assessment to determine whether a claimant is capable of performing any work that may be used by the DWP as an excuse to close their claim.  Nothing more. 
 "Your completed ESA50 has been received by ATOS; we are currently waiting for them to set a date for your new medical assessment. You will be contacted when this date has been set." 
 Oh, so the fault lies with Atos, does it? That's nice to know. In the meantime,  what are we supposed to be using to pay the bills? 
 And has anyone noticed that we now have a choice between combinations of three ongoing matters: We can make a new claim for income-related ESA; we can wait for a decision on our appeal, which requires another work capability assessment; and/or we can wait for Atos to pull its finger out of whichever bodily orifice is appropriate and arrange a WCA in relation to the 12-month review, which is also awaiting a decision - all  after  the claim period has ended! 
 Will we have to attend  two  work capability assessments? That seems to be what's implied, although nothing in the letter clarifies this. 
 " I have referred your letter of complaint to our Complaints Resolution Manager, for their response. I do appreciate that you have not experienced the level of communication or customer care that we seek to provide. 
 " Hopefully this answers your queries." 
 How  has this answered any queries? All it has done is create more questions! 
 " Once you have completed and returned the enclosed ESA3 form, we will be able to reassess your claim and consider income related ESA. 
 " Once you have been seen for your next medical, we will be able to progress your Support Group appeal. If placed in Support Group, it is possible that we will be able to recommence payment of contribution based ESA." 
 Aren't these mutually exclusive? Which do they expect us to do? And -  again  - how do they expect us to live while we're doing this and waiting for them to get on with it? 
 Note that there is no mention that we can apply for a Short Term Benefit Advance while waiting for the DWP to fulfil its responsibilities. Few people know about this and the Department aims to keep it that way.  Why 's that , do you think? 
 It is well-known to the DWP that, along with her physical problems, Mrs Mike suffers from mental health problems and depression. As I write these words, she's asleep on the sofa where she has been bawling her eyes out for much of the morning, in utter despair at the situation. That's the same sofa where she spends many days at a time in such agony that she cannot move. 
 She won't be another casualty of this institutionalised cruelty, but now  I  have to be extra vigilant to make sure she doesn't get low enough to do herself a mischief. That's an extra burden on me, when I already have my hands full, running the household and trying to find ways to make ends meet (like the  Vox Political  book,  Strong Words and Hard Times  *). 
 Meanwhile, what sanctions have been placed upon the DWP officers who have been working on this case? 
 None at all. 
 Everyone knows unemployed people claiming Jobseekers Allowance have to sign a 'Jobseekers Agreement' in which they agree to meet stringent conditions in order to receive their benefit. In the same way, people on ESA must report changes in their own circumstances and medical health, in order to allow their benefit to be updated correctly. Both arrangements rely on correct and timely administration by the DWP. 
 But this is not happening - nor is it likely to happen in the future - because, when you check to find what sanctions may be placed on the DWP for failing to uphold its side of the agreement, what do you find? 
 None at all. 
 Of course, responsibility for the policy lies not with those who carry it out but with the policy-  maker  , in this case the Secretary of State, Iain Something Smith. How much will he pay as a penalty for masterminding this failure of a system that has caused so much agony to so many people - and that is costing the taxpayer so much extra money in legal challenges? 
 I'll tell you. It's exactly the same as the amount of remorse the failed, Returned-To-Unit Army bag-carrier showed when he was challenged about the people his policies have killed: 
 None at all. 
 There will be no hope for the sick and disabled of this country until those responsible for their persecution are made to pay the price for it.

 Ed Miliband on the Workfare Bill - we've heard it all before

 Miliband and Byrne: They did the wrong thing, but was it for the right reasons? 
 A whole week after the crucial confidence-breaking vote on the Bill that gives Iain Duncan Smith retroactive powers to steal benefits from jobseekers, an email appears "from the office of Ed Miliband". 
 Here's what it said: 
 "Thank you for contacting Mr Miliband about the Jobseekers Bill and my apologies for the delay in replying. 
 "We know how strongly many people feel about this and that you are disappointed that Labour decided to abstain. 
 "Please be assured that we looked very carefully at all the points raised but in the end the vote came down to the question of whether the DWP should have any legal power whatsoever to stop benefits for people who won’t try to find work at all. 
 "With record levels of young people out of work, we believe young people must be offered a real choice of a real job with real wages. That’s why Labour is moving amendments to the Bill to demand a tax on bankers’ bonuses to fund over 100,000 jobs for young people with pay at the national minimum wage and training. 
 "Our approach is completely different to the government. 
 "We would guarantee everyone unemployed for over two years a properly-paid job, but we want it to apply to young people after a year. In return, we think most people would agree that people would be obliged to take up those jobs or face losing benefits. 
 "These powers have always existed; for example, in Labour’s Future Jobs Fund, if a young person didn’t take the offer of a job, they would have faced having benefits halted. Labour’s New Deal operated on the same principle. 
 "We would not support a retrospective bill driven through Parliament at lightning speed – and Labour demanded two crucial concessions, which we forced the government to make. 
 "First, appeal rights must be guaranteed so that others can appeal against mistakes made by the DWP. We can’t have carte blanche retrospective legalisation of sanctions. 
 "Second, there must be an independent review of the sanctions regime, with an urgent report and recommendations to Parliament. 
 "While you may not agree with the decision to abstain, we hope you can recognise that the points you and others have raised were carefully considered and the safeguards Labour have secured. 
 "Thank you again for taking the time to contact Mr Miliband on this important issue." 
 It 's not good enough, is it? 
 Miliband - and Liam Byrne, Stephen Timms, and all the rest of the current Labour team - need to realise that there is a fundamental difference between what they supported and what they  say  they want. They should have held out for the latter. 
 The Coalition government's scheme puts people to work - for employers who are perfectly capable of paying not only minimum wage but the living wage, for an indefinite period of time, to a person who used to be defined as a paid employee - for,  and this is the important part  ,  no remuneration other than their Jobseekers ' Allowance . 
 Contrast that with what Labour offered in the past - "in Labour’s Future Jobs Fund, if a young person didn’t take  the offer of a job  , they would have faced having benefits halted. Labour’s New Deal operated  on the same principle  " - and what Labour says it would offer in the future - "we believe young people must be offered  a real choice of a real job with real wages  ". 
 Why put up with anything less? 
 The concessions are paper tigers - it is understood that appeal rights were enshrined in the original legislation and we have seen no evidence that they were ever going to be dropped, while the timetable of the proposed independent review is such that the current Secretary of State for Work and Pensions may never have to act on it. 
 In other words, Labour let the Coalition run roughshod over the rule of law - for nothing.

 Faces of betrayal: Are Ed Miliband and his work and pensions spokesman Liam Byrne about to engineer the biggest betrayal of working class people in Labour Party history? If so, how do they think they will ever be able to win an election? 
 Last night I read a news report that, if true, shocked me to my core. 
 Headlined  DWP seeks law change to avoid benefit repayments after Poundland ruling , the  Guardian  article made the following statements: 
 "The Department for Work and Pensions has introduced emergency legislation to reverse the outcome of a court of appeal decision and "protect the national economy" from a £130m payout to jobseekers deemed to have been unlawfully punished. 
 "The retroactive legislation, published on Thursday evening and expected to be rushed through parliament on Tuesday, will effectively strike down a decision by three senior judges and deny benefit claimants an average payout of between £530 and £570 each." 
 It said lawyers and campaigners have branded the DWP's move as "repugnant" and "unbelievably disgusting", saying it undermined the rule of law. That is my belief, also. 
 Then came the hammer blow: 
 "The Guardian understands that  Labour will support the fast-tracked bill  with some further safeguards and that negotiations with the coalition are ongoing." 
 What? 
 Labour, supporting a Bill by the Tories, specifically designed to oppress people who are in work or trying to find work? 
 This would be a betrayal of Labour 's core support and is something that, in my belief, nobody who supports the rule of law in this country should tolerate. 
 Allow me to put this into perspective: 
 The Court of Appeal ruling means that the Department for Work and Pensions, under Iain Duncan Smith's supervision, broke the law more than 228,000 times. That is the number of jobseekers from whom they have deprived benefit, according to the figures available. IDS is a criminal a quarter of a million times over. 
 Not only that, but the Workfare programme, by making people work for employers who are perfectly capable of hiring people at the minimum wage or for higher amounts, is taking real jobs out of the economy - something that the Labour Party must abhore (the clue is in the title - 'Labour' Party). 
 There can be no justification for it. 
 The electorate will never forgive the party if Labour turns on its core voters - the poor and vulnerable - and attacks them in this way. 
 It is an absolute and certain path to defeat at the next election. 
 The only reasonable way forward is to fight tooth and nail against this evil subversion of the legislative process. 
 Just scan the responses to this article on the Labour Party's Facebook page and the  Guardian  article's comment column and you will see that (to the best of my ability to judge)  nobody  who has professed support for Labour  has expressed support for this . 
 Not one person. 
 The response has been universally negative.  Nobody wants Labour to do this. 
 Now, it could be that this is all a mistake and the  Guardian  article (by Shiv Malik) contains information that is wrong. 
 But I, and others, have been trying to get a response from the Labour leadership for nearly 24 hours now, to no avail.  It seems - whatever their convictions - these MPs don't have the courage to stand by them. 
 The new Bill is being rushed through Parliament and there will be a vote on Tuesday, so you may well be asking what is to be done. 
 The immediate thing to do is, if you are a Labour supporter and have a Labour MP -  CONTACT THEM . Telephone them, email them, get to them whichever way you can. Make it clear, politely but in no uncertain terms, that supporting Iain Duncan Smith's evil Bill is a betrayal of the people who support the party and that you will not tolerate it. 
 PRESSURE. It 's the only way to ensure the will of the people is heard. 
 Meanwhile, some of us will explore other avenues. 
 We'll get to the bottom of this. 
 What a shame this shot in the foot had to happen just when support for David Cameron and the Coalition has been crumbling. It really is an abomination. My opinion is that those responsible should be ejected from the Labour Party altogether.

 Iain Duncan Smith's shirkers and scroungers: Soldiers, teachers and nurses

 David Cameron, pictured in the Telegraph article: "I want to go on," he says, neglecting to add, "harming the honest, the hard-working, the strivers and the tryers of the UK. I want to go on rewarding the tax-dodgers, the bankers, the exploiters and Parliamentary scroungers. I want to go on deceiving the easily-led into believing that my way is the only way, and duping my Coalition partners into supporting my extreme right-wing policies until I can sling them into the gutter in 2015". Does that seem about right to you? 
 Apparently 'Compassionate Conservatism' doesn't extend to people in certain professions. 
 According to a new analysis by The Children's Society published in  The Observer  , almost half a million soldiers, teachers and nurses will lose hundreds of pounds every year when the Coalition's latest benefit cut comes into force. 
 The cap of one per cent on benefit and tax credits upratings over the next three years means up to 40,000 soldiers will be worse-off: A second lieutenant in the army with three children, earning £470 a week and whose wife does not work will lose £552 per year. 
 Around 150,000 primary and nursery school teachers will lose out: A couple with two children where the sole earner is a primary school teacher earning £600 per week will lose £424. 
 But the majority of losers in the professions will be nurses - 300,000 of them. A lone-parent nurse with two children, earning the profession's average of £530 per week, will lose £424 per year. 
 For a government that likes to state "We love the NHS", the Coalition seems to really enjoy attacking nurses and trying to cover it up. By December 13 last year, 7,134 nursing posts had been lost since the Coalition came into power, 943 in the previous month alone. But when the issue was raised in Parliamentary debate, Health Secretary and gynaecological slang-term Jeremy Hunt did his level best to avoid giving a straight response. “The nurse to bed ratio has gone up. The average bed is getting an extra two hours of nursing care, per week, than under Labour.” That didn't tell us how many nurses had lost their jobs. So we got: “The number of clinical staff in the NHS has gone up and not down. I don’t want to micro-manage every hospital in the country and tell them how many doctors and how many nurses.” 
 Perhaps there's some deep-seated childhood trauma affected all the members of the Coalition government, that makes them want to persecute nurses and then try to cover it up? Whatever the case, I'm sure the facts would form the skeleton of a terrific little crime thriller. 
 Don't be fooled by the fact that the government will be debating an  increase  of one per cent in benefits this year. With inflation at 2.7 or 3.2 per cent, depending on which system you use, that's a real-terms  cut  of two per cent every year for the next three years. 
 I'd like to draw your attention to the fact that these figures were compiled by The Children's Society, meaning they relate only to working parents.  The one per cent cap on benefit rises will hit single working people as well - we just don't have the figures for them yet. 
 The figures make a nonsense of Iain Duncan Smith's increasingly desperate claims that his policy of cuts and persecution to achieve lower take-up of welfare benefits is fair. 
 The Tories have now alienated working people and those on benefits. Who 's next, do you think? I reckon pensioners had better prepare for the worst! 
 Remember last week, when he trotted out a roll of fabricated figures to make it seem that the tax credit system had run out of control under Labour (tax credits are among the benefits to be capped at one per cent)? It turns out that  all his figures were wrong  , with his claims about fraud - which stands at less than one per cent of total claims - spectacularly inaccurate. 
 How about the very next day, when he was dribbling about the relative percentage rises in Jobseekers' Allowance and private sector salaries, claiming that the unemployed were getting a far better deal than workers - only to be rebuffed when we all checked how much this was in real money, found out that workers were still making far more (although not enough - remember many employers pay so little that people working full-time still have to claim state benefits, so that's a subsidy for private companies, being paid out of our taxes).  The amount paid in benefits as a proportion of average wages has stayed the same, as it should. The Work and Pensions Secretary is hell-bent on breaking that link in order to inflict real harm on Britain 's poorest. 
 Does anybody remember the Tory slogan "Broken Britain"? What they didn't tell us was that they were the ones who wanted to break us! 
 And now David Cameron has told the  Telegraph  he wants to be Prime Minister for another full term, from 2015 to 2020. If he manages that feat, he will no doubt face pressure from some of his own cabinet members to inflict further harm on those receiving benefits. 
 For example, a group of 70 Tory MPs including Michael Gove and David Willetts have published an agenda of policies that one minister has already - according to the Torygraph - described as a "blueprint" for the party's next general election manifesto. 
 It includes plans to lengthen the school day "to help working parents" - how do you like that, all you teachers who are losing benefits this year? You can rest assured that your pay won't increase to cover the extra hours! 
 And it calls for benefits to be cut for people who live in the North, and other parts of the country where the cost of living is lower. They love regional pay, don't they? And they WILL drive it through, no matter how much of the population oppose it! 
 For a representative selection of citizens' opinions about this, I suggest you  visit the MSN news site's version of this story  where (when I looked last night) the Comment column was unanimously opposed to Cameron continuing. That's something like 20-odd pages of people demanding that he be ousted at the first opportunity. 
 It did my heart good to see that. 
 The sad truth is that none of the above will change the result of the debate and vote on benefits uprating, due to take place in the House of Commons on Tuesday. 
 As long as the Tories have the support of Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats, they have a majority and can vote through any ludicrous and harmful policies they please. 
 The only thing I can suggest is that you all email your MPs in advance of the debate and put pressure on them to do the right thing - or account for their decision if they vote with the government - especially if you live in the North, or in rural areas!

 Getting the PIP: concerns about the DLA replacement

 Is anybody else concerned about aspects of the DWP 's replacement for Disability Living Allowance? 
 It seems to me that some parts of it are deeply questionable. 
 Firstly: The fact that you have to phone up for a claim form. The person on the other end of the 0800 number will ask "general" questions - including very specific details of your bank account.  What? Your  bank account ?  That's right. They want your bank details before anything else happens. 
 Now this makes me extremely suspicious. We've only just had the furore over Universal Jobmatch, the DWP website that jobseekers are being coerced into using, where any bogus 'company' can put on an advert and demand enough details to commit identity theft - now the same government organisation wants the bank details of disabled people!  We don 't know who's answering the phone  - is it a trustworthy government employee or a subcontractor? Knowing the Coalition government as well as we do, there's no reason to give them any trust at all. 
 Next: The form will go to a health professional working for the company Capita (in Wales) or our old sparring-partner Atos in other parts of the UK. They may decide a claimant's entitlement straight away, but most will be asked to attend a face-to-face interview. It is possible that home visits may take place if the need presents itself. Attendance with a friend, relative, partner, health professional or similar is encouraged. All evidence will be reviewed and a report will be sent to the Department for Work and Pensions to make a decision.  The health professional will not make any recommendations at all - a DWP case manager will review the evidence and make a decision. 
 Do we believe that? Could it be a reaction to the revelation last summer that DWP officers were rubber-stamping recommendations from Atos assessors about Employment and Support Allowance claimants? Is the DWP trying to - as it were - head us off at the pass? I'm not ready to believe this and I can't recommend that anyone else should either. 
 Finally, as part of the ongoing process, questions and replies about PIP will be posted on the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page of the DWP's PIP website,  www.dwp.gov.uk/pip  - which is fine, if you're a disabled person with access to the Internet. Many parts of Wales are still broadband "not-spots", and I'm sure that goes for parts of the other UK countries also. What do people do if they live there? Suffer in ignorance? 
 Are you affected by this? What do you think?  According to the DWP, "the general feeling is that PIP is outdated".  Do you agree?  If not, why do you think the department has made that claim? 
 Here's a little more information about PIP, and the process of conversion from DLA to the new system: 
 On April 8, 2013, PIP replaces DLA. There are similarities - PIP maintains links to passported benefits where possible, and there are special rules for claimants who are terminally ill. The differences are that claimants must have still have their problem nine months after they apply; there will be planned interventions and an early reconsideration process. 
 From April 2013, new claims for PIP will be taken in the northeast and parts of northwest England; it won't affect other regions until June. 
 From October 2013, claimants on fixed period awards that are coming up for renewal will be reassessed, along with young people coming up to age 16, and indefinite awards with a change of circumstances. Nobody else will be reassessed until October 2015. 
 For those with fluctuating conditions, the form will provide an opportunity to explain them (I have no information on how that will work). 
 Claimants can have help completing the form, and reports from health professionals such as occupational therapists and doctors may be added to it. 
 If a claim is disallowed or reduced, they will phone on three separate dates, at three separate times, to explain the decision. There are concerns that claimants with particular issues such as mental health problems might not understand.

 The work programme - a £527 million failure 
 [ 
 27   Tuesday  Nov 2012

 The government 's flagship work programme stood revealed as an abject failure today, when the Department for Work and Pensions admitted only around three per cent of jobseekers have found "sustainable" work. 
 Of the 878,000 people who joined the programme, only 31,000 found a job for six months or more. 
 The figures mean as many unemployed people are finding sustainable jobs on their own - and are staying in employment six months after joining the work programme - than if the scheme had never existed. 
 There was "no direct evidence of movement into sustained employment". 
 Ministers have, of course, refused to accept that the scheme is a failure - despite it reaching only three-fifths of its 5.5 per cent target (3.53 per cent) - and are claiming it is taking longer than expected to succeed. The next set of figures will be better, they claim. They said it was "early days". 
 We should bear in mind that  three top officials on the work programme resigned  recently, before the results were released. Oh, and the figures aren't for a year but for 14 months, from June 2011 to July 2012.  Cooking the books? 
 Under the scheme - replacing the New Deal, Employment Zones and Pathways to Work - approved providers in England, Scotland and Wales - mostly private companies - try to find work for claimants on a payment-by-results basis. In practice they get paid per referral, with more cash coming to them for providing 'work-related activities'. 
 According to  Vox  readers, the contract is outsourced to our good friend SERCO, which is then supposed to pass money on to six different agencies. There is a question mark hanging over whether that has actually happened. 
 Providers can earn between £3,700 and £13,700 per person helped into work, depending how hard it is to give support to an individual, with an initial payment of between £400 and £600. 
 Again,  Vox  readers have helped with the details: "The few hours spent on 'work related activities’ cost the taxpayer another £200 per person. 
 "What did we do on this ‘course’? We drew graphs with our barriers to employment. No one was allowed to mention lack of jobs and no training. We also played silly games: the one in which everyone had to say three things about themselves and everyone had to guess the lie. We all drew a pig. If it’s facing forward you are a straightforward person. The ‘ teacher ‘ told us that this all came from some American psychologist. It looked more like one of those quizzes in  Cosmopolitan ." 
 So we can see that, with hundreds of thousands of people being put on the work programme but only 31,000 actually finding sustainable work,  the big winners are, as this site suggested previously, the private companies contracted to provide the service at up to £600 per referral plus £200 for the 'activities' themselves . And if the rumours are correct, even these firms are losing out because SERCO hasn't released the cash. 
 It may interest you to know that 878,000 (the number of people referred to the scheme) multiplied by £600 (the minimum amount we can say was given to private companies for them) is a whopping  £526,800,000! 
 This site reported previously that the number of people being referred to the work programme has dropped dramatically, with total monthly referrals in July fewer than 49,000 – less than half of the 100,000 who were put on the controversial scheme in July 2011. 
 The number of long-term Jobseekers’ Allowance claimants had risen by 188,000 during the same period.

 Iain Duncan Smith's Question Time lies exposed

 Get your jobs here: They won't pay, they won't last, and you'll probably be signing on again within six months. 
 I bet Iain Duncan Smith was praying nobody would produce any statistics disproving his rant at Owen Jones during the BBC's  Question Time  last week . 
 Some of us were praying for the opposite, and it turns out that  our  God is quicker than his. 
 I know the new report released today (Monday) by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, showing that  more working people are living in poverty  , will be just another document that the UK government will blithely ignore. 
 But some of its findings bite deeply into Department for Work and Pensions policy, and the claims of the man who runs that department. 
 For starters, in 2012, 18 per cent of working-age households were workless, but in only two per cent of households had nobody ever worked. More than half of adults in 'never-worked' households were under 25. 
 Therefore, when Iain Duncan Smith told Owen Jones on Question Time last week, "I didn’t hear you screaming about two and a half million people who were parked, nobody saw them, for over 10 years, not working, no hope, no aspiration,"  he was spouting false information . Two per cent of the population is not two and a half million people, and under-25s cannot have been unemployed for more than 10 years. 
 The report,  Monitoring poverty and social exclusion 2012  , makes it clear that the proportion of 'never-worked' households has increased recently - most particularly since the current government came into power? -  and is most likely a manifestation of high and rising young adult unemployment rather than a fixed number of people "parked" on the dole . 
 We all know that a million young people aged 16-24 were unemployed in the first half of 2012. 
 There is a weakness in how the Government has assessed the impact of welfare changes, by looking at them individually rather than as a whole  , the report states. The Department for Work and Pensions' impact assessments show that some benefit changes will produce large cuts for tens of thousands (such as the total benefit cap for workless households), and some will produce small cuts for hundreds of thousands (for example lowering the amount of local housing allowance claimable). But some households, mostly already in low income, will be hit more than once through cuts to both housing-related and non-housing, income-related benefits. 
 One reform is to replace Disability Living Allowance (designed to meet the actual costs of living with a disability) with the Personal Independence Payment, cutting the caseload by 20 per cent. But disabled people are more likely to be workless, so may have other benefits cut as well. 
 Government ministers have spent months telling us that their benefit reforms mean work will always pay; but the report makes one thing perfectly clear:  It doesn 't .  More than half of children and working-age adults in poverty live in a working household. 
 So what are they achieving by depressing benefit payments, other than condemning those who rely on state payments, who have paid into state systems throughout their working lives, and who have reason to expect those systems to support them during hardship, to destitution, health risks and possibly death (for reasons explored in other articles on this blog)? 
 Not a lot. 
 " The 'low-pay, no-pay' jobs market keeps millions in poverty and holds the economy back,"  states the Joseph Rowntree Foundation report. ** "Work should always be a route out of poverty but it is not. Changing the benefits system will not solve problems such as in-work poverty, increasing underemployment and rising health inequalities."** 
 It states that 6.1 million working households are in poverty, so  in-work poverty now exceeds workless poverty  , which stands at 5.1 million households. That's 11.2 million households - family groups - earning below 60 per cent of average income.  Could that mean maybe a third of the total population is in poverty, due to current government policies? 
 The proportion of working age adults without children in poverty has risen steadily, from seven per cent in 1981 to 20 per cent in 2010/11. The number of working-age adults in low-income, in-work households has also increased. As pensioner poverty is now at low levels,  the rate of in-work poverty is the most distinctive characteristic of poverty today . 
 Of those in work, 6.4 million lack the work they want. There are 1.4 million part-time workers who actually want full-time work.  This is the highest figure in 20 years.  You won't hear a government representative talking about this when they trumpet their latest employment figures, and it's always up to the news organisations to sift out how many jobs are part-time. 
 Only 18 per cent of people are said to be in low income at any one time - but  an entire third of the population experience at least one period of low income within any four-year period  ; 11 per cent are in low income for more than half of that time. 
 Poverty is no longer concentrated in the social rented sector - people who bought their houses, thinking their wages would be able to support this, have been proved wrong as salaries have tumbled. 
 The number of underemployed people in the first half of 2012 was 6.4 million, comprising unemployed people (2.6 million); economically inactive people who want work (2.4 million); and people working part-time because they cannot find full-time work (1.4 million). Underemployment increased since 2009 due to a rise of 500,000 in the number of people working part-time but wanting full-time work. 
 Most jobs are short-term now  ; around 42 per cent of Jobseekers' Allowance claims from the first quarter of 2012 were made within six months of a previous claim. 
 Unemployment has remained static in the last three years - despite government claims - because employees have been willing to take fewer hours. This means  they have accepted less work, and therefore less pay, in order to keep their jobs . How does the government reconcile that with its claim that it is making work pay? 
 Real people, experiencing these real deprivations, have a different view. As Jane Walters commented on a different article in this blog: "Employers … are making huge profits out of paying people less wages than they need to live on." 
 Oh, and even though the disabled are more likely to be out of work than able-bodied people,  more disabled people were in work than in the past . Considering the way the government has painted the disabled as workshy scroungers since it came into office, I believe the appropriate expression is  " That's really p*ssed on Iain Duncan Smith's chips" .

 New threat to UK economy as Calamity George vows to give it "110 per cent"

 According to the  Telegraph  , George Osborne has promised that the Coalition will give "110 per cent attention" to boosting the economy after the Bank of England admitted there will be no growth at all this year. 
 He's like a child trying to appease Mum and Dad: "I'm sorry we've got nothing to show for the last two years but we'll give it 110 per cent from now on!" 
 I have a doubt about that. Not about his sincerity; about his ability. 
 He says he's got the deficit down - but did he do it in the right way? I suspect the thousands of disabled benefit claimants who've lost their benefits in the Atos* debacle would say no -  as, I 'm sure, would all those who committed suicide  because they could see no way to carry on living after the DWP cut them off, on advice from Atos.  That 's not good government - that's oppression . 
 The tens of thousands of jobseekers who were unfairly cut off from their benefits because  the DWP 's correspondence about Workfare was badly written  would probably have something to say about this as well. Not only is the correspondence bad but  Workfare itself is oppressive to the jobseeker and terrible for the economy ! It makes no economic sense at all to supply businesses with workers for free when they should be taking on employees to do the job and paying them a living wage - part of which would then come back to the Treasury in taxes, boosting the economy and reducing national debt at the same time. 
 It is clear that  the "austerity" agenda has done nothing for the economy . That's no surprise. If you cut the money going into a project - be it a business concern or a public service - you'll have cash left over, sure - but you won't have made any profit; you'll have made a saving. The two things are not the same and  you can 't build the economy by saving money . In fact, as far as both business and public services are concerned,  you 're dismantling the very machinery you need, in order to rebuild ! 
 Finally, perhaps somebody could explain to me why the Bank of England has been so obsessed with Quanititative Easing? As far as I can tell,  all this has done is provide the banks with billions of pounds of free money . What have they done with it all? They're not lending it, as intended. My understanding was that the money has been used to buy big houses in, is it Portland Street? And on fixing up those houses. I'm willing to stand corrected on that if anyone knows better and the point is that the only organisations that have benefited from the money are the banks themselves -  the very organisations that caused the economic mess in the first place  (carry on about Labour's lack of regulation if you like but the bare fact is that the bankers all made their own choices and it turned out that those choices were wrong). 
 According to the  Telegraph  , George Osborne's going to give the economy 110 per cent. If it  improves  by 110 per cent (impossible, as the maximum percentage of anything is 100) we'll be in exactly the same place we are now -  because 110 per cent of nothing is still nothing . 
 *According to a commentator on Sue Marsh's excellent  Diary of a Benefit Scrounger  blog, ATOS means "Authorised To Organise Slaughter".

 Workfare ruling leaves too many questions unanswered

 Cait Reilly, the graduate who was forced to leave her voluntary work in a museum to stack shelves at Poundland on the government's Workfare scheme, has lost her case against the government. 
Mr Justice Foskitt, at the High Court in London, said, "characterising such a scheme as involving or being analogous to 'slavery' or 'forced labour' seems to me to be a long way from contemporary thinking". 
What an interesting choice of words! 
Back at the turn of the century, contemporary thinking stated that a woman's place was in the home, and that she must never contradict her husband, take a job, or be allowed the right to vote. A few decades ago, contemporary thinking about homosexuality forced Alan Turing, the Bletchworth Park genius who cracked the Enigma code, thereby hugely boosting the Allies' chances of winning World War II, to commit suicide. 
Contemporary thinking has been responsible for terrible injustices and this is one of them. 
I wonder if he really meant "contemporary thinking", anyway.  Did he, in fact, mean it 's a long way from what the government of the day thinks? 
The judge ruled that Workfare does not contravene article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits forced labour and slavery. 
A friend of mine looked up "slave" in the dictionary and found among its definitions the following: "A person who is forced to work for another against his will" and "A person who works in harsh conditions for low pay". 
I think we can agree that Cait Reilly was made to work at Poundland against her will (we'll get to the failings of the DWP's correspondence in a moment) and, while I can't comment on the conditions, it is certain that her benefit payment was below minimum wage and therefore, by definition, was low pay. 
So by dictionary definitions, she was a slave.  Perhaps the judge was commenting on the fact that the legal definition needs to be rewritten? 
It wasn't all good news for the government, though. Although this scheme will remain unpaid, it seems it must be totally voluntary, and communications between the DWP and claimants must reflect this. In other words, the DWP must clean up its correspondence to make it clear that claimants can say no. 
Those who have already had their benefits removed for refusing Workfare might now be entitled to compensation. Law firm Public Interest Lawyers, who acted for Ms Reilly, said more than 22,000 people had been stripped of their benefits for refusing Workfare by January 2012. By now (August) this figure may have doubled. 
The DWP has announced that it will appeal against the decision. A spokesman has been quoted by the  Guardian  , saying: "We do not believe there is anything wrong with the original letters and we will appeal this aspect of the judgment, but in the meantime we have revised our standard letters." 
This begs the obvious question:  If there was nothing wrong with the original letters, why change them? 
The saddest fact about the case is that none of the above touches the real problems with Workfare. 
It is not the taxpayers' responsibility to pay the wages of people employed by a private company. If Poundland wants people to stack its shelves, it should hire them at a living wage, rather than ask the government to provide workers and pay them only in state benefits. 
Poundland’s annual profit in 2010 was £21,500,000. Split among its 390-odd stores, that’s more than £54,000 – or enough to pay three extra employees, per store, on minimum wage, with cash to spare. Make it a decent, living wage, and that's still two extra employees (with a lot more cash to spare). 
It could be argued that Poundland has been providing a public service for the government by taking on Workfare jobseekers when it didn't need any more employees. If this is the case,  we must ask why Cait Reilly was promised a job interview  at the end of it. The fact that the promised interview never happened, I think, also provides our answer: Poundland has been taking advantage of the scheme to get cheap labour. 
If that is true, then the company has gained financial benefit from having Ms Reilly - and others on Workfare - stacking its shelves. Poundland has made money from it, so Poundland should pay all those working for the company a decent wage - including those on Workfare who have helped create that profit. 
If this does not happen, then no employer in his or her right mind would think of paying the full amount for an employee when they can get them on Workfare instead, and have the taxpayer foot the bill.  Workfare is therefore a way of ensuring that the current lack of full-time jobs continues into the future. 
 At a time when the government is complaining that the benefits bill is too high  - and trying to blame that on so-called workshy scroungers fraudulently claiming they are disabled (fraud rate on those is less than 0.4 per cent) -  it is insane for ministers to send those on benefits to work for profitable firms at no cost to the employer.
