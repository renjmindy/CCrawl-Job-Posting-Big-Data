 Overview 
 Thank you for your interest in Dropbox careers. We are actively hiring for this position and look forward to reviewing your application. Dropbox is continuing to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic as the health and safety of our community, employees and candidates remain our number one priority. We appreciate your flexibility as we adapt our hiring processes during this evolving situation. 
 Dropbox is the world‚Äôs first smart workspace that helps people and teams focus on the work that matters. With more than 600 million registered users across 180 countries, we‚Äôre on a mission to design a more enlightened way of working. Dropbox is headquartered in San Francisco, CA, and has 12 offices around the world. 
 Team Description 
 Our Business Strategy & Operations team sets and drives key business initiatives across the company. We complement and support product, engineering, sales, and marketing teams across three critical areas: corporate and business unit strategy, business planning and sales operations, and business systems and tools development.

 You are a self-starter and independent thinker with exceptional analytical skills, capable of handling highly sensitive and confidential information while supporting a rapidly changing organization. You do not shy away from rolling up your sleeves, slicing and dicing massive sets of information, and creating solutions to problems that have not been tackled yet. You recognize where processes can be improved, and take the initiative to improve them. 
 But you don‚Äôt just live in the weeds - you‚Äôre comfortable interacting across the organization at all levels, including senior leaders in sales, finance, marketing and people operations. You‚Äôre a great teammate, and relish collaborating with your Sales Strategy and Operations colleagues across the globe. 
 While you thrive in ambiguity, you‚Äôre highly organized, detail-oriented and love structuring out problems to keep everyone on track. 
 Responsibilities 
 
 Conduct in-depth analysis of the Channel Sales business and develop a deep understanding of key value drivers to identify growth opportunities 
 Synthesize key insights into executive-level presentations for key stakeholders (Global Head of Channel Sales, Chief Sales Officers, and Chief Operating Officer); resulting in decisions that accelerate productivity across the field to achieve overall company objectives 
 Develop scorecards that can be leveraged by the executive team to instrument, optimize, and scale the business for accelerated growth 
 Lead high priority global initiatives including annual strategic planning, book of business construction, goal setting, and market segmentation 
 Drive fiscal planning and execution, including recommending organizational structure, financial goal setting, quota setting, and market segmentation 
 
 Requirements 
 
 5 to 8 years of work experience; with background in management consulting, finance, or sales strategy and operations roles strongly preferred 
 Deep interest and skill in quantitative analytics and financial modeling, drawing insight from complex data, and translating that into concrete action - SQL and Tableau experience is a strong plus 
 Demonstrated ability to structure complex problems and drive solutions cross-functionally 
 Experience communicating with senior management 
 ‚ÄúBuilding‚Äù mentality - a strong desire to take the initiative; you thrive on change and are comfortable with ambiguity 
 Interest in potentially growing into a leadership role is a plus 
 Bachelors degree required 
 
 Benefits and Perks 
 
 100% company paid individual medical, dental, & vision insurance coverage 
 401k + company match 
 Market competitive total compensation package 
 Free Dropbox space for your friends and family 
 Wellness Reimbursement 
 Generous vacation policy 
 10 company paid holidays 
 Volunteer time off 
 Company sponsored tech talks (technology and other relevant professional topics) 
 
 Dropbox is an equal opportunity employer. We are a welcoming place for everyone, and we do our best to make sure all people feel supported and connected at work. A big part of that effort is our support for members and allies of internal groups like Asians at Dropbox, BlackDropboxers, Latinx, Pridebox (LGBTQ), Vets at Dropbox, Women at Dropbox, ATX Diversity (based in Austin, Texas) and the Dropbox Empowerment Network (based in Dublin, Ireland).
