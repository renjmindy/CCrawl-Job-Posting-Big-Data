 Jason Bobst Takes Over As West Norriton’s Manager 
 _**Editor 's note: We wish Jason well in his new venture! Thank you **__ for all you did for Pottstown ! _ 
 WEST NORRITON TOWNSHIP, PA  — Jason Bobst started his new job as township manager on Monday with meetings with acting Township Manager Joe Hein, township employees and township businessmen. 
 The 30-year-old  Cumru ,  Berks County , resident had given Pottstown borough officials the required 90-day notice but Pottstown appointed Pottstown Police Chief Mark Flanders as interim manager and let Bobst leave two weeks early to take on his new position. 
 “The biggest thing is to sit down with the staff,” Bobst said during a Monday morning interview. “The next two days will be to get to know them and getting to work.” 
 The West Norriton Board of Commissioners approved a two-year employment contract for the $100,000-per-year job along with a car lease for a Ford Explorer. The contract specifies a performance/salary review after the first year.

 Editor 's note:  Pottstown 's loss is  West Norriton 's gain. And it is Pottstown's loss! Good luck finding somebody to replace Jason! We wish Jason the best of luck in his new position and thank him for leaving Pottstown in better shape than he found it. 
 POTTSTOWN, Pa.  — Borough Manager Jason Bobst is leaving the post he has held for three years to take a job as the township manager of West Norriton. 
 With the 90 days’ notice his contract requires, his last day will fall sometime in August. 
 Bobst said Tuesday he had not been looking for long, “but I saw an opportunity that opened up and it piqued my interest.” 
 He was helped in what he said was “a difficult decision” by “ongoing issues around here,” but he declined to elaborate.
