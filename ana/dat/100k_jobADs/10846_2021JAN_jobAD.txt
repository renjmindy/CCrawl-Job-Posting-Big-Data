  12 Best Tips For Entry-Level Job Seekers  
 Katherine Switzer 
 January 16, 2014 
 As a fresh graduate, it is always intimidating looking for your first job. At this point, you are more interested in getting into the corporate world rather getting on to the dream job. Have you ever thought what leads you to that “dream job”? Precision, careful attitude, and positivity is the key to the hot seat job. Here are a few tips for entry-level job seekers: 
 1. Get Noticed With Your Cover Letter 
 For a job opening, it's common for the HR manager to get a thousand applications. What's so great about you? Why should you get an interview? Give it your best shot by providing a precise, interesting, and effective cover letter. The right cover letter encourages the recruiter to go through your resume. ( Check out these tips for writing a great cover letter! ) 
 2. Refrain From Long Stories 
 First off, the cover letter must not be more than 200 words. Similarly, the resume should only be strategic highlights of your professional career. 
 3. Don't Get Overly Formal 
 Be simple yet effective. Do not use bold phrases, clichés, or idioms create an impression. 
 4. Have Faith In Yourself 
 Nothing can beat you if you have self-confidence. There is no place for “GOOD” in the corporate world. Competition is ferocious and companies want someone who believes in him or herself. 
 5. Know About The Organization 
 If you were called for an interview at L’Oreal, never say “So, you people manufacture and sell cosmetics?" Make sure you know each bit of the organization you are going for - the latest happenings, the past issues, the website, and the articles. You should aim to know at least 80% of what an already hired employee knows. 
 6. Sell Yourself Logically 
 One of the most important questions is, “How beneficial can you be for the organization?” Never talk about what you can do. Talk in terms of what you CAN do to make the organization better. If you have sales experience, you can say something like, “With my knowledge and experience in sales, I can make sure I sell at least XYZ amount of products each month by working on XYZ aspects.” This makes more sense and shows your ability. 
 7. Act Mature 
 Talk in terms of how your abilities can help in the betterment of the organization. No one wants to know what you learned from your childhood. 
 8. Relate Your Abilities To The Job 
 Focus on talking about those trainings, subjects, and specializations that have something to do with your job. 
 9. Never Boast About Your GPA 
 You might be a brilliant student, but if you fail to impress the interviewer, your GPA will not save you. Talk about your experience and how you can benefit the organization. 
 10. Don't Exaggerate 
 Don't lie or exaggerate. Even a single lie can outshine your abilities and competencies. 
 11. Prepare, Prepare, And Prepare 
 Always walk in an interview with good preparation. This includes everything from your appearance to knowledge about the organization. If you get a chance, get information about the interviewer, too. 
 12. Leave Like A Gentleman (Or Lady) 
 Always leave by paying good regards to the interviewer and show your interest towards working in the organization.  Enjoy this article? You've got time for another! Check out these related articles:
