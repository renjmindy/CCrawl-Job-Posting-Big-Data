 It's been over six months since Hurricane Sandy, and we're still working hard to help our communities rebuild. To that purpose, we're teaming up with 20 non-profit organizations to host a  Post Sandy Job Fair  to help people find work after the destruction-packed hurricane. 
 
 Join us at Resorts World, 110-00 Rockaway Blvd. in Jamaica, Queens on 5/14 for immediate employment opportunities. We're rebuilding communities one job at a time! 
 The  “Post Sandy Job Fair”  will be held on  Tuesday, May 14  , from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at Resorts World, 110-00 Rockaway Blvd., Jamaica NY 11420. Employers are encouraged to contact the job fair organizers through the organization’s web site at:  http://www.postsandyjobfair.org/ . 
 Anyone interested in finding a job is welcome, and attendance is free.  The organizing committee expects as many as 250-300 companies from a wide range of sectors to participate, each one having committed to hire at least one candidate. Employers will determine the number of actual jobs that are available. The day of the event, experts will provide workshops and assistance with interviewing skills and resume preparation. 
 The idea is to create  immediate employment opportunities  by exposing qualified job seekers to employers with the intent to hire, and to stimulate the employment climate in Greater New York and create accelerated momentum in a recovering economy. 
 So, let’s all try and put the effects of Hurricane Sandy far behind us by supporting this worthy effort to help people in our area find work. We hope you'll join us May 14th at at Resorts World, 110-00 Rockaway Blvd., Jamaica NY 11420.  We 're rebuilding lives, one job at a time.
