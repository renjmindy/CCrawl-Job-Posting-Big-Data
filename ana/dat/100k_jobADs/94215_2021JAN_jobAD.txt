 Career Talk with Holly Bunn: You've been laid off, now what? (Show Notes) 
 May 30, 2015 Holly Bunn 
 Thank you for listening to my Blogtalk radio show on what to do once you've been laid off. If you missed the show, listen to the recording here:  Career Talk with Holly Bunn: You 've been laid off, now what? (EP07) 
 During the show I revealed my best tips for survival once you've been laid off or find yourself unemployed. Below are show notes for your reference. 
 What To Do As Soon As You Are Laid Off 
 DAY 1 
 
 Don 't panic.  Pray - be grateful for what you have and be thankful for what's coming. 
 Prepare the family  - be honest and tell them what's going on because life will change a bit, even if temporarily. This will be a hard transition, if you panic. The family will panic if you panic. If you are calm, they are calm. 
 Evaluate your finances:  your lifestyle may change a little as a result of being laid off or unemployed. Decide what you will temporarily give up, adjust, or change until you land a new job. Reminder, the job search can take 2-3 months. 
 
 DAY 2 
 
 File for unemployment  - Google unemployment for your state and follow instructions on how to file.  File for SNAP Food stamp benefits  - please do not be too proud to ask for these benefits. In some cases, you are eligible for emergency cash and food benefits for a couple of weeks until your unemployment starts. 
 Formulat e a job search plan - target the job you want.  A focused job search plan creates optimism, hope, and direction - a purpose. Decide if you want the same job you had or is this an opportunity for a promotion, new career, or time to start your own business. Listen to  Episode 5  of my show archives on creating a job search plan. 
 
 DAYS 3 - 5 
 
 Prepare your tools:   Resume  ,  Social Media profiles starting with LinkedIn . Invest this time. It will pay off in the end. For more information on preparing your resume, listen to  Episode 6   of my show. 
 Prepare your workspace:  (listen to  Episode 5  for more detail) 
 
 WEEKS 2 - 3 
 
 
 Apply for jobs only after you are prepared (Days 1 - 5) 
 Register with temporary agencies and/or headhunters. 
 Become a consultant or start your own business. 
 
 **What NOT To Do As Soon As You Are Laid Off ** 
 
 Do not look for a job on Day 1.  The key to a successful job search is preparation. You will be frustrated and your job search prolonged if you don't have a plan or the tools in place. 
 Do not go on vacation,  **  make large purchases, or go on a shopping spree with your severance. ** 
 Do not post, tweet, email, or otherwise broadcast that you are unemployed and looking for opportunities.  You will appear desperate. **** Instead, post interesting information that shows you are an expert in your field; keyword optimize your social profile for the job you are targeting. 
 
 Social Media Tips 
 
 Remove or hide anything that would be a challenge for you being a credible candidate. 
 Remove/hide pictures and videos of alcohol, violence, nudity, or other risque photos and videos. 
 Do not use profanity in status updates or references to drugs. 
 Omit spelling and grammar errors on status updates. ( Grammarly   is free and checks grammar/punctuation of all posts automatically)
