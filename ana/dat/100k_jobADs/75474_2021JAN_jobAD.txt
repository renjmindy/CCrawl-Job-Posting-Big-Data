  The Ugly Truth About Getting Your Dream Job  
 Ryan Niessen 
 April 04, 2014 
 What if you discovered that everything you’ve been taught about creating success in your life was wrong? What if the system society has in place to help you create a great life and get a job you love… didn’t work any more? Well, that’s exactly what this viral video parody of an ‘ honest university commercial ’ is telling you, loud and clear.  Related:   How To Get Through ‘The Cave’ To Your Dream Job  See, most of us were raised with the belief that the clear path to success, happiness, and our dream job is to go to school and get a degree. However, as this video does such a good (and hilarious) job of explaining, more people are realizing every day that this old model is broken. Now, I share at the bottom of this article how to actually get your dream job. But the bottom line is that the high costs of tuition, books, and living you endure during your 4+ years of college no longer guarantee you a great job - and with more smart, ambitious, and qualified people graduating every year - the competition for your dream job is fierce. 
 
 3 Rules For Getting Your Dream Job 
 So, here’s how to win... 
 Rule #1 - Don’t Rely Solely On Your Formal Education 
 For many people in many fields, a college degree is a necessity for getting a job. However, accept the fact that if you want to stand out and get your dream job, then your degree is NOT going to give you everything you need to succeed in life. And if your chosen field requires a university degree, then make the most of it. Just recognize that your real key to success lies in seeking education outside of the university walls. Personally, I’ve gone through thousands of dollars worth of education outside of college to develop myself both personally and professionally. And I can honestly say that my return on investment has likely been 10x that of my formal education. One day, these big education system challenges will be solved. But right now, we all have to do the best we can with what we have. So, find the leaders in your field, and learn from their books, courses, and conferences. That’s how you’ll get ahead. 
 Rule #2 - Be A Winner, Not A Whiner 
 Is the job market tough? Yes. Is the education system less than perfect and more expensive than ever? Yes. Is it going to take a lot of effort, time, and money to achieve your dreams? Yes. In many ways, this is an incredibly challenging time for young people to make it in the world. Yet, the silver lining is that it may also be the most opportunity-filled and rewarding time. The Internet has made getting educated and working easier and more flexible than ever. If you want to have fun at work, travel, and make a difference in the world, then you don’t have to be tied down to a traditional 9-5 job. There are more successful companies popping up all the time, like those on the new GameChangers500 list, who are making a profit as well as a difference in the world, who offer unique opportunities for their employees, and who are environmentally conscious. You can live a life of adventure and freedom, while working for a company you love, on a mission you care about. You just have to put the effort into doing so, and choose to win, rather than whine. 
 Rule #3 - Model The Best 
 I have a newsflash for you: you’re not the first person trying to get your dream job. Plenty have come before you, and plenty more will come after you. And those who succeed will be the ones who studied successful people, and modeled what they did. When I was looking for my  dream job , I used the strategies of someone who’s now my good friend, Andrew Hewitt (he’s also the founder of the GameChangers 500 list I mentioned earlier). Thanks to him, I was able to get my foot in the door of an industry I’d been trying to get into for years. So, who woke up today with the life you want to have? Find a way to contact them, and ask them how they did it. You’ll get some fantastic insight on where to start, and potentially even a lead on someone to contact for a job or internship. Remember, don’t rely solely on your formal education, choose to be a winner, and model the best, and you’ll get your dream job. And if you want a little more help, here’s a  free video  I put together with Andrew (the founder of the GameChangers 500) with more tips you can apply today to get your dream job with a GameChanging company.
