 Per CBO, Obama's plan to raise Minimum Wage will DESTROY 500,000 jobs 
 Posted on  February 18, 2014  by  justturnright  |  12 comments 
 
 Congratulations, folks! At least half-a-million of you soon won't be "  **  stuck in a job ** " anymore… 
 Yay, you!! 
 (  via   Reuters  ) - "…Raising the U.S. federal minimum wage to $10.10, as President Barack Obama and Democrats in Congress are proposing, could  result in about 500,000 jobs being lost by late 2016  , the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated on Tuesday…"

 #Obamacare, the Media, and Lying about Lying 
 Posted on  February 6, 2014  by  justturnright  |  10 comments 
 
 You may have heard that the CBO (Congressional Budget Office) recently released a disastrous report which detailed that Obamacare was  likely to result in 2.3 million fewer jobs . 
 But as fast as that news came out, the Democrats and their Media shills issued a counter narrative: " **  No, that 's not true!  **It's not that Obamacare will kill jobs! It's only that people will choose not to work (  or work as much  ) so as to qualify for health care subsidies, and THAT means that there'll be the equivalent of 2.3 million _ fewer  _people working. 
 See? It just kills employment, not jobs, which is  TOTALLY  different! Sorta…" 
 Of course, the casual news gatherer (  which is way more than half the population  ) never heard the second half of that argument. They heard  " No, that's not true…" , and the rest faded into Miss Othmar's voice from the Charlie Brown cartoons. No matter, they got the gist: those Republicans have obviously lied once again about King Barack the Beneficent and his glorious Health Care Machine. The details as to exactly if, how or why they lied are probably unimportant, anyway. 
 Except that they're not.

 Did you hear the great news? 
 
 CBO:  #Obamacare  will kill at least 2.3 million jobs  http://t.co/thYmXBofW2

 (  via  the Associated Press ) - "…Several million people will reduce their hours on the job or leave the workforce  entirely because of incentives  built into President Barack Obama’s health care overhaul, the Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday. 
 That would mean job losses equal to 2.3 million full-time jobs by 2021, in large part  because people would opt to keep their income low to stay eligible for federal health care subsidies or Medicaid  , the agency said. It had estimated previously that the law would lead to 800,000 fewer jobs by that year…" 
 Sure, sure, that doesn't seem like great news. But that's exactly why the White House's crack PR spin-meisters (  CODENAME: the "  A  lternate  R  eality  T  eam" ) was activated as soon as this news hit. The guys from the A.R.T. (  motto: "Anyone can lie, but what we do is ART" ) instantly assured everyone within earshot that  y'all are just too stupid to understand  complex economy-related terms, such as "  fewer jobs  " and "  2.3 million of 'em ":

 Latest Obama Press Conference: "#Unemployment Benefits CREATE Jobs"!! 
 Posted on  January 7, 2014  by  justturnright  |  4 comments 
 
 Just as he has for the past 5 years, President "YouCanKeepYourPlan" Obama believes that no matter what he says, as long as he says it over and over and over again, it'll somehow magically come to pass. Or at the very least, that we'll believe him  just  long enough for him to get his way. 
 That was an interesting if misguided theory at the advent of his tenure. But now, with the country trillions further in debt and no end in sight, it's now more accurately to be considered either "dangerous" or "delusional". 
 Honestly,  I think it's a toss-up :

 Hey, what happened to Obama's "laser-like focus" on jobs? 
 Posted on  September 12, 2013  by  justturnright  |  14 comments 
 Lost in all of the Syria/Obama/will-he-or-won't-he headlines from the past several days is the massive devastation of the United States jobs market. 
 Glenn Foden over at Townhall.com  summarized it perfectly: 
 
 -- 
 To place Glenn's cartoon into context, all you need is this article  from Bloomberg News : 
 "…While  unemployment  dropped last month to  7.3 percent , the lowest level since December 2008,  the decline occurred because of contraction in the workforce,  not  because more people got jobs. Labor-force participation  -- the share of working-age people either holding a job or looking for one -- **  stands at a 35-year low **."

 Tired of poor Customer Service? Blame our Culture of Dependency 
 Posted on  August 15, 2013  by  justturnright  |  11 comments 
 Excellent Customer Service is one of the  clichéd  catch phrases that every company SAYS is important to them, but too few seem to really emulate. 
 It's evidenced by the automated phone messages that repeatedly assure us that "our call  is  important to them", and then make us jump through an endless labyrinth of prompts and codes. We see it with the grocery store cashier who doesn't even make eye contact with us as he or she drones "…  have a nice day  …" in  a Ben Stein-ian monotone . 
 It's not like this is rocket science, gang: a sincere smile, a pleasant "how may I assist you?", and then actively  helping  us is really all we want. 
 We just don't _ get  _it very often.

 Chutzpah: Obama now says there's 'No Evidence' #KeystoneXL Would Create Many Jobs 
 Posted on  July 30, 2013  by  justturnright  |  11 comments 
 This news item got a bit lost over the weekend, which may have been by intent. However, this excerpt shows you just how deeply indebted (  or how like-minded  ) President Obama is to the radical "Green" lobby in the United States. 
 From Breitbart.com : 
 In a  New York Times  interview  published  Saturday,  President Obama  came out foursquare  against  the  Keystone XL pipeline  , claiming that it would not create jobs. “Republicans have said that this would be a big jobs generator,” Obama said. “There is no evidence that that’s true.”
