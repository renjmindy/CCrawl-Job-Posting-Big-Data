 Josephine is my name and i'm from Ghana. I have a passion for books that's why i have created this blog and my favourite genres are: legal thriller, crime, action, thriller, murder, detective, mystery, political espionage, paranormal, medical thriller, fiction and suspense. I am one of the curious type. I like to see how authors use words and their imaginative world. There's is nothing like a good book. Books keeps me focused and it calms my thoughts.Books transport me to a different world where the impossible becomes possible.Sometimes the journey and the perseverance of the characters in the books that i read, gives me insight to a parallel in my own life. I give much respect to the wonderful authors of the books i recommend and blog about. I personally describe good books or novels as a perfect imaginative world.
