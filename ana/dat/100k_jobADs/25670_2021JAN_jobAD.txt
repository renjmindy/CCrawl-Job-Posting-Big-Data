 Management Accountant - Birmingham Business Park - £40 - 45k + Bonus. 
 If you a enjoy a mundane, repetitive and steady management accounting position. This one wont be for you. 
 I am working with a PE backed organisation who are growing rapidly through acquisitions and organic growth, with aggressive expansion plans and a need for a confident Management Accountant to join the team and support the Financial Controller. 
 This is a great opportunity for a Qualified Accountant who wants to "get behind" the numbers and make a real impact. The role will have a focus on preparing the management accounts. The month end process is 8 days with an aim of reducing that and ensuring that the team can spend more time with non-finance improving performance. 
 The business is highly acquisitive with a number of companies currently being integrated with a view that there will be 2/3 more by this time next year. The role will therefor be offering exposure of buying new businesses, due diligence and integration, and provide a platform for an ambitious Accountant to progress into a senior role within a PE backed company in the future. 
 The FC is looking for someone that will be hungry to add wants to be a Finance Manager or Financial Controller in the future and is willing to offer all the supported needed to ensure that happens. 
 Process improvement will be essential and previous experience of doing so will be an advantage, however, the right personality will be confident, hungry to learn and hands on mentality.
