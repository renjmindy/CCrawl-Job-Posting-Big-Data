 Queens On The Job Injury Lawyer 
 A  Queens On The Job Injury Lawyer  from Polsky, Shouldice & Rosen, P.C. is used to answering questions people have about recent work injury accidents. If you or a loved one was injured or became ill at work, you may need legal guidance to better understand your options and how to handle the situation with your best interests in mind. If your employer has a workers comp program, then you may receive coverage for medical care, loss of wage, and more. 
 We provide free initial consultations for new clients who are interested in getting advdice from a legal professional. While your friends, family, and coworkers may give you advice for your workers comp claim, it is important that you get insight that is personal for your unique circumstances. 
 It is required that I have a workers compensation lawyer help me? 
 If you missed a couple days of work and your injury wasn’t severe, then you may not need help from a lawyer. However, even in what may appear to be a simple case, there are times when things can go wrong. For example, your employer may mishandle your claim intentionally so you don’t receive benefits. Or, you may be wrongfully denied coverage when you are rightfully due benefits. You may even have been approved for workers benefits, but aren’t getting enough to cover your expenses. 
 What if the accident was my fault?  ** _ 
_** Unless you had engaged in risky behavior, were under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or started a fight at work, then determining who was at-fault is not so much of a concern. In fact, worker comp programs were established to protect both employee and employer in the event of a workplace injury accident. The priority of your Queens, NY On The Job Injury Lawyer will be to oversee the process of your workers comp claim and ensure that your case is being treated fairly. 
 What types of benefits can I get from workers comp? 
 At the very least, your employer’s workers compensation program should cover medical bills that are reasonable based on the severity of the injury. There are paymentn limits for specific kinds of treatment, such as physical therapy and chiropractic care. If you miss more than a few days at work, you may also be entitled to get temporary disability benefits to fill the gap in your lost income. 
 If your injury is going to last long-term or permanently, you may be eligible for permanent disability benefits. Other benefits you may be qualified for include coverage for retraining and classes. If a family member passed away at work, then the surviving family may be awarded death benefits under workers compensation. 
 What if a claim adjuster calls me? 
 Claim adjusters handle workers comp claims, and may contect you to verify the details of your injury and the accident. You must be wary of what you say to this representative, as your words may be misconstrued and taken for your injury or condition not actually being as serious as you claim. This person is not your friend, no matter how friendly they may be, so we suggest letting us take over the call instead.
