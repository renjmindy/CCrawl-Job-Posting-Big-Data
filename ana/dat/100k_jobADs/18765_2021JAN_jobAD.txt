  CONTEST for Job Seekers: Sell Your Company-of-One (a.k.a. YOU) in 140 Characters or Less!  
 Work It Daily 
 May 06, 2009 
 By J.T. O'Donnell I'm throwing down a challenge for job seekers everywhere. (Well, for the ones that use Twitter that is.) Let's see who can do the best job of selling themselves using micro-blogging. For the next 24 hours, I'm asking folks to send  @CAREEREALISM  a tweet with a sales pitch. What are you selling? YOU, of course. Then, we'll retweet it so all our readers can see it too!  Why Bother? It's A Great Way to See How Good You Are at Personal Branding On-line!  Think of it as a 140-character resume or cover letter. What can you say to draw attention to yourself and get our followers to click on your Twitter profile? Better still, what will we see when we click on it? Is your profile ready for prime-time? Does your brand on Twitter make you a credible professional in your field? In short, make sure your tweet matches what we see in your profile. Why? Because that is the right way to brand yourself on Twitter.  Consistency  is key in a good personal brand.  Who Will Choose the Winner? Better Still, What's at Stake?  The CAREEREALISM staff and I are going to choose the top tweets and then we'll have a vote to see who did the best job. The winner gets bragging rights and  FREE admission into CAREEREALISM University . So, bring it on and show the Twittersphere what you got. Sell us on your professional strengths and get us to click on your brand with your compelling tweet. May the best tweeting job seeker win!
