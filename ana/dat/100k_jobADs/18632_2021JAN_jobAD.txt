  2 Career Problems That Start With Your TV  
 Christie Mims 
 March 11, 2016 
 Do you love TV? Me too. Full disclosure: I have a Downton Abbey obsession that is responsible for many lost hours. Viva the Dowager! I've also shamelessly binge-watched Game of Thrones, House of Cards, Friends, and - in very low moments, The Real Housewives of New Jersey. Yes...you can judge me. :)  Related: 2 Odd Job Search Problems That Happen In January  So, I understand how easy it is to sit on the couch, turn on the TV, and end up there for far longer than you had planned. It happens to all of us. But...maybe it's time to draw the line. As a career coach, I talk to many people about their struggles with work, and a few things come up again and again. The surprising thing: Some of the problems they experience (and you might too), start with that little box under your TV. 
 
 #1: The Cost of Cable Vs. Your Career 
 So here's my first question: What are you paying for your cable bill per month? $75? $120? Here's my second question: Aside from investing in college or graduate school, when was the last time you  truly invested  in your career? When was the last time you took a training course, joined an interesting association, attended a cool or inspirational conference, or gotten some coaching or leadership training? For many of us, the answer is….“hmmmm" or “not that recently" or “I can't remember." Most of us attend company-required trainings, but not much else. But that's a mistake. In the future we are headed to a time when companies hire more freelance and agile workers, and our work-days (and how we work) will look a lot different. It's time to invest in yourself and your career now, so that you are one of the agile, flexible, and skilled employees that are sought-after. Not someone who has fallen into a rut and fallen behind. So let's bring it back to your cable bill: Imagine if you spent that $100 per month on your career. That money adds up to over $1000 dollars per year! Without saving or changing much of anything, you've just freed up a good chunk of change to invest in a program, conference, or certification. Not bad, right? 
 #2: Cable Time Vs. Career Investment 
 Cable TV is such a tremendous timesuck. I am the first to admit that I was a repeat offender: When I was an unhappy consultant, hours were spent on my couch watching the Real Housewives or something to do with cupcakes (I loooove cupcakes). But, I lost so much time in my life!! I watched cable because I was unhappy at work, and it was easy to just sit and check-out. You get up on a Saturday morning all gung-ho about doing something proactive, turn on the TV “just for a second" and wind up in a cable-coma that lasts for hours. You wake up at 4 pm wondering where the day went, and somehow nothing seems to get done. Sound familiar? Imagine if instead of spending hours on TV, you spend  just a few  of those hours on your career. You could read inspiring or informative books. Grab a coffee with a new connection, or just stalk people and connect with them on LinkedIn (and then perhaps learn more about what they do). TV isn't really that important -  but work you love  is. And if you really want an eye-opening experience, keep a journal for a week and see how much time you spend actually in front of the TV. When I did it - ohhhh, the shame! So, you aren't alone. But it doesn't have to hold you back anymore. Here's what I want you to remember: You are likely to spend more than 3,000 hours a year at work, commuting to work, and thinking about work. During your working lifetime, you will probably spend  more  hours at work than with your spouse or asleep. That's a LOT of time to be unhappy, bored, drained, or just stuck in a rut. Don't you and your career deserve better? If you want something better for your career - especially to be happier at work, then grab my fancy-pants free workbook on the 6 Simple Steps To Finding Work That Makes You Happy (it's more fun than HGTV reruns and definitely beats hating your job!)
