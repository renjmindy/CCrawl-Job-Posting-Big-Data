 Have You Been Doing the Same Kind of Job the Past Seven Years?

 Heart to Heart __

 If you have been doing the same work for the past seven years - I mean, doing the same kind of activities in your job, receiving the same kind of rewards, going through the same level of life experiences - I am afraid you may be unwittingly living on the mediocre plane. Seven years is plenty enough for any ambitious person to start moving out of his or her present borders of accomplishment to new frontiers in their dreams. But I suppose a large percentage of people in any human endeavor are quite content working the same way they have been doing since the past many years, as long as their job is continuing to remunerate them with what they have been happily receiving from it all along. 
 But for a small percentage of people, mediocrity is the biggest thief of their human potential. These are the people who are always moving on, the ones who are always expanding their present borders and exploring uncharted territories. These are the relentless innovators who are always trying out new methods and untried strategies in their work. And such people do  not  remain long on any pinnacle of success they have attained. 
 
 “One of the temptations in life to be guarded against is that of sinking into a spirit of complacence, to slack off. As we climb the hill of life, it is natural to rest a moment on reaching the summit of a ridge. The temptation is to stay there, satisfied with your efforts.” Lord Chatfield 
 
 In the sunset of your life, when you look back at all that you have achieved, your greatest sense of fulfillment comes from the bold and extraordinary initiatives you took in your job, in your personal life, and above all, in your relationships. You refused to be an ordinary bleating sheep in a familiar herd grazing contentedly within the fences erected by others, or even by yourself. Your spirit soared to new limitless pastures that your inner eyes had espied beckoning you from a distant shore. 
 
 ‘The difference between a successful person and a very successful person is the size of his or her dreams.’ Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad. 
 
 If you resolutely decide that from today you will begin to break out of your ordinarily successful life and search for unexplored new frontiers in your professional and personal goals, then on this very day you have flapped your wings of aspiration and begun your ascend to the azure skies of your grand vision. And if you dont take your eyes of that distant shore, you are surely going to reach it sooner or later. 
 Perhaps, if you are a business executive, or a professional, you can start by trying to implement something extraordinary in your company - something that no colleague of yours was innovative and daring enough to try so far. If you are a decisionmaker, perhaps you can stretch your vision still further to include some seemingly ludicrous projects - until the world gasps at the fruition of what they once thought was merely your eccentric dream. 
 
 ‘We must overcome the notion that we must be regular. It robs you of the chance to be extraordinary and leads you to the mediocre.’ Uta Hagen 
 
 By the way, for the sake of some odd men whose wings are clipped not because of a dearth of imagination but because of another reason - a marital one - I give below an insight from a renowned achiever of the fairer gender. I came across this quote soon after I finished writing the preceding paragraph. It will give all our male readers a new perspective on mediocrity: 
 
 ‘Women want mediocre men, and men are working hard to become as mediocre as possible.’ Margaret Mead, US anthropologist & popularizer of anthropology (1901 - 1978)
