 I'm currently working with one of the leading vehicle adaptations businesses, who are based here in the Midlands! Specialising in converting a vehicle for either drive from wheelchair or passenger up front controls plus full adaptations for passengers on board. 
 The vehicles they provide are amongst the most technically advanced in the marketplace giving back someone independent living. The role of Adaptations Engineer will consist of reverse engineering a car or van from cradle to grave. This can include electrical, mechanical and interior trim with every job being different depending on specification. 
 You will work closely with production and after sales teams to overcome any difficult practical issues offering your technical knowledge upfront in order to deliver the best results. Given the nature of the work and being very specialist my client understands a level of training will be needed. The ideal candidate will be able to demonstrate 2 of the 3 core skills (Electrical, Mechanical & Interior Trim). 
 In return my clients offers a competitive hourly rate £12 - £13 with full training provided. The business is continuously developing which means future progression would certainly be on the cards. If this sounds like a position of interest please don't hesitate to apply! 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
