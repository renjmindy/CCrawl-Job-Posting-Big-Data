  4 Ways To Build Confidence For A Job Interview  
 Jessica Holbrook Hernandez

 May 27, 2020 
 The interview is one component of the job search process that most people love to hate. While it serves as a sign from the employer that you are being strongly considered for a position, it also can be a source of angst for candidates who fear they'll make mistakes that will cut them out of the running. 
 
 A great way to overcome the anxiety interviews produce is to begin feeling good about the process. Need help getting there? Here are five ways to build confidence for a job interview. 
 Conduct Research 
 One great way to build your interviewing confidence is by conducting plenty of research on the company you're applying with and the position it's offering. A common question interviewers ask is, "Do you know anything about our company?" Most times, candidates are forced to answer, "No." 
 If you're able to share the company's background information and showcase knowledge of its future goals for the position in question, you'll undoubtedly catch the interviewer off-guard, in a great way! 
 Locate Sample Interview Questions 
 There are many sample interview questions floating around the internet that can help you gauge the types of questions you could be asked. Work It Daily has a comprehensive list of the  18 Most Common Interview Questions. 
 Take time to review those questions—and come up with great answers—to ensure the actual interview flows fluidly. 
 Practice Often 
 A great way to build your confidence for the interview is to practice before the big day. You can do this by answering questions in front of the mirror to read your own facial expressions and body language, or have a friend help you with a  mock interview. 
 It's also great to find a professional outfit you feel comfortable wearing. Feeling good in your clothes and knowing you've fully prepared can work wonders in boosting your confidence before the big day. 
 Make Sure You Have No Skeletons

 An important step in preparing for your interview is being able to recall your own career history and discuss prospective goals with the company and in your professional life as a whole. But as you look back over your career, be sure to research yourself online to ensure there are no skeletons on the internet that could be brought up in your interview. 
 Remember, companies conduct background checks often via search engines, so it's up to you to ensure your  social networking profiles are professional , or private.
