 Craigslist does not allow the inclusion of links from applicant tracking systems in job ads on their site. However, they do allow you to link to a careers page on your own web site (e.g. 'companyname.com/careers'). Workable provides multiple options for building a careers page to link to, whether itâ€™s hosted on Workable or externally. 
 Alternatively, if you accept resumes from Craigslist via email you can forward those resumes to the  job mailbox  or  manually upload  them to Workable.
