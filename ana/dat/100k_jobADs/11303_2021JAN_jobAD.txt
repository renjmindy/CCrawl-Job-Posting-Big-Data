 The resources sector has created almost one in three of Queensland's new jobs since the last State election in 2017, according to figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. 
 Queensland Resources Council Chief Executive Ian Macfarlane said the resources industry had created 11 588 jobs, an increase of 21%, since the November 2017 quarter - the time of the last State election - to the end of February this year. 
 "That's the equivalent of a new job in the Queensland resources sector every 57 min. Last year, the industry created a new job every hour in Queensland. We are doing even better," he said. 
 "Across the Queensland economy, 40 000 jobs were created over the same 15 month period. Currently, there are more than 1300 vacancies advertised in resources, mining and energy across Queensland with more vacancies on the horizon. 
 "This week, Sojitz finalised its purchase of the mothballed BHP Mitsubishi Gregory Crinum coal mine northeast of Emerald, with plans to restart production in the first half of this year. 
 "It's great to see an increasing number of women and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders joining the 316 000 Queenslanders directly or indirectly employed by the resources industry. 
 "The Queensland resources industry is delivering for Queensland - more jobs, more investment, more exports and more royalties for Queensland. 
 "The resource sector is helping Queensland post record results for exports and royalties. 
 "Our 81% of the State's merchandise trade is driving exports to more than AUS$80 billion over the last 12 months, and we will return more than AUS$5.2 billion in royalty taxes to the Palaszczuk Government to reinvest in services and infrastructure for all Queenslanders."
