 Looking for a job where you can fully choose your own working hours, be your own boss, and get paid $24-$28 per hour on average? 
 Look no further. LocalStudent is the new way for students to find work. 
 We are now hiring Snow Shovellers for the Fall. LocalStudent was created by students, for students. We know that typical student jobs suck (working in fast food or retail) so we created a job that allows you to stay active while being outdoors and the ability to social distance. Plus, you have full flexibility with your schedule. 
 How it works: We are like Uber for snow shovelling. We have hundreds of customers all across the Greater Toronto Area who need their snow shovelled. You go on our website, simply choose which customers you want to service and when. It's that simple. 
 We pay a flat rate per job. An average driveway usually pays between $25-$35, and can be done in around 45 minutes on average, depending on the size of the driveway and the heaviness of the snowfall. 
 Spots on our team are very limited. To apply, visit www.localstudent.ca/apply
