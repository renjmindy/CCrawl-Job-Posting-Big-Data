 Career 
 
 FALL INTO SOMETHING GOOD 
 Does your career leave you feeling like you fell into a vat of poo? 
 Is every day like swimming with concrete floaties? 
 Do you dread the day to tasks of being where you are? 
 You are not alone. 
 I was you once upon a time. 
 I blamed the dissatisfaction I felt in so many areas on the dissatisfaction I felt at work. I knew if I could find happiness at work, I'd be happier overall. 
 Research proves this: when you have a higher sense of career well being you feel a higher overall sense of well being. 
 Cool. How do you get it? 
 1. You fall into something good. 
 Instead of constantly bitching about how shitty your circumstance is, find the good. There is some small sense of goodness there. Maybe it is simply that the paycheck meets yours needs. That is good. Find the good to fall into every day and you will attract more good. 
 2. You act with good intention 
 You take action that are good for you. You eat right, you declutter, you drink water, you surround yourself with good high vibe people. You take action that you know is positive energy for you. 
 3. You get creative. 
 You look for the things you can shape to your style and you do it. The activities, events and processes that are tailorable, you tailor in such a way that you can find positive energy in them. This might mean a mindset shift, or a physical overhaul - or anywhere in between. 
 These three things have infinite numbers of outcomes ranging from finding a higher degree of satisfaction where you are or striking the entrepreneurial path.  Wherever your energy takes you, falling in love with your career and satisfying that sense of "more" you have been craving is important for your overall well-being. 
 What are you going to fall into? 
 I am a certified personal and executive coach ruthlessly focused on helping people live awesome lives. I spent a large chunk of my life pursuing other people’s ideas of success and while those experiences were sublime in some cases, they weren’t the “more” I was seeking and I just never felt full. In 2011, I made the commitment to live life on my terms and everything changed. The life I love today was created and I am here to share and teach you exactly how to do the same for yourself. 
 I am founder of No Limits Life Empowerment Institute as well as a working glass artist, Reiki Master, Partner in Shaman Grocer in Iowa City, and Co-founder of the Midwest Reiki Festival. My favorite time is spent doing anything soccer related with my aspiring world cup soccer player, 10-year-old Alexander. I am also a pretty big fan of gaming (PS4) with my partner Craig while solving the world’s social problems. Learn more at http://www.nolimitslife.guru

 One Step 
 Hello again! Thank you so much for coming back! 
 Last month I shared about a  personal transformation that I am going through , and it got me thinking about transformations that happen to people. Which then got me thinking about how much really happens “to” us and how much we  choose  to happen. Some people call it fate, or destiny, others call it free will, and still others will say it’s all a matter of what you choose to allow in your life. 
 I believe it’s a combination of all of them. So, while we’re not going to talk about the deeper meaning of destiny or fate and the power of the cosmos, I am going to explore the idea of  how much control do we have over the things that happen in our life and how much (or little) are we taking responsibility for it? 
 To give this some context, I’ll give you some various examples of the concepts I mentioned. A car accident or winning the lottery may be considered fate or destiny, choosing one job over another would be free will, and adding a child to your family or a new car would be choices that we make. But could each of those examples fall into another category? The answer is, of course they could! A car accident could occur because someone chose to text and drive, and you won’t win the lottery unless you play. Choosing one job over another may be free will, but what factors do we weigh when making that decision? And adding a child to a family could be an unexpected surprise rather than a choice or buying a new car could be caused by your 30 year old Buick finally kicking the bucket. 
 All this is to say that no matter what choices we make even with the best intentions and after doing hours of research, some greater power can always play a part.  So how do we move forward in such an unsure and unstable environment?   One step at a time. 
 Sounds cliché, huh? But can you really accept that job without filling out an application and interviewing for it first? Not usually. Can you have a baby without some kind of fertilization process first? Nope. The point is, you have to start somewhere. The question is, when, when will you start? And I have the answer… 
 You will start at the exact moment that you stop letting fear control your decisions. 
 You’re may be thinking, “Yea, that’s easy to say, but what about paying my bills, or taking care of my kid’s or spending time with friends.” And my response to that is, at some point all of those become excuses that hold you back because you’re afraid of what  might happen  if you do try to follow your dreams. If you want something bad enough, if you make the choice that it is important enough to you, then that is the moment you will also start developing your plan to achieve that dream. 
 IMPORTANT NOTICE:  I don’t want to misrepresent what I’m sellin’ here. Making the decision to follow your dream isn’t always easy and without pain, sacrifice, tears, and time. But there will also be laughter, feelings of accomplishment with the little victories you achieve, and celebration! One thing you may not always find when pursuing your dreams is support from people, even those closest to you. This is natural because when you are trekking out on a new journey, it can make people uncomfortable because you’re changing and they aren’t sure how that might affect them, or it reminds them of all the dreams they haven’t gone after. Don’t worry, while this may feel painful at the time, know that if you ever need support on your journey,  reach out to me, I am here for you. (apply for a discovery session ) 
 Now back to you getting everything you want in life.  Once you’ve decided the when (the moment you let go of fear and excuses) you’re now in the purgatory of, How? 
 While you may feel the urge to quit your job and go back to school full-time, try to resist that urge unless you know you can financially afford it. Taking this first step forward isn’t about making quick or irresponsible decisions, it’s about giving yourself time (a day, a week, sometimes more) to acknowledge that you have made the choice to follow your dreams, be proud of that choice, and then come up with your first draft (and maybe your only draft) of your action plan. This can be as detailed or as basic as you want.  There are 2 things I want you to remember about your action plan: 
 
 If you choose to go the basic direction, still make sure that you’re  considering all the areas that may be affected as you move forward  (finances, time commitment, relationships, where you live, etc.) Even if you don’t write each area down, take the time to think through them to make sure you’re considering things that may be pitfalls down the road if they are ignored.  If you’d like some help thinking through different areas, contact me and I would be happy to work through them with you ! 
 And second,  be willing to be flexible . Like I mentioned at the beginning, that greater power, whatever you believe, may feel like it’s trying to derail you from achieving your dream. You will most likely go through times that it feels like everything is working against you. Don’t give up. Don’t give in. This is the universe challenging you to see how bad you really want it. This is your opportunity to show your strength and determination, and will be the point just before you  achieve your dream . 
 
 So your homework… 
 
 Write down a list of ALL the dreams you can think of that you have right now and dreams that you used to have but something happened that made you stop even considering that from ever happening. 
 Then, try to prioritize that list at least to get your top 5 dreams you’d like to achieve. 
 
 Once you’ve done that, you’ll be ready for what I have in store for you next month! Come back again! 
 If you’d like to get started on your next steps sooner, sign up for a  Free Discovery Session  **  ! ** 
 Until next month, wishing you many blessings!

 Uncovering 
 No Limits Life Empowerment Career Domain Expert Kari Rossetti 
 As I was thinking about what to write this month, I started to panic. You know that tightness in your chest. Your mind starts racing and you can’t slow it down to focus on a productive thought. What do I have to teach people? Why do I think I know what’s right for someone else? Why should anyone listen to what I have to say? Am I a fraud? 
 Then it hit me. “Kari, you are your own client,” I said to myself. (I’ll go into what I mean by this a little later, so stay tuned) 
 To answer my own questions for you…I have a lot to teach people. We all have unique experiences and perspectives to share that someone, even just one person, could find invaluable and life-changing, and so do I. 
 I don’t think  I  know what is right for anyone, besides myself. I think that comes from within us. We each already  know  what is right for us, it’s just a matter of acknowledging and accepting it. And sometimes that process can be scary. We might be afraid we’ll lose someone in our lives if we acknowledge we need something different to be happy, or we may change jobs and not know if we’ll be successful, or maybe our acknowledgement and acceptance will take us to a whole new part of the country or world to live out our “right-ness”. What I do know is that I LOVE helping people uncover what is right for them. To help gently guide it into the light and then begin to own it, be proud of it, appreciate it and celebrate it. 
 No one “should” listen to what I have to say. I, and many of my acquaintances, use the saying, “Don’t “should” (aka sh*t) all over yourself.” In other words don’t set yourself up to feel defeated by saying, I should do this or I should be feeling like that. You have to  WANT  to do this and  WANT  to feel like that, and then you make it happen in each of your choices. So no, you “should” not listen to what I have to say unless you  WANT  to make the choice to be a happier, healthier, more fulfilled YOU. 
 I am  not  a fraud. And the reason I can say this with certainty and with confidence is because I whole-heartedly believe everything that has happened in my life has brought me to this point; to help people. I genuinely care about people’s struggles, I get gleefully excited when someone succeeds and feel empathy in the depths of my soul when someone feels alone, helpless or hopeless. It’s not just my life experiences that fuel my passion. I was born this way. 
 Sometimes my connection with a person goes so deep that I feel as though I can feel their pain. I can’t ever know what someone else is fully experiencing, but to give you an example; I saw a video on Facebook the other day. A little girl had a cat who had passed away a few months ago. She missed him terribly. One day her mom had gone out and gotten her a kitten and surprised her with it when she got home from school. They filmed the little girl going into her room and finding the kitten in a large clear box in her room. Her emotions went from inexplicable excitement to inaudible sobbing asking her mommy if she got to keep the kitten and thanking her mom over and over for this kitten. And what do I do? I start sobbing, over this little girl and her kitten. 
 You see, a few months ago my husband and I lost our dog. She was only two and we were devastated, absolutely heartbroken. I could not live without a dog in our house and while it was hard to get a new puppy so quickly, we knew it was what was best for us. So when I saw this little girl with her knew kitten, it hit very close to home for me. 
 We all have these moments if we make the choice to look close enough at ourselves to see how connected we really are to people we may think we have nothing in common with, or think that we can’t relate to what they are going through, or don’t think we have anything to teach them. All of this is to say, the reason I do what I do to help people discover what they love to do is because I have discovered what I love to do… 
 So here we are, back to me being my own client. When I say I am my own client, I don’t want to misrepresent the fact that I have had many teachers, mentors and complete strangers along my path that have helped me discover my own purpose. But I am my own client in the sense that once all those people are gone for the day, the moment or forever, I am the only one who can put those lessons into practice, to make the choices that will make my goals and dreams a reality. No one can do it for me, and I am not here to do the work for you. I am here to guide, challenge and support you just as I have been by individuals and experiences in my life. 
 To finish out my introductory blog to you, I want to leave you with a story about how all things I questioned about myself have manifested answers for me in the past 8 weeks and confirmed that I am going in the right direction. 
 Two months ago I was “released” from my job. That is how it was presented to me, and in some ways it was very fitting because I felt like a prisoner. I deeply cared about the organization that I was working for, but I did not agree with how the C-suite treated, responded and interacted with their employees. Employees were talked about as burdens or ungrateful. Just before I was “released” some changes were being made to address these issues, so they had at least acknowledged that there were issues. Without all the fun details, ultimately I had expressed some thoughts about the changes that were going on and some situations that had come up to use as examples of why these changes to their employee policy were important. My viewpoints were not appreciated and here we are today… 
 I have now started two new jobs. A full-time and a part-time job in addition to my career coaching here! And I could not be happier. Both organizations that I have started with are a complete 180 from where I was, and not just my last employer, but any employer I’ve had…EVER! The organizations VALUE their employees and they make it evident in all their operations, in their benefits packages, in their compensation, all throughout the organization. And the best part…I get to help people! 
 In all my jobs, I get to help people. I am a Health Education Assistant at a community college, so I get to help students register for courses to become a Paramedic or EMT, or take other courses for CPR, First Aid and even babysitting. 
 I am also a job coach for individuals with barriers to independence. I get to support and encourage them as they work toward becoming independent in their employment and meeting their employer’s expectations. 
 And then there’s  you . You’ve gotten this far so maybe there’s a reason. Maybe you’re thinking, “I do think I need a change. Something just doesn’t feel right or feels a little off in my life, and I need some fresh perspective to sift through all of it with me.” Well, that’s what I do best; evaluate, organize and support. I may have lost my job eight weeks ago, but I found myself and a much happier fulfilled version. And I will do everything I can to help you achieve that for yourself! 
 Please come back  next month  where I will dig deeper into  how you can get started on your own transformational journey! 
 Until next month, wishing you many blessings. 
 Oh, and here is the link to that video with the little girl and her kitten. Yes, I watched it again, and cried…again  WATCH THE VIDEO
