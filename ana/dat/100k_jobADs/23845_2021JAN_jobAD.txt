 Job 22 
 1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 
 2 Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself? 
 3 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect? 
 4 Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment? 
 5 Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite? 
 6 For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing. 
 7 Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry. 
 8 But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it. 
 9 Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken. 
 10 Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee; 
 11 Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee. 
 12 Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are! 
 13 And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud? 
 14 Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven. 
 15 Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden? 
 16 Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood: 
 17 Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them? 
 18 Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 
 19 The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn. 
 20 Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth. 
 21 Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee. 
 22 Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart. 
 23 If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles. 
 24 Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks. 
 25 Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver. 
 26 For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God. 
 27 Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows. 
 28 Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways. 
 29 When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person. 
 30 He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.

 “Now yield and submit yourself to Him [agree with God and be conformed to His will] and be at peace; In this way [you will prosper and great] good will come to you. Please receive the law and instruction from His mouth And establish His words in your heart and keep them. If you return to the Almighty [and submit and humble yourself before Him], you will be built up [and restored]; If you remove unrighteousness far from your tents, And place your gold in the dust, And the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks [considering it of little value], And make the Almighty your gold And your precious silver, Then you will have delight in the Almighty, And you will lift up your face to God. You will pray to Him, and He will hear you, And you will pay your vows. You will also decide and decree a thing, and it will be established for you; And the light [of God’s favor] will shine upon your ways. When you are cast down and humbled, you will speak with confidence, And the humble person He will lift up and save. He will even rescue the one [for whom you intercede] who is not innocent; And he will be rescued through the cleanness of your hands.”

 I'm glad that Pastor asks us to ask others what they need before we pray forthem, then can we pray according to their need that they spoke, not coming up to them with preconceived idea of what to pray for, no body knows what A person may be going through and how they are feeling inside, sometimes they might have already said what they need to and now God is ministering to them and we come up all ready to pray, but then in that case I may ask them if it's ok for me to pray with them and ask them if there is something they need prayer for! Jobs friends assumed and it's not right to make assumptions, Lord teach me to pray the way you want me to and help me to remember to Never make assumptions!

 If and when, if and when. If shouldn't be a part of that equation. It never should be a part of our conversation. If God does this I'll come to church; if God does that I'll consider His word and joining in Him. Seek ye first the Kingdom and all shall be added unto you. God isn't looking for the ifs and when's. He is looking for the here and now. This is the time to seek Him; this is the time to get into all of what God has to offer us. I can't Express it enough; Seek ye first the Kingdom. God will heal and redeem me, but He can't when I'm in a what if stage. All the treasure that I could possibly want is in heaven. What is here is fleeting; what is in heavan is everlasting. I am storing up for the everlasting not the fleeting. Thank you Jesus for leading me and being my salvation.

 Job 22 
“When you are cast down and humbled, you will speak with confidence, 
And the humble person He will lift up and save. 
 Lord help us when our friends feel completely down and defeated to be sensitive. To pray diligently for them with them in Love not judgement. Humility in our life not knowing the answer every time someone feels beaten down. Up lifting with a great confidence that together through prayer and reassuring that you are there to listen. Two things time and love . I have time I will make time to listen and I love you. Two greatest things people want..knowing someone cares . Father thank you for the lessons though painful I pray I learn from you daily in relationships so that they will come to know You in Your greatness. 
 Ephesians 4:2 
2 Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love.

 Jobs friends were constantly putting down conditions on what they thought what's wrong with him or what they thought would happen if he had certain stipulations. As human beings our biggest mistake can off and come from false expectations. Thinking that God will fix all of our problems if we abide by certain standards rather than God will just give us peace and walk us through everything. God never once promises us that he will fix everything immediately as soon as we ask but he does promise to be there and that is a promise we can always count on. While it seems that his friends had the right heart their accusations said otherwise. They truly believe that he sinned and that he was being punished and found some type of joy in condemning him. There is one other type of individual that finds joy and condemning us and that is our accuser and adversary, the devil. A lot of this book is wrapped around heart conditions and warning us what could happen by thinking you're holy with not having the right heart

 If you give up your lust for money and throw your precious gold into the river, the Almighty himself will be your treasure. He will be your precious silver! “Then you will take delight in the Almighty and look up to God. You will pray to him, and he will hear you, and you will fulfill your vows to him. You will succeed in whatever you choose to do, and light will shine on the road ahead of you. If people are in trouble and you say, ‘Help them,’ God will save them. Even sinners will be rescued; they will be rescued because your hands are pure.” 
Job 22:24‭-‬30 NLT 
 https://bible.com/bible/116/job.22.24-30.NLT 
 Job's friend is trying his best. But he's not counseling job he's accusing him. And he's putting words in God's mouth saying that God will do all these things but that's really between God and job. But at the very end I do like that he does address intercession. Pray for those that can't pray for themselves. Pull them out of the fire.

 21“Submit to God and be at peace with him; 
in this way prosperity will come to you. 
22Accept instruction from his mouth 
and lay up his words in your heart. 
23If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored: 
If you remove wickedness far from your tent 
24and assign your nuggets to the dust, 
your gold of Ophir to the rocks in the ravines, 
25then the Almighty will be your gold, 
the choicest silver for you. 
26Surely then you will find delight in the Almighty 
and will lift up your face to God. 
27You will pray to him, and he will hear you, 
and you will fulfill your vows.NIV 
 Eliphaz in the beginning of the chapter seemed to talk like any other soul that does not have a relationship with God. He began to question why would Job even think that God was going to approve him in his ways and simply bring judgement to him. We find that in the latter part of this chapter he began to talk like he had some kind of relationship with God. 
 In words of Eliphaz seek first the kingdom of God and he will surely give you peace. With that mind frame he will give prosperity and he will be your silver and gold. In a sense he will be what ever you need him to be. I find that sometimes we need to just trust him above all circumstances and trials will be easier to face when it gets tough. Our flesh will easily question why but if we just hold on and see it from God’s point of view, we will realize that we will make it through it all. 
 Getting back to our first love, the altar and we will begin to be overcomers and conquerors. 
 I love the Kingdom!

 Backsliders can come back to their inheritance -back to the Lord and receive of the many blessings he has for them. They will have powerful prayers and ministries. We must receive them, love them and help them overcome whatever caused them to leave the church. Some were injured in his house, some drawn away for the pleasures of this world, but regardless, he has a plan for their lives and we the church are the intercessors for them. In Jesus name

 “GIVE IN TO GOD, come to terms with him and everything will turn out just fine. LET HIM TELL YOU WHAT TO DO; take his words to heart. Come back to God Almighty and he’ll rebuild your life. CLEAN HOUSE OF EVERYTHING EVIL. RELAX YOUR GRIP ON YOUR MONEY and abandon your gold-plated luxury. God Almighty will be your treasure, more wealth than you can imagine. “You’ll TAKE DELIGHT IN GOD, the Mighty One, and look to him joyfully, boldly. You’ll PRAY TO HIM and he’ll listen; he’ll HELP YOU DO WHAT you’ve PROMISED. You’ll decide what you want and it will happen; your life will be bathed in light. To those who feel low you’ll say, ‘Chin up! Be brave!’ and God will save them. Yes, even the guilty will escape, escape through God’s grace in your life.” 
Job 22:21‭-‬30 MSG 
 WOW, there is so much good advice in this translation. 
1. GIVE IN TO GOD. 
2. LET HIM TELL YOU WHAT TO DO. 
3. Repent and clean house! Don't hold on to any secret sin. 
4. RELAX YOUR GRIP ON YOUR MONEY and stop living luxuriously in self-absorption. 
5. TAKE DELIGHT IN GOD, not in the things off this world. 
6. Pray without ceasing! 
7. Place your dependence on Him alone and He will help you keep your vows and stay clean. 
8. Encourage the down-trodden. 
9. Witness to the lost. 
9. Let others see God's grace in you. 
 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.

 Delight thyself also in the Lord ; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.

 2 Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself? 
3 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect? 
 Why do we do, what we do. 
 First the Kingdom of God. That is the answer. It is to a point for self. Mark 8:36 For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Yes, we seek after Gods Kingdom to serve others, but we must first make it personal. Why are you seeking, what are you seeking for? Greater understanding, how to hear the voice of God, what is it that you are seeking for. 
As we grow, we then can help others, but seek ye first. That ye, means you. Why do you go to church? Why do you seek after a God that you cannot see? Why trust? Because we feel Him, we see what He does in our lives, we talk with Him, we have a relationship with Him. When we seek after His Kingdom, we find not just him, but many wonderful things and we gain so much with a relationship with Him. 
 How is your altar 
Are you seeking First the Kingdom

 The Lord shall save the humble person. That is a great principle that should make us all want to be humble. The only issue for most of us is the pride that stands in our way and the hardest part for most is the humbling part. As long as everything goes our way, its easy going but as soon as someone challenges us its off to the races. 
 We must humble ourselves if we need Gods help.

 AMP - 21 “Now yield and submit yourself to Him [agree with God and be conformed to His will] and be at peace; In this way [you will prosper and great] good will come to you. 
 The antidote for living in complete peace can be found in this verse. Submit yourself to the Lord and peace will follow. Too many of us live our lives in the state of constant uproar. If we would seriously pray and seek the Lord regarding this we would find there is an area of our life that we are not submitted, therefore peace does not reside with us. 
 I choose for my feet to be shod with peace everyday - therefore I must stay under the umbrella of submission.

 Job 22:23-30 (AMP) 
23) If you return to the Almighty ( and submit and humble yourself before him), you will be built up (and restored); If you remove unrighteousness far from your tents, 
24) And place your gold in the dust, And the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks (considering it of little value), 
25) And make the Almighty your gold, And your precious silver, 
26) Then you will have delight in the Almighty, And you will lift up your face to God. 
27) You will pray to Him, and He will hear you, And you will pay your vows. 
28) You will also decide and decree a thing, and it will be established for you; And the light (of God's favor) will shine upon your ways. 
29) When you are cast down and humbled, you will speak with confidence, And the humble person He will lift up and save. 
30) He will even rescue the one (for whom you intercede) who is not innocent; And he will be rescued through the cleanness of your hands. 
 Sounds like REVIVAL to me! 
Return to the Almighty, get back to our First Love, and Seek First His Kingdom. 
Get rid of sin in our life, and submit and humble ourselves before Him, and He will restore (REVIVE) us. 
We can pray to Him, and He will hear our prayers. 
We can walk in authority and decree a thing, and it will be established. 
When we intercede for people that need to be rescued and saved, He will rescue and save them.

 For you have taken pledges from your brother for no reason, and stripped the naked of their clothing: 
 This begins a remarkable list of groundless accusations against Job. He accused Job mainly of greed and cruelty for the sake of riches. None of this was true, but Eliphaz assumed it was because Job was once rich and was now beset by such tragedy. The only evidence he could offer was Job’s condition, and he could not think of another possible explanation for Job’s crisis

 Is it because you’re so pious that he accuses you and brings judgment against you? No, it’s because of your wickedness! There’s no limit to your sins. 
Job 22:4‭-‬5 NLT 
 We cannot be so quick to judge the condition of someone. Yes when one is in sin things will go wrong and blessing will definitely be lacking. Yet it is God who is sovereign and knows what caused it. One is honest enough to say when we are reaping our sinful actions.

 7 Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry. 
Sometimes I feel so bad when the homeless beg for money or food and I have nothing to give or sometimes I feel as though I’m too busy or don’t want to give them the time of day. However, beyond money, beyond actual water, beyond actual food, what are we withholding?? The water of everlasting life or the bread of life, do we give them and encouraging word or an invitation to church?? That should hit harder than not being able to give money or earthly substance. 
28 Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways. 
“God said it, I believe, that’s good enough for me” 
We can speak life into existence, we can speak and heal the sick, encourage a friend, or demand a change. “Decree a thing and it SHALL be established” and a light will shine.

 Could it be that some are more aware of the judgment of God that they forget the grace of God? They forget how God loved them when they returned home. Yet they can't have compassion for a brother that is in need of grace. I pray God baptize us with a fresh burden for souls that regardless of Their offense we could show them love and compassion. In their search for God we could help bring light to their dark path.

 Once again Job's friend comes on the attack without fully understanding where Job is coming from. We should never assume to know what a person in going through or the way we think they should fix it. Our job is to build them up, pray for them and the Lord will bring them the revelation of the what, where and when.

 Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment? 
 5 Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite? 
 6 For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing. 
 7 Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.

 27 You will pray to him, and he will hear you, and you will fulfill your vows to him. 
 Yes, God will hear your prayers. So don't stop praying. Have faith in God, and your prayers will be answered in his time.
