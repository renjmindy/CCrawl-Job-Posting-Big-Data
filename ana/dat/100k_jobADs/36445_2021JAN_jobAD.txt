 Steve Jobs is my hero.

 Just a quick post to see how my new toy is working. Ron surprised me tonight with a new toy: an iPod Touch. It's basically an iPhone without the phone part. 
 I can't decide whether this will increase my productivity or obliterate it. Either way, it's a pretty amazing toy for a girl who grew up thinking of Pong and calculator watches as wonders of modern technology…. 
 Hope your Saturday was full of wonderful surprises, too.
