 Words from Warren 
 Reflections from West Newton, Massachusetts 
   
 Lots of little jobs better than a big job? 
 Today I was sent to a temporary assignment by a staffing company. It was very fun, I enjoyed the people, and since it was only 6 hours start to finish, it was easy to impress. Entry level pay scale but some money is better than no money, right? All things being equal, this could be a fulfilling career. The next step would be to figure out how to live on such a small salary while hoping for consistent opportunities. Thoughts?
