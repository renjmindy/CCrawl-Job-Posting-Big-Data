 Leading architectural and design decisions, mentoring team, writing clean effective code. 
 Role overview 
 We are looking for an experienced Senior Software Engineer to help us build products that fundamentally change the way insurers see the world, enabling them to move from an assumption based understanding of risk, to an empirical, data-driven view. 
 Your role: 
 You will be working on some of the company‚Äôs biggest challenges, including scaling our data processing pipelines (built using GoLang, Python, Spark, ElasticSearch, Docker, GCP and TensorFlow/Keras) 
 We are looking for candidates who are driven to build effective technology solutions that solve significant real world problems. You are a great technologist and regardless of which language you use, you take pride in writing clean, effective code. 
 As a Senior Software Engineer at Cytora, we also expect you to contribute to higher level technical architecture discussions and take opportunities to mentor and coach less experienced colleagues. 
 What your day-to-day would look like: 
 
 Beginning each day with a stand up to synchronise efforts across the team, informed by weekly sprint planning with the whole company 
 Contributing to the refinement our development process, which already includes a well-maintained customer driven feature backlog, strong code review/testing processes and frequent continuous integration driven deploys of production features 
 Working on exciting long-term, high-value projects based on the latest research from the fields of AI and NLP, including work on our low latency event detection system that turns unstructured text streams into a structured dataset of real world events 
 We take pride in test driven development and peer reviewing colleagues‚Äô pull requests to ensure what we build is simple, elegant, reliable and self-documenting 
 Each week includes at least one opportunity for learning, typically in the form of a reading group with a presentation from somebody in your team 
 
 
 What we are looking for in candidates: 
 
 Strong programming skills gained in a production environment - we use Go and Python but are open to Engineers from any background. 
 Proven experience of creating and maintaining Microservices 
 Excellent knowledge of data structures, storage systems and cloud infrastructure (GCP, AWS or Azure) 
 Excellent communication skills, with the ability to articulate detailed technical concepts at a high level 
 
 Bonus points: 
 
 Exposure to machine learning and natural language processing 
 Familiarity with Agile development methodologies (including test driven development and continuous integration) 
 We use Docker/Kubernetes for continuous integration, so familiarity with concepts around containerisation would be useful 
 Experience with mentoring and coaching other less experienced engineers
