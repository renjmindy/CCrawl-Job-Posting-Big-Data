  Learn How To Own EVERY Career Experience  
 J.T. O'Donnell 
 December 17, 2019 
   
 Today, I want to talk to you about owning all of your career experiences—100% of them, all of the good ones and bad ones. So, where is this coming from? Well, this week I'm talking to you about your career narrative, your career story. 
 
 The Good And The Bad 
 Your career story is the collection of career experiences that you've had. I'll be focusing specifically on this idea of owning every experience. I'm talking about the  bad  ones. 
 If you got fired, if you got laid off, if you had a co-worker that was a bully, if you had a boss that took advantage of you   , y   ou're going to own it! 
 I've been teaching this for over 15 years.The first time people hear this, they say, "JT, I'm not owning that, I didn't do that to myself. I didn't ask for that." 
 To that I say, your fear comes from the idea that you think I'm telling you to admit that you were wrong. It's not what I'm saying! Not at all. What I'm saying is that you need to own everything that's happened to you in your life with respect to your career. 
 The Things That Aren't So Good? Those ARE The Good Things.

 Now, we have no problem owning the good things. We love taking credit for the good things. The things that aren't so good, we tend to want to shy away from them because of how it makes us feel and look. 
 I want you to own those experiences because when you do, you are taking the power back.  You are saying, "I don't like what happened to me, but it was a powerful experience." 
 When you own something, you're saying, "I'm going to apply what I've learned and I'm going to use this to my advantage." The most successful people you know own everything that happened to them. The things that aren't so good? Those  are  the good things. 
 Fulfill Your Real Potential! 
 Those not-so-good career experiences are the powerful experiences that you can say, "This doesn't define me. It doesn't end here. I didn't lose." 
 When you recognize that and you can confidently say,  "I own everything that's happened to me, good or bad,"  that's where the real power begins. 
 This is how I get people to catapult their careers because they stop hanging onto the negativity associated with those experiences. It's paralyzing them. They're not making good decisions and they're not taking chances in their careers. They're not fulfilling their  real potential . 
 Instead, you say, "I own it, it happened to me." Now we're talking my friends! 
 Hiring Managers Can Spot This From A Mile Away

 I'm going to teach you the technique that I have literally taught thousands of people in the Work It Daily program. The upside of owning this stuff is the fact that it's a super attractive trait that recruiters and hiring managers can spot a mile away. 
 That's who you want on your team because those are the problem solvers.  Every employer wants that on their squad. 
 I am going to teach you how to present yourself as one of those people. It's a career changer and it's what's going to ultimately help you rewrite your entire career story to get better results. 
 I Will Help 1 Million People In 2020 
 My mission in 2020 is to help 1 million people on LinkedIn grow their careers. I'm going to be doing that through the newsletter platform, but I'm going to need your help. I need to spread the message that we can all take ownership of our careers. 
 We need to work on our careers, not just in our jobs.  If that's resonating with you and you know someone that needs help working on their career, share this with them! It's all free! It's all happening over on LinkedIn. 
 We're educating people on the  new rules of career success  and what you need to do to be successful. Nobody taught us this, school didn't teach us this. 
 So, if you want to learn how to own your career experiences,  change your career story , and grow your career, we'll show you how!
