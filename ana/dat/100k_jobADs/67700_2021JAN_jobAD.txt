 https://t.me/HistoricalPics/6926  This is one of the photographs from the collection of George Ackerman’s nearly forty year career documenting the lives of rural America for the US Department of Agriculture…… Ackerman would claim that he took over 50,000 photographs, they are a very candid look at a way of life that may be gone, but thanks to his efforts it’s now preserved for all time……Today we’ll share a few of these images of our past, hope you enjoy them  #AceHistoryNews
