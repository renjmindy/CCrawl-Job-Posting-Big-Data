 Every Company Has Problems (& three other points to consider before leaving your job) 
 Posted by  samanthancitro  on  November 11, 2017November 11, 2017 
 It's fall, which means change is in the air. Or, at least, the itch for change. But how do you know if it's an itch you should scratch or not? Before you quit, consider the following: 
 1. Every Company Has Problems 
 Whatever yours are, they're probably not unique. Difficult boss? Yup, everyone has one. Poor Q3 performance? Success is cyclical. Lack of clear goals? Check, check, check. Instead of picking apart the problems, look critically at how your company assesses and addresses them. If you're working in a culture of open, honest, analytical assessment that leads to change, the individual problems are going to be temporary. 
 2. Don't Do Things, Build Things 
 What we're learning, as technology evolves and rote tasks are easier to automate, is that humans feel most fulfilled when we're building something. Even if your job is to be the task doer, you can build a system for categorizing and prioritizing those tasks. Do a quick mental shift from "doer" to "builder" and see if you feel more fulfilled. 
 3. You'll Never Have Optimal "Work - Life Balance" 
 So let's just get that out of the way now. Everyone wants to make a ton of money and work three days a week. If that's your life, stop reading this article and sink your claws as deep into that job as you can. For the rest of us, we're never going to spend as much time with our dogs as we want or work our self-proclaimed 'optimal hours' of noon to six. What we can have is a full and balanced life, which comes when we do work that fulfills us. Write down what your realistic best life looks like, and work toward that. 
 4. Come for the People, Stay for the People 
 We spend more time with our colleagues than we do with our families, so choose wisely. If you want to grow, surround yourself with people who are better and smarter than you are. Most importantly, surround yourself with good people who share your values. Does your team check those boxes? Think twice before you leave a group of good people behind - they're harder to come by than you'd think. 
 If after reading this you still have one foot out the door, you should probably go. To do your best work, you have to be passionate and committed. If you're not, it's best for you and your company for you to leave.
