 BACKBASE IN AMSTERDAM

 Where it all began! Two guys, our founder Jouk and his partner, set out on a mission “to make the internet more beautiful”.

Working in software engineering, sales, marketing, academy or business support, we have a great team that’s driving our growth. 
 Located in Amsterdam-Oost (East), our EMEA HQ offices are a stone’s throw away from the beautiful Tropenmuseum, the Amsterdam Royal Zoo and famous windmill brewery Brouwerij ‘t IJ. Famous for its breathtaking architecture, canals, and over 881,000 bikes, Amsterdam is a city that’s easy to fall in love with.

 CULTURE 
 Our Amsterdam office is home to people from all over the world working in small, lean teams. Loud and busy sometimes but always friendly, helpful, and super fun. We love to celebrate each other’s achievements, share jokes, and our love for food, movies, traveling, and sports. We’re one big and diverse family working towards the same goal. 
 With graffiti of Marilyn Monroe and Pulp Fiction stars John Travolta, and Samuel L. Jackson looking cool on our walls, you can probably guess that we love entertainment. From games nights and parties to boat rides and Dj gigs - you name it, we have it.
