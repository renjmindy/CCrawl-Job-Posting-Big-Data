  Why Starting A Blog Could Help Your Job Search

 We’ve all heard about how  5 Tips To Create A Great Professional Blog  can benefit writers who are looking to publish their work, but what if you’re not a writer? Could blogging still benefit you? In what ways? **RELATED: ** 5 Tips To Create A Great Professional Blog  Blogging is more than writing your thoughts and feelings about a topic you’re passionate about. In fact, blogging could entail many things. You could post videos, photos, infographics, and any other creations you can think of. You can offer help, post tutorials, and even earn money in some instances. Whatever you choose to produce when starting a blog, if taken seriously, it could be a great way to showcase your work as a professional. 
 
 Why Starting A Blog Could Help Your Job Search 
 As the demand to build an online presence in order to be more visible to potential employers grows, it isn’t enough to simply have social media profiles. If you want to have a bigger presence on the Internet, starting a blog could definitely help you in your  5 Tips To Create A Great Professional Blog . In an interview with Annabel Candy, creator of travel blog  5 Tips To Create A Great Professional Blog  and blogging tips site  5 Tips To Create A Great Professional Blog , the expert blogger shared why she got into blogging and web design. “I studied for an MA in Design for Interactive Media in 1995 because I had no idea about computers, but realized that I needed to get up to speed fast,” said Candy. “The Internet was so new then, I really had no idea what opportunities it would lead to but it's opened up so many doors for me.” Because of the flexibility blogging provides, you can practically work with anyone and from anywhere, which can be beneficial when you’re looking to build a larger professional network. This rings true especially when you’re unemployed. Not having a steady income can really limit what you spend your money on. Sometimes you don’t have gas money to attend the job fair in your neighboring city or other networking events. Blogging can help you go virtual with your networking and it costs nothing. In addition, blogging is a good way to “differentiate yourself from most job seekers,” said Candy. “It's a chance to show that you're unique, passionate and prepared to take risks.” These are all good qualities to have when looking for work. It’s so hard to stand out from the job seeking pool when everyone around you is dressed as professionally as you, has a good cover letter, resume, references, and then some. “The Wordpress 2010 and 2011 themes aren't a bad way to start,” said Candy. Keeping a blog “clean and simple” are also good things to keep in mind when starting a blog. Even if you don’t have blogging experience this should be easy to follow. Think of blogging as you do about your job interviews, always looking for ways to make that good first impression. “First impressions count and are hard to change so keep your language clean as well as your design,” said Candy. If you haven’t explored the benefits blogging could provide, now is a good time to start. It can build your confidence, and help advertise your skills in ways other Internet sites cannot.
