 Job 26 
 1 But Job answered and said, 
 2 How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength? 
 3 How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is? 
 4 To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee? 
 5 Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof. 
 6 Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering. 
 7 He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing. 
 8 He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them. 
 9 He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it. 
 10 He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end. 
 11 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof. 
 12 He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud. 
 13 By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent. 
 14 Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?

 14 “Yet these are just the fringes of His ways [mere samples of His power], The faintest whisper of His voice! Who can contemplate the thunder of His [full] mighty power?” (AMP)

 AMP - 10 “He has inscribed a circular limit (the horizon) on the face of the waters At the boundary between light and darkness. 
 There is a boundary between light and darkness that was created at the very beginning of time. God said let there be light and light was separated from darkness immediately. 
 In our lives there has to be separation from light and darkness as well. We must separate the two. How can children of light walk in darkness, likewise how can children of darkness walk in the light? 
 We must protect the Spirit of God in our lives (light) from the wiles of the enemy and the ways of the world. We cannot put on carnality and remain children of the light. We cannot play with sin. He has called us out of darkness to walk in the light, why would someone want to go back to the ways of the world and bring darkness of sin back into their lives? 
 We must keep the light of His spirit alive within us, and keep the darkness at sin and the world at bay.

 7. He stretches out the northern sky over vast reaches of emptiness; He hangs the earth itself on nothing. 
 14. And all of this, all of these are the mere edges of His capabilities. We are privy to only a whisper of His power. Who then dares to claim understanding of His thunderous might? The Voice 
 As Bro. Emory reminded us, God fills the universe, yet we can fit everything we know about Him into a bottle cap!

 13 By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent. 
 Verse 12 reveals that there is power in His spoken Word. He spoke the Word and divided the sea. Thanks we to God that we have Hus Word and access to that same power. 
 As the song as says: 
I can see 
Waters raging at my feet 
I can feel 
The breath of those surrounding me 
I can hear 
The sound of nations rising up 
We will not be overtaken 
We will not be overcome 
 I can walk 
Down this dark and painful road 
I can face 
Every fear of the unknown 
I can hear 
All God’s children singing out 
We will not be overtaken 
We will not be overcome 
 The same power that rose Jesus from the grave 
The same power that commands the dead to wake 
Lives in us, lives in us 
The same power that moves mountains when He speaks 
The same power that can calm a raging sea 
Lives in us, lives in us 
He lives in us, lives in us 
 We have hope 
That His promises are true 
In His strength 
There is nothing we can’t do 
Yes, we know 
There are greater things in store 
We will not be overtaken 
We will not be overcome 
 Greater is He that is living in me 
He’s conquered our enemy 
No power of darkness 
No weapon prevails 
We stand here in victory

 NOTHING HIDES 
 6 Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering. 
 The revelation of eternal judgement is revealed here. Consider the fact that hell is death or the place of the dead. Seeing that hell is naked before him, this means that even though a person is lost, dies and is judged to hell, they will never escape the knowledge of GOD. It is intriguing for me to consider that GOD will concern himself with the happenings in hell, further proving that lucifer is no god at all. But simply a vessel in the control of our GOD JESUS. 
 We are wise to choose to serve the ONE GOD JESUS and bypass all the hopeless counterfeits. The eye of the LORD will forever be upon us.

 This chapter is captioned MSG "God Sets a Boundary Between Light and Darkness". John 12:35 AMP says "So Jesus said to them, “The Light is among you [only] a little while longer. Walk while you have the Light [keep on living by it], so that darkness will not overtake you. He who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going [he is drifting aimlessly]. John 12:35-36 MSG says " Jesus said, “For a brief time still, the light is among you. Walk by the light you have so darkness doesn’t destroy you. If you walk in darkness, you don’t know where you’re going. As you have the light, believe in the light. Then the light will be within you, and shining through your lives. You’ll be children of light.”

 Job 26:7-10 & 14 (NLT) 
7) God stretches the northern sky over empty space and hangs the earth on nothing. 
8) He wraps the rain in his thick clouds, and the clouds don't burst with the weight. 
9) He covers the face of the moon, shrouding it with his clouds. 
10) He created the horizon when he seperated the waters; he set the boundary between day and night. 
 
 These are just the beginning of all that he does, merely a whisper of his power. Who, then, can comprehend the thunder of his power?

Nothing is hidden he can see that lake of fire and the destruction hath no covering. Its no secret what hells all about. I knew about hell when i was in the world…before my holy ghost birthday… 
I was terrified i knew if i died i was gonna be burning FOREVER! it was no secret so dont sugar coat it!

but how little a portion is heard of him?

 Francis Chan said "if God were an ocean, and your brain was a can. If you filled your brain with absolutely everything you could about God until it overflowed then you would have yet to scratch the surface of who God is, if God is an ocean." 
 Those is eternity that made it are truly kicking themselves wishing they had done more, given more, and spent more time with the Lord. 
 Imagine how they feel sitting in the presence of Almighty God. 
 Trust and obey him. It is well worth the ride. 
 1 Corinthians 2:9 (KJV Strong's) 
9 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.

 This are the begining of all that he does. Our God is all powerful. At his voice and command were the things created in this world. Im am reminded of this scripture: 
“I am the Lord , the God of all the peoples of the world. Is anything too hard for me?

 There is something to be said about how GOD controls everything. GOD can be the power in the arm that has no strength. When GOD was manifest in the flesh; he hand picked disciples to help grow the kingdom of GOD. What a mighty move of GOD in my life. Over the last couple days I was ready to give up. GOD has shown me that it was my flesh getting in the way. I had allowed the enemy to take one small situation and twist it inside me. I believe that it is not for me to understand the full power of our LORD. Just like it says at the end of verse 14: but the thunder of his power who can understand? Man GOD is awesome……Thank you Jesus…..Amen!!!!

 We will never understand the power of God. We are privileged to feel it and see it. What a Almighty God we serve! I hear the sound of an abundance of rain and the thunder of his power. Their is nothing that can stand before the greatness of his strength. When the enemy comes in like a flood the Lord sets up a standard against him. Their is no depth too deep no situation too great the Lord cannot reach us and change. If we determine within ourselves to follow God with our whole heart He will fight for us. God will go before us when those you though we're loyal to you leave you behind. He will stand by us when no one else will. He will lift us up when everyone else knocks us down and uses us. Greater is He who is in me than he who is in the world! I serve the God that made the entirety of it and not one inch belongs to the enemy. Stand for God and he will make us victorious.

 Alot of time we find ourselves without having strength, God always gives us strength, he counsels us when we need him, we have to trust in him, in some situations it's hard to trust in people, let alone God, but I've learned that He is the only one to trust in,he provides for us, he heals us, he delivers us! He's there, when you look around and there's no one there, and your all alone, Gods there! I know this, because I've been alone, but I knew he was there! MY GOD IS AWESOME!

 How little do we actually know of Gods power and his very essence? We can describe the most amazing things he's done on this earth and not even begin to scratch the surface of who he is. Who can understand the thunder of his power? Sounds like we can't even begin to fathom the sound of his power, much less his actual power. Our God can do so much more than we can imagine, why do we doubt his ability to handle our situations?

 14 Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand? 
 How little we know about God. God has demonsions that no one has tapped into. This is why it is so dangerous to be a know it all in the kingdom of God. Brother Emery said he is a ever revelating God. He continues to reveal himself to us on different ways. The more we study the word and share the revelations the more we understand him. When you feel like your mind has just been blown with revelation of him, you are just at the tip of the iceberg.

 Where do we sit between good and evil? Can you see the fence in the distance because you ran from it after sitting on it for so long? He separates the world into light and darkness. I choose to serve the Light and know that God has destroyed my fence and I no longer have to worry about the God that I serve. He has delivered me. Hell has no hold on me!

 1-4 “Well, you’ve certainly been a great help to a helpless man! You came to the rescue just in the nick of time! What wonderful advice you’ve given to a mixed-up man! What amazing insights you’ve provided! Where in the world did you learn all this? How did you become so inspired? 
 To me, Job is being a bit facetious. If anyone has a right to, it would be Job in these circumstances. However, it may be an indication that his friends lack experience in Godly relationships. These friends may be very intelligent but are in effect Godly immature. What Job needs to hear from his friends is reminders from the words of God. 
 Deuteronomy 31:6 - Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD thy God, he [it is] that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. 
 Hebrews 13:5 - [Let your] conversation [be] without covetousness; [and be] content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. 
 Joshua 1:9 - Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God [is] with thee whithersoever thou goest. 
 1 Peter 5:7 - Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you. 
 If we find we are the friends of someone who is battling, let’s not “pile-on” or be a Captain Obvious. Instead let’s build each other up with the Word of God.
