 tinywords  , 12.1, November 2012 
 Today, I woke up to find my tanka on  tinywords . And for that, I say, thank you to Peter Newton, who is editing this issue of the wonderful online journal. If you haven't already discovered  tinywords  , I encourage you to do so. You can sign up to have new offerings delivered straight to your e-mail inbox, so you never have to miss out on the diverse collection of poetry and poets featured there. 
 I have so much to be thankful for this year, and that's what I'll be reflecting on when I sit down later today for a traditional turkey dinner with my family. There won't be as many people physically occupying seats at our table this year as in the past. Several of our loved ones have passed, and those remaining are scattered in different locations. But I always am grateful for their presence in my life, and the love and encouragement they have given me over the years. 
 Today, I also feel truly blessed to have found a warm, creative and thoughtful extended family of friends and poets from all over the world. Happy Thanksgiving to all!

 About Margaret Dornaus 
 I’m a writer and a teacher, as well as a haiku-doodler. I live in a beautiful woodland setting, surrounded by native oak forests, that inspires me to record haiku snapshots of luna moths and our resident roadrunner, and even an occasional black bear as it hightails it across the top of my road, my mongrel dog barking at its heels as I watch with wonder. My work as a travel writer has appeared in publications from The Dallas Morning News to the Robb Report. You can find examples of my travel writing–as well as excerpts from a travel memoir I’m working on–at my other WordPress site, Travelin’ On. What more than that do you need to know? Only that I started this blog with an eye toward collaboration. Got a haiku? Send it my way. . . . I’m all about new visions & voices. Best, Margaret
