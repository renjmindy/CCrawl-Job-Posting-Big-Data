  Had Weird Job Interview, What Did It Mean?  
 Work It Daily 
 July 21, 2009 
 Dear Experts, I had this weird job interview, I was hoping you could help me decipher what it all means. I was interviewing for one of six open jobs at a company in an industry that has seen a ton of layoffs. Their first question was about why I wanted to join the company. I answered. Then they asked me right away if I had questions about the position as well as the company. I asked them. Then they went on and on about the new vision they have for the company for 20 minutes...and didn't ask me anymore questions! I have never been to an interview where they did all the talking. There were no questions for me. Isn't the whole purpose of an interview to ask the person being interviewed questions about why they are good for the position? It was all about the interviewers. By the time they said "Ok, interview is over," I had to beg them to ask me a question! After I begged them, they asked me about a freelance piece I had in my portfolio, and asked why I had sold it to another company rather than their own. I don't know what to think at all! I haven't heard back a yes or no from them yet, but I can't stop thinking about how this was such a weird interview. Any light you can shed is appreciated!  Here is how our T.A.P. experts answered this question:   Q#213  Remember 2 interview THEM; use their chat as launch 4 you 2 cite ur exper, ways u'd fit in, add value ( @juliaerickson )  Q#213  Interviewers r nt always experts at interviewing. Follw up w thnk u note. Call 2 clarify interest in pos nd ans ? ( @kgrantcareers )  Q#213  You had a bad interviewer. There are incompetent interviewers just like there are incompetent everything elses. ( @askamanager )  Q#213  They were probably testing you to see how well you handled "odd" situations. Best to just be yourself in this case. ( @gradversity )  Q#213  Sounds like non-stop talk was to sell you on them. ? about project seems like hint/where to sell your next. ( @teenarose )  Q#213  Seems like interview was so strange, why would u want 2 work there? Consider environment and job that is right 4 u. ( @DebraWheatman )  Q#213  Screening interview-they found out what needed: Why you want job, if U prepared. Next time, go w/flow. ( @keppie_careers )  Our Twitter Advice Project (T.A.P.) is no longer an active campaign.
