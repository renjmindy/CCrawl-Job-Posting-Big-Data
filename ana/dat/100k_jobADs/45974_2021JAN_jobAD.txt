 Now BIGGER and BETTER. 
 “The rocket is on the launch pad and you are ready for lift-off in 2018. Leo are all set and ready to go, there is a sense of excitement and anticipation in the air and a certain electricity coursing through your veins. Things cannot be rushed however, preparation is essential and you need to make sure your base is solid and super secure. 2018 is about building on what you have, having more faith in what you have done and taking that to a super sonic new level. Your focus and determination are sharpened and you have greater stamina and also the will to fine tune talents and weaponise those abilities. You can really on support from family, your fan base or your followers to propel you into orb 
 it. A time to prepare for great success, visibility and even fame. Love dalliances that begin can quickly turn into firm friendships and solid relationships which provide great structure and security in your life. While the outside world is filled with fire works, family and love keep your feet on the ground.” 
 A big thank you to all the amazon and B&N buyers who supported me over the past 4 years and also to my youtube channel subscribers.
