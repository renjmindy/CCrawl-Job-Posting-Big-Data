 DESCRIPTION 
 These work boots made by Bata Industrials are always water resistant. For gumboots it’s very important that they have anti slip features. Wet environments are often slippery, so anti slip protection is a must have. In some occasions gumboots are also used in highly disinfected environments, such as kitchens and butcheries. Bata Industrials gumboots are made in Australia.
