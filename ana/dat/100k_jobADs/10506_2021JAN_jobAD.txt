 Pay Yourself a V.I.S.I.T Before Deciding on Your Next Career Move 
 Have you ever found yourself in a job role that you absolutely hated? Or, perhaps a role that left you drained and uninspired? What about a job role where you are consistently under-performing and putting your employment at risk? Often we find ourselves in these situations because we skipped the step of defining what we  really  want before deciding on a job or career. 
 Knowing your own preferences is the first step to finding your ideal job role. As a career coach, to help my clients do that most effectively, I developed the V.I.S.I.T FrameworkÂ© and an associated toolkit. The goal in using the framework and tools is to help individuals clearly define their work preferences. The framework facilitates self reflection, leading to a more thoughtful, strategic and meaningful job choice. 
 The V.I.S.I.T framework is an easy-to- use model that identifies each component of the self-exploration process, which includes prioritizing your   V  alues, gaining   I  nsight from past experiences, assessing your   S  kills, clarifying your   I  nterests and discovering your   T  alents. 
 The Components of V.I.S.I.T Defined 
 Values  are strongly held beliefs about what is important, valuable and acceptable to you. Independence, loyalty, fairness, and hard work are examples of values. Having a value conflict in a job role can cause internal strife and stress and ultimately lead to job dissatisfaction. Having a clear understanding of what your values are and aligning them to your job and work environment of choice can help ensure that you are making the right job choice. 
 Insight  is the clarity that comes from self reflection on past experiences. These could be good experiences or bad experiences. For example, in completing an Insight exercise, you may discover patterns that point to a preference to work with external vs. internal customers or that you need to be around people to thrive. These insights become an important consideration as you identify future job roles. 
 Skills  are your well-honed abilities. Skills are gained through experience, knowledge and practice. Skills are an important consideration in defining your ideal job role as we tend to be happier and more fulfilled when we can regularly do what we are good at doing while making a difference in our work. In addition, understanding the skills that are required for a job and comparing them to your skillset will help you to complete a gap analysis to determine what you will need to improve to be successful in that job. 
 Interests  are what you enjoy doing. Have you ever been asked about what you would do if money was of no concern? The answers generally fall in the area of what interests you. As you think about the ideal job role, understanding your interests and working to identify a role that allows you to align your interests to the job can help satisfy your need to be fulfilled in your work. 
 Talents  are the areas where you naturally and often effortlessly excel. Engaging in work that comes naturally for you can aid in your overall work efficacy. In addition, having valuable talents can help you to move up the career ladder as well as help you to command a higher salary due to your ability to perform. 
 So, before you decide on your next career move, don't forget to stop and pay yourself a V.I.S.I.T to help improve your chances of future fulfillment and success.
