 15 Online Jobs You Can Do with Absolutely No Experience 
 
 Bridget 
  __ April 16, 2020   
 
 Now more than ever, people are looking for ways to make money from home. 
 One of the best things about working from home is that you don't need prior experience to get started. You can successfully make money online, even if you're a beginner. That's great news if you want to make some extra cash but don't have a lot of experience in the workforce. 
 One of these jobs can also be a good start if you want to pivot from your current profession and start a brand new career. 
 How Much Will One of These Beginner Jobs Pay? 
 There's a great deal of variety among the online jobs that hire with no experience, and as such, you can expect a varied outlook in terms of pay. In general, though, you'll find that jobs in which you work for yourself (freelancing jobs) pay much better than jobs through a company. 
 If you find your own clients, you're free to charge whatever you see fit. As long as the customer is willing to pay your fee, you're good to go! In contrast, when you're hired as a contract worker through an online company, you're usually paid per hour or per project. This isn't often a high hourly rate, so it can take you longer to make good money going this route. 
 That's why I love freelance work so much and recommend it to everyone who wants to make money from home! 
 Online Jobs for Beginners with No Experience 
 When you're searching for an online job for beginners, there is one thing to keep in mind: competition may be stiff. 
 Finding one of these online jobs may take a little legwork and a lot of patience at first, but don't give up. 
 If you need extra cash right away, you can start with one of the lower-paying jobs that are generally easier to get into, like online surveys. 
 Then, while you're making some cash from the surveys, you can put work into  setting up a freelance business  or applying for other work at home jobs. 
 While these jobs are all very different, they all share a common thread: they're all fun and flexible. 
 There is something really thrilling about making money from home, especially when you're your own boss. 
 These jobs allow you to work whenever and wherever you want. You don't get that kind of freedom when you're stuck in an office!

 Online Survey Jobs 
 If you need to pocket some extra cash while you're getting started with work from home jobs, online survey jobs can be a good source of that extra income. Typically, these surveys will ask you to give your opinion of certain brands or to tell your experience with various products. 
 Most surveys only pay a few dollars at a time, but this can quickly add up. Surveys are generally easy to do and they are really flexible, which means you can answer questions when you have free time or a few minutes here and there. 
 For the best results, sign up with as many survey companies as possible. To get started, check out some of these top legitimate online survey companies:

 Swagbucks

 Freelance Writing 
 Freelance writing is one of the highest-paying jobs you can do without any prior experience. In fact, some writers make upwards of six figures each year, just working from home! 
 I started working online as a freelance writer ten years ago without ever having written professionally, which is why I highly recommend this as a job for beginners! 
 If you're a beginner, you don't need previous experience to get work as a writer, but if you want to be successful you do need to have good writing abilities. While this is important, it's also important not to let a fear of lack of ability keep you from getting started. The best way to improve your writing is to do it as often as possible. 
 There are several content marketplaces where you can get started, including Crowd Content and Textbroker. These are places where you can get your start, but they aren't good for long-term work. (  I discuss this more here  ). 
 Alternatively, you can strike out on your own and start freelancing with your own clients. While this method does require more legwork upfront, it pays much better in the long run. 
 My friend Elna is a very successful freelance writer who started from home without any experience. If you want to start making money with this work at home job, I highly recommend her  freelance writing course .

 Virtual Assistant 
 You don't need any previous experience to work as a virtual assistant. Instead, take the skills and know-how you already have and package those services to offer to clients. 
 Here are just a few things you could offer as a virtual assistant (even as a beginner!): 
 
 Content writing 
 Email management 
 Social media management 
 Appointment scheduling 
 eCommerce packaging and shipping 
 Customer service 
 Blog management

 The great thing about working as a virtual assistant is that the sky is the limit as to the things you can offer. Clients don't care if you have professional experience, they only care that you know how to get the job done. 
 Abbey at  The Virtual Savvy  has lots of tools to help you learn how to start a business as a virtual assistant. I highly recommend you check her out! 
 Transcription Jobs 
 Transcription involves listening to audio files and then turning into written documents. 
 You don't need any experience to get a transcription job, but you do need to have patience and good typing skills. 
 To start, you could look at one of the popular at-home transcription companies like Rev or Quicktake. While these are good, they are also very low-paying, which can be frustrating. 
 The best way to succeed as a transcriber is to have proper business training. Janet Shaughnessy can help you with that. She's successfully built her own six-figure transcription business right from home. 
 Check out her  free course  to learn more about transcription as a work from home job. 
 Proofreading 
 As long as you've got a good grasp on English grammar, you can be a proofreader from home, even as a beginner. As a proofreader, you'll double-check things like articles, books, and transcripts to make sure there are no errors. 
 You don't need to have experience to succeed in this job, but you do need to have a keen eye and a solid understanding of the English language. 
 According to Glassdoor, proofreaders average nearly $45,000 per year. That's great news for beginners who want to make money from home. 
 Perhaps the most difficult thing about proofreading is knowing where to start. How do you break into this field as a beginner? That's where  Proofreading Academy  can help. This company offers complete and comprehensive training for proofreaders, and they even guarantee you a job if you pass their course. 
 Check out the [ Proofreading Academy training ](https://workathomesavvy.com/proofread academy) to learn how you can get started with this beginner job. 
 Online Tutoring 
 Online tutoring is a good way to help others and make money right from home. There are many online tutoring jobs available and while some require prior teaching experience, not all do. 
 If you have a knack for teaching others you can get this kind of job even as a beginner. 
 These types of jobs run the gamut, from teaching English to schoolchildren in Asia to tutoring high school students preparing for the SAT. 
 Head to my article  The Best Online Tutoring Jobs from Home  for a list of companies that hire work from home tutors. 
 Data Entry 
 Data entry jobs involve taking data and consolidating it so that companies can use it. You don't need to have prior experience to do data entry jobs online, but you do need to have good typing skills and an eye for detail. 
 While there are plenty legitimate data entry companies out there, this is also one field where you'll find a lot of scams. Keep in mind that you should never pay to do data entry work. It's also always a smart idea to research a data entry company first, just to make sure you don't see any red flags. 
 Some popular remote data entry companies include DionData Solutions, Working Solutions, and SigTrack.

 Online Test Scoring Jobs

 Search Engine Evaluator 
 Working as a search engine evaluator is a very flexible job for beginners.

 Look at  Appen  and  Lionbridge  if you're interested in finding out more. 
 Online Juror 
 Did you know that you can get paid to work as a virtual juror? 
 While you won't sit in on actual court cases from home, you can play a role in helping attorneys prepare for trial. Often, these attorneys will turn to mock jurors to prepare for their case. 
 You'll give important feedback to the attorney, and offer a good clue as to how things might go during the actual court case. 
 To sign up, visit  Virtual Jury . Selection is random, as it depends on what type of juror the attorney is looking for. Pay isn't huge â€“ typically $10 to $60 per trial â€“ but it's a good way to make some extra money without any prior experience. 
 Website and Application Testing 
 As a web tester, you'll be asked to evaluate and share your thoughts on different software or beta products. This might be trying it out for a time period and then giving feedback as to the design, layout, and user experience. 
 This kind of job is super easy, which means competition is steep. Still, if you can get a gig it's a great way to make some extra money. Some popular web testing sites include Enroll, UserTesting, and Analysia. 
 Social Media Manager 
 If you know you're way around social media, you have what it takes to be a social media manager. This job involves managing the social media presence for businesses, companies, or organizations. 
 This means creating and maintaining accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. While on these platforms you may have to regularly schedule things, answer comments, and even provide customer service support. 
 You can offer this service on your own as a freelancer or search job boards for a remote position in-house somewhere. 
 Pinterest Manager 
 This is similar to a social media manager, but not quite the same. 
 While you might think of Pinterest as a social platform, it's actually used as a powerful marketing tool for many businesses. Many organizations and entrepreneurs use the Pinterest platform to drive traffic to their website or business. 
 Using Pinterest in such a way requires a dedicated marketing strategy. That's where a Pinterest manager comes in. 
 While Pinterest is a marketing tool, you certainly don't need any marketing experience to offer this service to businesses. What you do need is a thorough knowledge of how this platform works, an understanding of how to make quality-looking pins, and the ambition to use your knowledge to help entrepreneurs. 
 Customer Service Representative 
 Many businesses need customer service help, and an increasing number are turning to remote workers to fulfill their customer service positions. You do not need to have any prior experience to get this entry-level job, but you do need to have a pleasant demeanor and excellent communication skills. 
 As a customer service agent, you'll act as the face of the company or organization. You'll need to have an extensive knowledge of the products and services of the company you're working for, and you'll need to know how to help resolve customer's issues. 
 The best way to find a remote customer service position is to search job search boards like Indeed or Career Finder. 
 Blogging 
 There is absolutely no experience required to work from home as a blogger, but this job does come with a catch: You can make amazing money by blogging, but it doesn't come quickly. 
 There is a lot of hard work required if you want run a successful blog, and that's why I've put it last on the list. 
 This isn't a get-rich-quick career, but it does have unlimited earning potential. It's worth including because it is one of the best ways to make money from home without any prior experience.

 This is great! I'm currently trying to find a job but I want something that doesn't involve going outside. I don't want to expose anyone in my family to coronavirus by some chance I catch it. This is very informational and I'm definitely going to look into some of these.
