Pulled from the Trash 
 
My new plant stand 
 
In process 
 Pulled from the TrashI know, I know…you are probably rolling your eyes just like my husband did and wondered "Why in the world would anyone want THAT?" I seem to get a lot of those comments. It really isn't anything new to me. It seems that I have always been a little odd and, according to my mom, do things that "normal people just don't do." I like to call it: Thinking outside the box. I saw this little cart and thought it would make a cute plant stand. I mean, if it didn't work out, I could stick it out on the curb anyway, right? So, I stripped the paint off of it, sanded off the rust, primed and repainted it. I was quite proud of the result…..ta da! My new plant stand! 
 Norma: 
This cart was metal and rusty. So, I took it apart and put the screws in a jar (I am notorious for losing things). I then laid it out on newspaper outside and took a non-plastic (plastic will melt) cheap paint brush and applied Klean Strip-Premium Stripper. I let it sit for an hour (I think -- there is a new Klean strip out, it turns a color when it is time to take the paint off. It worked great on my door…totally blonde proof), and then scraped the paint off. The paint came off pretty easily and exposed the bare metal. I then sanded all of it (trays and legs, etc) with medium sandpaper and then fine sandpaper (electric hand sander). Since it was rusty, I spray painted the the trays and legs with Rustoleum's Rusty Metal Primer. After that dried, I painted the legs one color (white). I used a Rustoleum spray paint that works well on metal. I did the same thing for the trays, I painted them another color (red). So far, I have watered my plants and the tray has gotten wet, but the paint has not peeled, puckered or anything. Overall, I am satisfied with my $5 tray! Hope this helps. If I did not answer a question, let me know!

 It turned out really cute! And I wouldn't roll my eyes-just the other day I was dumpster-diving behind a law office that's being remodeled. All the good stuff was broken, though.

 ANDREA! WE ARE TRULY KINDRED SPIRITS! I AM A HOUSE-PLANT ADDICT AND YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE ALL THE ITEMS I HAVE TURNED INTO PLANTERS OR PLANT STANDS! MY HUSBAND ROLLS HIS EYES AS WELL - BUT HE'S QUITE USED TO MY "ONE MAN'S TRASH…." THEORY ON LIFE. GOOD JOB!

 Hahaha…that's funny Joan! I am glad that I have a larger shed now…it houses all of the odds and ends I drag home now and then. My latest favorite is an old washstand that is Steven's great grandmother's. It has been languishing in a storage shed for MANY years. My mother in law offered it to us and I quickly said YES! It took me about three months to convince my husband to bring it home..hahaha

 I have one of those and have wanted to fix it up take paint off and redo I would like to know what did you use to take the paint off, the existing paint. and what kind of paint did you put on it. Mine is not one I found in the trash, but is the first piece of "furniture" I purchased for my very first apartment in 1981 so it has meaning to me. Very cool house good luck with it Norma

 Now dear, you know I always fondly referred to you as my "divergent thinker."
