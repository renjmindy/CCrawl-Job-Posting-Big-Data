 High Demand Job Training 
 High Demand Job Training Program 
 The Texas Workforce Commission has dedicated one million dollars to support collaborations between Workforce Development Boards (Boards) and Economic Development Corporations (EDCs) to provide high-demand occupational job training in local workforce areas. 
 The High Demand Job Training Program is intended to support Boards in partnering with local EDCs that use their local economic development sales taxes for high-demand job training. To achieve that purpose, TWC wants to enable Boards to collaborate with local EDCs and match their local economic development sales tax funds to jointly support the provision of such training. 
 If an EDC would like to collaborate to apply for a  High Demand Job Training Program , contact  Cara DiMattina-Ryan .
