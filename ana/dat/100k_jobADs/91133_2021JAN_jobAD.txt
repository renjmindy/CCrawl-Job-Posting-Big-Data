 Role overview 
 Your Opportunity 
 The Kafka Platform team is seeking an experienced DevOps-focused senior software engineer to join our team. We maintain, grow, scale, and automate New Relicâ€™s Kafka and Zookeeper infrastructure. If you are confident and experienced in working with large distributed data systems, have a particular interest in effective patterns and practices for automating their care and maintenance activities, and have a growth mindset, let chat! This diverse team is currently comprised of a mix of both Software Engineers and Site Reliability Engineers, so if youâ€™re interested in contributing and growing at that intersection, this would be a great role for you! We are also migrating to the cloud, starting with AWS/MSK and eventually supporting a multi-cloud environment. Any experience in cloud operations or development with systems at scale would be a bonus. 
 New Relic's engineering culture emphasizes team autonomy, which means that each team chooses how they do their work and has a say in which projects they work on. It also means that our teams are responsible for their own operational tooling and on-call rotation. We strive to reduce dependencies between teams so that we can work at an efficient velocity without blocking others. 
 What Youâ€™ll Do 
 
 Use your experience with application development to create distributed large scale services that will be used by our client teams. 
 Engage with architects, team leads, and team members to introduce new patterns for using our shared Kafka infrastructure in ways that increase the efficiency and reliability of our shared platform. 
 Use your DevOps savvy to operate a large scale Kafka cluster that is the foundation of New Relic's data pipeline. 
 Maintain and improve the internal Kafka client libraries used by multiple teams at New Relic to add better monitoring and resiliency features. 
 Contribute to our automation framework that provision repeatable infrastructure and clusters, helping us scale to handle rapid growth and expand into the public cloud. 
 
 Your Qualifications 
 Must-have: 
 
 5+years of hands-on experience and proficiency in one or more of these languages: Java, Python, Go, or C. 
 Experience with streaming in general (e.g. spark streaming) and Kafka in particular. 
 Development and support of Kafka integrations, including topics, producers, consumers, and streaming applications (Bonus). 
 Experience with a cloud computing platform such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure. 
 Experience with and passion for the operational automation of distributed systems, such as Apache Kafka or Apache ZooKeeper. 
 Experience writing distributed applications with high availability. 
 Proven communication skills, both written and oral. 
 Experience working in Linux systems. 
 
 Nice-to-have: 
 
 Experience writing a Kubernetes operator. 
 Experience with Configuration and fine-tuning of Kafka for optimal production performance. 
 Familiarity with AWS MSK. 
 Familiarity with the Linux shell and a scripting language such as Python or Ruby. 
 Familiarity with Container Linux, AWS (EC2, S3, etc), and the tools and patterns used to handle repeatable infrastructure at scale (Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible).
