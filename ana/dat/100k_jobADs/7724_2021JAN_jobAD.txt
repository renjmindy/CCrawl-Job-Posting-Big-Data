 Penn National Gaming Opens Casino Career Center 
 __ JT 
 __ September 23, 2014 
 __ Latest Casino and Gambling News ,  World Casino News ,  North America Casino News 
 Penn National Gaming, Inc. (Nasdaq: PENN) (the “Company” or “Penn National Gaming”) announced that its Plainridge Park Casino Career Center opened today and is now accepting applications for 500 new permanent jobs. The Plainridge Park Casino Career Center is located at 416 South Street in Plainville, Massachusetts. 
 “We are excited to start the employment process for Plainridge Park Casino with the opening of our Career Center,” said Eric Schippers, Senior Vice President of Public Affairs for Penn National Gaming. “Plainridge Park Casino is already employing over 400 construction workers, with an additional 600 construction jobs expected before we open our doors next year. Today, we welcome potential employees to visit with our staff and learn about the more than 500 permanent jobs we will be creating in the Commonwealth, of which 90% are planned to be hired from the local area.” 
 The Plainridge Park Casino Career Center will be open Monday–Friday, from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., with expanded hours beginning in 2015. Potential employees can apply for jobs at the Career Center or online by visiting  www.plainridgeparkcasino.com/Careers . Plainridge Park Casino will also host a job information session on October 15. More details on the job information session will be provided in the coming weeks. 
 Penn National Gaming began constructing Plainridge Park Casino in March, following the award of the Category 2 Gaming License by the Massachusetts Gaming Commission on February 28. The facility is more than halfway complete and is expected to open in June 2015. Penn National Gaming is continuing the development of Plainridge Park Casino despite a pending ballot initiative in November to repeal the gaming law. 
 “We are confident that the people of Massachusetts will support the creation of 500 new jobs in Plainville, the 10,000 new permanent jobs the gaming industry will create across the Commonwealth and the thousands of ancillary and construction services jobs created by the industry,” said Schippers. “Plainville, Springfield, and Everett have already voted overwhelmingly to support these economic development projects in their communities, and we hope the citizens of Massachusetts will respect their decisions at the ballot box by voting No on Question 3 in November.” 
 About Plainridge Park Casino 
 Plainridge Park Casino will include a fully integrated 106,000 square foot racing and gaming facility featuring live harness racing and simulcasting with 1,250 slot machines, an upscale casual dining restaurant, the first-ever Doug Flutie Sports Bar, four-venue food court, harness concourse bar, multi-purpose banquet room, entertainment lounge and casino bar, 1,620 structured and surface parking spaces, 26,000 square foot grandstand with box and reserved seats, and 13,000 square foot clubhouse with box seats. 
 About Penn National Gaming 
 Penn National Gaming owns, operates or has ownership interests in gaming and racing facilities with a focus on slot machine entertainment. At June 30, 2014, the Company operated twenty-seven facilities in eighteen jurisdictions, including Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia, and Ontario. At June 30, 2014, in aggregate, Penn National Gaming’s operated facilities featured approximately 30,900 gaming machines, 790 table games and 2,900 hotel rooms.
