 Let's talk about the Winnipeg Blue Bombers' Canadian Mafia getting the job done…popcorn in the bathroom?…a paddywhacking in the woodshed…groupie Glen Suitor gets gooey over Keith Urban…Andrew Harris and the “haters"…and it's time to sign off 
 Monday morning coming down in 3, 2, 1 …and, say, it turned out nice again… 
 Well I'll be damned. The Canadian Mafia got it done. 
 And, yes, I'll confess there were times when I harbored serious doubt that the True North Trinity had what it takes to build a championship cocktail, and I figured one of Mike O'Shea, Kyle Walters or Wade Miller would have been out the door by now. 
 My money was always on O'Shea to be kicked to the curb first, because head coaches tend to get a lot less leash than general managers or CEOs. Some of them, in fact, don't last much longer than a pint of beer in front of Chris Walby. 
 The Canadian Mafia: Mike O'Shea, Wade Miller, Kyle Walters. 
 In Coach Grunge's case, though, at some point in the past six years O'Shea learned to get out of his own way, leaving the gadgetry and gimmickry (read: fake punts, phantom field goals and truly dopey coaching) to others, and the rabble was partying at Portage and Main for the first time in 29 years on Sunday night because of it. 
 The Winnipeg Blue Bombers are rulers of all they survey in Rouge Football, and Coach Grunge's lads didn't just take down the dreaded Hamilton Tabbies in the 107th edition of Grey Cup skirmishing. They turned McMahon Stadium in the Alberta Foothills into a woodshed. They delivered a man-to-boys paddywhacking to an outfit that had better credentials entering the fray, but the Tabbies' 16-3 record and a couple of bucks wouldn't have bought them a cup of coffee at Tim's. 
 Even if it did, they wouldn't have been able to sit and enjoy it, because their lips were too swollen and bruised. 
 Did someone say smash mouth? It was Winnipeg FC 33, Hamilton 12 when the tears of joy began rolling down cheeks, including Richie Hall's, but that 33-12 scoreline looked a lot more like 50-12, and it truly was a made-in-Canada production. 
 Look at the main players. O'Shea…hoser. GM Walters…hoser. CEO Miller…hoser. Then, of course, there was Andrew Harris, the day's most outstanding player…hoser. 
 Good day, eh? Yes, it was. It was a very good day. 
 Random thoughts and observations  while watching the Bombers ragdoll the Tabbies to become Canadian Football League titleholders: 
 Danny Mac 
 Pre-Game:  Nice to see truly good guy Brian Williams on the TSN set, and the veteran broadcaster doesn't go all wishy-washy in his chin-wag with CFL grand poobah Randy Ambrosie. When Commish Randy puts on his happy face and describes the lame market in the Republic of Tranna as “an opportunity,” Williams scoffs and calls it “a disaster.” Atta boy, Brian…Mike Benevides drops by to explain how the Bombers might stop Brandon Banks, and he mentions something about a “kill Speedy B” strategy. “He goes to the bathroom for popcorn (follow him),” he said. Excuse me, but who gets their popcorn in a bathroom?…Fun chin-wag between the TSN panel and Winnipeg FC assistant GM and hall-of-fame quarterback Danny McManus. Milt Stegall notes that Danny Mac always seemed to be in good humor during his playing days, even when tossing four picks in a game. “If someone caught it,” Danny Mac jokes, “I just counted it as a completion.”…I don't know about you, but I'm liking The Beaches. Three guitars, a drum kit, and keyboards. Yup, looks and sounds like a rock band to me. Hope Nicole Kidman's husband, Keith Urban, is as good during the halftime show…Tabbies lose the coin toss. Might be a harbinger. 
 Willie Jefferson 
 First Quarter:  Brandon Alexander picks Hamilton QB Dane Evans' first pass, and the Bombers are geeked up…Andrew Harris head butts Darth Defender, Simoni Lawrence, after a whistle and directly in front of an official, but the zebra keeps his hanky in his pocket. Go figure…Willie Jefferson forces Evans to spill the football and Beastmo Bighill gobbles it up. One play later, Harris skedaddles 15 yards to the house. Bombers 7, Tabbies nada…What's this? Does Speedy B have an owie? Looks like it. Need to keep an eye on that…Lirim Hajrullahu's right leg puts the Tabbies on the board with a three-pointer. Bombers 7, Tabbies 3…Old reliable Justin Medlock's left leg isn't so reliable, and he's wayward on a field goal attempt, but Speedy B doesn't bring it out of the end zone. Strange. Bombers 8, Tabbies 3…Bombers D-line stuffs the Tabbies on a third-and-one…Total dominance by the Bombers on both sides of the line, so why is it only 8-3 for the good guys? 
 Glen Suitor 
 Second Quarter:  Hajrullahu and Medlock exchange FGs. Bombers 11, Tabbies 6…The Bombers defensive dozen, especially the front four, is mauling the Tabbies O-line. This thing should already be a route…Check it out. Chris Streveler is in at QB for Winnipeg FC and he's throwing the ball. Complete to Andrew Harris. Touchdown. Bombers 18, Tabbies 6…I know there's plenty of football left to play, but I'm already declaring a winner. This game is over. The Bombers have everything, the Tabbies nothing. Trust me, it's in the bag…Hey, there's Nicole Kidman's hubby Keith heading inside to warm his hands…Oh dear. One look at Keith Urban and Glen Suitor is swooning in the TSN broadcast booth, comparing country music to football. He tells us there are “twelve chords” in a country music song and 12 players on the Bombers offence. Fabulous insight, Suits…Zach Collaros connects with Rasheed Bailey for an 11-yard gain. “Another hit song for (offensive co-ordinator) Paul LaPolice,” says Suitor. Good grief…Another FG from Medlock. Bombers 21, Tabbies 6…Like I said, it's a done deal…There's Bob Young, the Tabbies bankroll. But don't call him the team owner, he insists he's the team caretaker. In that case, he should grab a broom and sweep up the gawdawful mess his club is leaving on the McMahon Stadium carpet. 
 Halftime:  It's Keith Urban time…My young daughter in the B.C. interior tells me he's a country music superstar, but without a steel guitar or a fiddle, his isn't my kind of country…He does three tunes, none of which sound country. In fact, Nicole's hubby sounds a lot like Barry Gibb and the Bee Gees on his third number…The kids seem to like it, though, and that's all that matters. 
 Keith Urban 
 Third Quarter:  Receiver Darvin Adams takes a direct snap and completes a pass to QB Streveler. The Bombers are rubbing their noses in it now…Another Medlock FG. Bombers 24, Tabbies 6…Bombers stuff the Tabbies on another third-and-one. Someone call a priest and have him go to the Hamilton sideline, STAT!…Hey, look who's joined Suits and Chris Cuthbert in the TSN booth. Why, it's Nicole Kidman's hubby, and Suitor immediate goes into teenybopper/groupie mode. “What's your favorite song?” he gushes. “You set a new standard (in the halftime show), Keith. I am a huge, huge fan.”…Jaelon Acklin hauls in an Evans pass near the sideline, and Suitor instructs the boys in the truck to run a replay. “Take a look at the replay, 'cause Keith Urban wants to know,” he says…It's time for Urban to go home to Australia or Nashville, so Suitor, celebrating his 57th birthday, wraps his left arm around him and says, “I can tell all my buddies Keith Urban sang happy birthday,” he squeals…Hey, it's my 69th birthday on Wednesday. Wonder if Keith will stop by to serenade me. Probably not…I don't know if Suitor asked for an autograph, but I'm pretty sure he had to wipe himself dry after Urban left. 
 Fourth Quarter:  The rest, as they say, is history. The Bombers continue to maul the Tabbies and send Speedy B to the infirmary. He's done for the night. Make the final: Bombers 33, Tabbies 12. 
 Andrew Harris and his trinkets. 
 Postgame:  Richie Hall is wiping tears from his eyes, and I can't say I blame the much maligned man in charge of the Bombers defensive dozen. He lost a brother not so long ago, so emotions are pouring out…Andrew Harris, banished for two regular-season games after lab squints found a PED in his pee, is a bit of an ugly winner. “All the haters out there who talk shit, this is for you,” he snarls at Sara Orlesky of TSN. He says something similar after accepting his most outstanding player/Canadian awards, suggesting “haters” can take his trinkets and shove 'em where there's only darkness. Understandable, I suppose, given what he went through, but ugly nonetheless…O'Shea stands back and allows the longest-serving member of the Bombers, Jake Thomas, to get his paws on the Grey Cup first. And that would explain why Coach Grunge is so popular with his troops….Smilin' Hank Burris informs us that “We didn't see one Bomber player limp off that field.” Tell that to Streveler who, at times, could scarcely walk…The boys in the booth and on the TSN panel repeatedly made reference to Harris' two-game suspension, but I don't recall any of them mentioning it was for a drug bust. Odd…It's all over but the hangovers and the parade…Cuthbert and Suitor sign off, but not before Suits thanks his new heartthrob Keith Urban. 
 And, finally, I 've now witnessed eight Blue Bombers Grey Cup victories,  dating back to QB Jim Van Pelt's 22-point game in 1958, and I covered three of them. This one feels special, and it's a good way to bow out. I'm taking a break from the River City Renegade blog, and it might turn out to be permanent. We'll see. In the meantime, thanks to the 116,000-plus who stopped by for a read, and enjoy the parade.

 Hi Bruce. Thanks. I can agree that I'm getting older, but I'm not sure about the better part. I've had fun, though.

 I always enjoy your prose Patti, and I will miss those observations while you take a knee. Out for three plays seems fair. Hope to see your grade A stuff again real soon.
