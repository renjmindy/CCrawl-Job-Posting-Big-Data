 Taking ownership for the full events calendar 
 Managing and tracking the full events budget for the whole organisation 
 Working with the marketing and communications teams to produce all comms and collateral to promote the events 
 Management of a small events team 
 Developing a stakeholder engagement strategy 
 
 This Events Manager position requires a candidate with the following skills: 
 
 Experienced in the management of both small and large-scale events 
 Proven experience of managing a wide range of events, both corporate and non-corporate 
 Budget management 
 Experience of planning and managing events internationally 
 Excellent and professional communication skills, both written and verbal 
 Outstanding stakeholder management skills 
 The ability to manage a number of projects at any one time
