 Named Again to FlexJobs Top 100 Companies with Remote Jobs 
 __02/07/2017 
 Increasing Value of Remote Workforce 
 Good news never gets old. Especially when it occurs year after year. For the third year in a row, Working Solutions made  FlexJobs Top 100 companies with remote jobs in 2017 —out of more than 47,000 businesses. 
 It is, in fact, the second time Working Solutions made the Top 10—back to back. Our FlexJobs standings are: 
 
 2017 – #7 
 2016 – #9 
 2015 – #13 
 
 We’re certainly going in the right direction—up, with recognition from an industry leader that champions legitimate, work-at-home opportunities. 
 _ Forbes_ quoted FlexJobs CEO Sara Sutton Fell  as saying: “The results of this year’s list are in line with the overall growth trends we’re observing in the flexible job marketplace, with increasingly diverse companies turning to the ‘TRaD’ (or telecommuting, remote, and distributed) model of work as an integrated business practice.”

 When I started Working Solutions more than 20 years ago, TRaD wasn’t even an acronym. The public Internet still was in its infancy. And telecommuting, which Gallup in 2015 reported that 37% of U.S. workers have done, hovered at only 9% in 1995. 
 Fast-forward to 2017. Freed by technology and a mobile mindset, remote workers are on demand and more in demand than ever. Today’s workplace is fluid, fueled by freelance talent. And millennials, who value their flexibility, aren’t bound by cubicles or corner offices. 
 Which brings us back to Fell’s point about the need for an integrated model. One that requires give and take, from workplaces and workers—employees as well as independent contractors. 
 Simple fact: Remote works. Proven, it will only get bigger. The companies that practice it, and the individuals who perform, will prosper. Brave new workplace. Brave new workers. Business cards are optional.
