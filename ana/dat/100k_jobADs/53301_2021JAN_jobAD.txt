 Backend Developer (Python) , London Based 
 Nobody can predict how we will use vehicles in 10 years. Are all vehicles going to be self-driving? Is traffic going to be controlled using a central or distributed system? Are we going to own cars at all? Whatever the future of autonomous vehicles will be, one thing is certain: we will need roads, good, safe and intelligent ones. 
 If you want to be part of a dynamic and award-winning start-up and help shape the future of mobility - join Valerann! We are developing a traffic management solution that is based on a unique vehicle-level data fusion. We ingest streams of data in our cloud environment; we run machine learning algorithms to identify various traffic issues and feed them back in real-time to vehicles and traffic control centres. We have made huge progress, but we need your help to move to the next level. 
 Our London-based team is looking for a talented, experienced and hard-working python developer. Your primary focus will be developing our backend services: API and data pipelines that ingest streams of data (IoT, social media, camera feed and connected vehicles data), run machine learning algorithms, in real-time and in batch and store the data in various databases. 
 A proven experience that we are looking for: 
 
 At least 3 years experience in developing backend code and data pipelines using Python 
 Experience in developing production-ready machine learning code 
 Experience with implementing machine vision pipelines or IoT pipelines, for example, streaming, processing data in real-time and in batch, storing data. 
 A high level of database proficiency, and experience at working with databases such as PostgreSQL, Athena/Hive and stream engines such as Kafka. 
 Experience at developing APIs, for example using Flask or FastAPI. 
 Using software development tools such as AWS/Azure, Docker, Terraform, Github, Jira, Airflow, Grafana. 
 
 You should be 
 
 A person who likes to work in a start-up environment: dealing with uncertainties, working in a small team, and taking initiatives. 
 Someone who enjoys engineering complex systems. 
 Someone who can identify MVP and develop the right product. 
 Someone who is eligible to work in the UK without sponsorship. 
 
 The interview process 
 
 Initial 30 minutes introduction where we will learn more about your professional background and experience. This will also be a good opportunity for you to understand more about the role and our company. 
 One hour technical interview. 
 One hour pair programming task. You and one of our team members will work together to develop a small backend service. 
 Final interview with one of the company founders. 
 All interviews will be held remotely. 
 
 Location: London/Camden (flexible working is an option) 
 *The company is an equal opportunity employer
