 About this project 
 it-programming / web-development 
 USD 100 - 250 
 The MAODV protocol (described at this link:  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-manet-maodv-00)  has already been implemented for the ns-2 simulator (attached files). However, since the ns-3 simulator is not a continuum of ns-2, we need the ns-2 MAODV protocol code to be ported to ns-3. Tests will be required to know if the protocol implemented in ns-3 is in accordance with the RFC and the results of the literature ( https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8515831 ,
