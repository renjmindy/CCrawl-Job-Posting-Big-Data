 If you have decided to take your career to the next level in 2018, here are 5 tips to get you started. 
 1. Take Responsibility For Your Development Needs 
 Training budgets were low in 2017 and this is unlikely to improve much in 2018. It is no longer your organization’s responsibility to manage your career. Your career is your business and you must take control of your personal development. Define your professional identity including your strengths, values and career goals. Identify the knowledge gaps between where you are now and where you want to go and take full responsibility for your learning and development needs. If this process feels overwhelming, invest in a career coach. 
 2. Create A Personal Brand 
 There is a clear correlation between product branding and success. So why would it be any different for your career success? Take control of your branding and position yourself as a thought leader in your field. Building a personal brand will help you build credibility, showcase your skills, distinguish yourself from the competition and connect with a broader yet more targeted audience. Start by giving your resume a facelift and optimizing your use of LinkedIn. You can also consider creating a blog or a website, write articles for industry related publications or pursue public speaking opportunities. 
 3. Embrace Gender Equality 
 Gender equality gained momentum in 2017 and will undoubtedly be one of the main 2018 organizational goals in the UAE. Indeed, the UAE government has urged all companies to improve gender diversity backed up with a new set of laws, a UAE Gender Balance Guide and several forums and events to be held throughout 2018. The issue becomes impossible to ignore and whether you are a man or a woman, embracing gender equality will greatly impact your career success. 
 4. Take Care Of Your Mental & Physical Health 
 Living and working in one the fastest growing countries in the world also comes with higher stress levels, anxiety and poor health habits. This explains the government’s efforts to improve overall happiness with the creation of a ministry of happiness in 2016 and the rise of employee well-being programs within organizations. Unfortunately, the number of early strokes and burnouts is still worrying and way above global average. Your mental and physical health is crucial to your career success and you must take responsibility for your own well-being. Be it a gym membership, meditation or yoga; take a moment to identify the necessary lifestyle corrective actions you want to implement in 2018. 
 5. Sharpen Your Technology skills 
 Regardless of your industry and line of work, technology is the present and the future of our world and it is more than ever crucial to stay up-to-date with the technological trends and innovations within your field. This will not only make your job and your life easier, it will also increase your value to your current or potential employers. Consider taking the time to learn about new technologies as this is an investment that can propel your performance, your efficiency and your value.
