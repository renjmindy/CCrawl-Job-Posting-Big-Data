 Job Well Done! 
 May 30, 2013  by  Nita 
 Congratulations to each and every one involved in the creation of Sentient. We had 2 great audiences for our 2 screenings, many proud parents, and smiling students. Thank you for all of your hard work. Now it is time for thank you notes, file storage, archiving, documentation and rest. 
 There was a lot of still image and video documentation done. Look for an email from Lina with suggestions for how to manage it all. but for starters please upload what you can to the dropbox. You will all want a clean version of the documentation for your portfolios. 
 You are awesome!
