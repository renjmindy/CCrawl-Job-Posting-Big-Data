  Boost Your Career By Learning At Home  
 Kaplan Open Learning UK 
 January 06, 2013 
 Deciding to take the plunge and return to  education  can be difficult. In a time of economic hardship, where any job – no matter how unfulfilling – is seen as a blessing, how are you meant to risk everything for your education? Especially for those of us with families or other dependents to support, the idea of losing income is enough to make us put our own education plans on hold for the good of our household. But there are ways to get round concerns about losing income, or studying and working at the same time. While a full-time university degree might not necessarily be the most financially viable option, there are other ways to develop your education. One of these ways is by  learning at home . Choosing to study from home can be a rewarding experience, and one that enables you to continue with your job as well as improving your education. In many cases, taking part in home learning and choosing from a wide range of courses, whether vocational or otherwise, can increase career and employment prospects quite dramatically. From evening and part time courses, to a bachelor’s degree or other higher education qualification, home learning can adapt to your needs and ensure that no one has to miss out. However, there are some key things to remember before embarking on a home learning course. Many people begin part time or home-led education without fully realizing the impact it can have on their free time and home life. As most home learning courses require you to work independently, unlike a university degree or many other education courses, it’s essential that you understand how much time home learning can take up, and the personal motivation you need to succeed. Adjusting from work to education or vice versa can be quite tricky, and balancing the two can be very tricky indeed. However, there are some simple ways to ensure you are making the most of the opportunities home learning provides. One of the best ways to make the most of a home learning course is to plan in the time where you work on the course very strictly. Creating a workable timetable for yourself, that fits in around your regular employment, other hobbies and family commitments will mean that you’re more likely to stick with your home learning course and make the most of it. Similarly, if you feel your motivation levels are a little low, ensure you invest in a home learning course that has some elements of group tutoring or access to student forums. Talking to fellow students in a similar position as yourself will help you to motivate yourself to do well, as well as ensuring you don’t go stir crazy! Photo Credit:  Shutterstock
