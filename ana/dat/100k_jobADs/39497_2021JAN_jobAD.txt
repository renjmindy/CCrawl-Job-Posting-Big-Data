 Chairman & CEO of Gallup, Jim Clifton, Fears For His Life For Fact Checking U.S. Jobs Data

 Gallup CEO Fears He Might “Suddenly Disappear” for Questioning U.S. Jobs Data 
 By  Pam Martens and Russ Martens : February 5, 2015 
 CNBC video :  http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000352013 
Years of unending news stories on U.S. government programs of  surveillance ,  rendition  and  torture  have apparently chilled the speech of even top business executives in the United States. 
Yesterday, Jim Clifton, the Chairman and CEO of Gallup, an iconic U.S. company dating back to 1935, told CNBC that he was worried he might “suddenly disappear” and not make it home that evening if he disputed the accuracy of what the U.S. government is reporting as unemployed Americans.The  CNBC interview  came one day after Clifton had penned a gutsy opinion piece on Gallup’s web site, defiantly calling the government’s 5.6 percent unemployment figure “The Big Lie” in the article’s headline. His appearance on CNBC was apparently to walk back the “lie” part of the title and reframe the jobs data as just hopelessly deceptive. 
 Clifton stated the following on CNBC: 
 “I think that the number that comes out of BLS [Bureau of Labor Statistics] and the Department of Labor is very, very accurate. I need to make that very, very clear so that I don’t suddenly disappear. I need to make it home tonight.” 
 After getting that out of the way, Clifton went on to eviscerate the legitimacy of the cheerful spin given to the unemployment data, telling CNBC viewers that the percent of full time jobs in this country as a percent of the adult population “is the worst it’s been in 30 years.” 
 Clifton drilled down further in his on line opinion piece, writing as follows: 
 “Right now, we’re hearing much celebrating from the media, the White House and Wall Street about how unemployment is ‘down’ to 5.6%. The cheerleading for this number is deafening. The media loves a comeback story, the White House wants to score political points and Wall Street would like you to stay in the market. 
 “None of them will tell you this: If you, a family member or anyone is unemployed and has subsequently given up on finding a job — if you are so hopelessly out of work that you’ve stopped looking over the past four weeks — the Department of Labor doesn’t count you as unemployed. That’s right. While you are as unemployed as one can possibly be, and tragically may never find work again, you are  not  counted in the figure we see relentlessly in the news — currently 5.6%. Right now, as many as 30 million Americans are either out of work or severely underemployed. Trust me, the vast majority of them aren’t throwing parties to toast ‘falling’ unemployment. 
 “There’s another reason why the official rate is misleading. Say you’re an out-of-work engineer or healthcare worker or construction worker or retail manager: If you perform a minimum of one hour of work in a week and are paid at least $20 — maybe someone pays you to mow their lawn — you’re not officially counted as unemployed in the much-reported 5.6%. Few Americans know this. 
 “Yet another figure of importance that doesn’t get much press: those working part time but wanting full-time work. If you have a degree in chemistry or math and are working 10 hours part time because it is all you can find — in other words, you are severely underemployed — the government doesn’t count you in the 5.6%. Few Americans know this.” (Read the full article  here .) 
 
 Another bold truth teller when it comes to the jobs data is Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, the former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury and former Associate Editor of the Wall Street Journal.  For years  Roberts has written about the lack of attention to the measurement known as U6 – which covers the unemployed, underemployed and those who are not looking but want a job. That figure stood at 11.2 percent in December of last year, exactly double the official unemployment rate known at U3. 
 The fact that hourly earnings are not improving with the improvement in the official unemployment rate and that the labor force participation rate of working age men (ages 25 to 54) now stands at the lowest level since the BLS started keeping records more than 60 years ago adds further fodder to “The Big Lie” theory.

 G20 and BRICS will lead the Push for De-Dollarization 
 
 Ten years ago, the world’s reserves consisted to about 90 percent of dollar denominated securities. Today that figure has shrunk to 60 percent, the economist said. 
 Koenig believes Washington is afraid of losing the dollar’s monopoly on the global stage, and is trying to destabilize the situation in the BRICS countries. For example, by slandering the government of Dilma Rousseff in Brazil for corruption and high debt, or depreciating the Russian ruble by fraud and currency manipulations. 
 “Today, though steadily declining, most trading is still denominated in dollars and has to transit through a US bank and the BIS clearing system,” he said. “Under the FED-BIS-WS banking system currencies and gold are subject to exchange rate and interest manipulations”. 
 The potential of BRICS is promising indeed, as the members account for almost 30 percent of world GDP and about 45 percent of the global population. 
 
 Perhaps the U.S. and the 4 partners will make token opposition and cause some deaths but they or elements within their policy making apparatus support the de-dollarization agenda… 
More puzzle pieces to keep in mind as the plan for a new monetary system of multipolarity aka "currency zones" to replace the current unipolar U.S. Dollar hegemony. 
 1.  Peter Koenig is a former economist and water resource specialist for the World Bank. He is portrayed by mass media as a "Progressive"… 
He self proclaims, on his blog, that "his central theme for almost 30 years I’ve compiled a selection of material here on money. What you'll read was a "temporary posting" in 2006 and though the financial landscape has been through enormous changes since then the content here is virtually unchanged." 
 2.  24 Nov 2014 RT news ran a report titled: 
 ‘BRICS system’ – healthy alternative to ‘defunct dollar system’  featuring Peter Koenig commentary. 
The BRICS Bank marks a major step to de-dollarization, and a new monetary system. It should replace the Western-dominated “predatory casino scheme” that has contributed to world wars and “economic terrorism,” says former World Bank economist Peter Koenig. 
 “A ‘BRICS system’ would offer a healthy alternative to the highly indebted and defunct dollar system, where money is printed at will,” Koenig said in an interview with Asam Ismi of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. 
 A 'BRICS system' should be based on a new currency, which Koenig called 'Bricso.' 
Read Full Report:  http://rt.com/business/208367-brics-new-monetary-system/ 
 3.  Are we seeing a faction calling for something other than the SDR? 
Or is this a disguised attempt to further the SDR cause under a different name? 
That RT news report was a repeat of past Koenig reports posted on other sites about a currency known as the "Bricso": 
 http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-bricso-vs-the-us-dollar-what-will-happen-to-the-global-economy-if-brics-announce-launch-of-new-currency/5353714 
(Global Research, October 09, 2013  Voice of Russia  ) 
“These measures will certainly have an impact on the world economy. To predict exactly what will happen is impossible. Time will tell. But, yes, there will be some collateral damage, especially in those countries that have been relying heavily on the US dollar, on trading with the United States. But it will also affect us, the BRICS. A large proportion of our dollar denominated reserves will be wiped out, as the dollar will undoubtedly plummet – but again, it is difficult to speculate at this time to what extent it will lose its value.” … 
“And, Sir, yours too – and that of other countries that have large amounts of US Treasury bonds in their central banks. But, ladies and gentlemen, I predict that this is only a short-lived loss, as we will quickly recover the value of the lost dollars through a stronger and more stable Bricso. To be precise, the artificial and highly inflated value of the US dollar – which in fact, has for decades had no real backing, other than the world’s belief in America’s strength. But by now, most of the world realizes that the only strength that Washington can stand for is brute military force. Its economy depends on wars and conflicts around the world. The US economy is indeed based on destruction – not construction. Accounting for all associated industries and services, way more than 50% of the US GDP consists of the American military industrial and security complex. The rest is consumption of goods made abroad, many of them in the BRICS countries, and of values of services blown out of proportion.”
