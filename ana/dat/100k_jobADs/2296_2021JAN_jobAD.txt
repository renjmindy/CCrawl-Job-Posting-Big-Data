 My fall 2015 live-event schedule is posted.  I'll be doing several appearances talking about working at home in a variety of capacities. You can check my schedule on the  Events  page. 
 Along with managing Work-At-Home Success and several other blogs, I also write for other sites. Much of the content is required to be exclusive to the site, which means I can't reprint it here. But it's still information you might find helpful. Here are links to my content found on other sites:

 Entrepreneur  - Articles related to business and success. 
 WAHM.com  - Articles on telecommuting, home business, marketing, parenting and adoption
