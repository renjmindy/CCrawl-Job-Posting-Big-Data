 Hello everyone! Welcome to another beautiful Wednesday morning with LIFE WORK BALANCES, the podcast for, by, and about student affairs professionals! 
 Today I had the opportunity to sit down with Diana (Di) Wong, who works as an Employment and Training Advisor for the  San Diego Metro Career Center . I actually met Di over  Twitter , and after we had tweeted back and forth for a while I asked her to be interviewed, and we had a great time talking about food, twitter, community building, and  Tahitian  &  Hula  Dancing. We also had a very interesting diversion into the differences in working within a for profit university from those in a not-for-profit system, and the different ways in which students can be impacted by those systems. We probably would have talked for hours and hours, but we had to stop since a mutual friend was waiting very patiently for us to finish so that we could have dinner together. 
 Make sure to check out Di's twitter hashtag  #NASPAEATS  for all sorts of information about finding good food at NASPA conferences.
