 Overview 
 Automattic, the company behind WordPress.com, Jetpack, and WooCommerce, is looking for an exceptional Director of Shipping Product and Engineering to join WooCommerceâ€™s Shipping group. 
 WooCommerce is an open-source, completely customizable ecommerce platform for businesses worldwide. We are passionate about democratizing commerce and allowing businesses of all sizes, who sell anywhere, to ship anywhere. We go beyond the confines of traditional ecommerce solutions. Weâ€™re building a platform that not only gives shoppers a great experience, but also helps businesses grow, and which is only limited by a merchantâ€™s own imagination. 
 As Director of Carrier Partnerships, you will be responsible for our carrier relationships; primarily for our flagship service WooCommerce Shipping. Youâ€™ll negotiate agreements, monitor performance, and work with engineering, product, and marketing to develop and lead our joint offering; and ensure the long-term success of carrier partnerships at WooCommerce.

 Use your domain expertise, skills and experience in shipping and fulfilment to contribute to our vision, and deliver and achieve our goals.

 Expand our carrier portfolio by identifying and negotiating agreements with new carrier partners. 
 Continuously advocate WooCommerce with partner carriers to generate new mutually beneficial opportunities: marketing campaigns, products/offering enhancements, revenue sharing programs. 
 Coordinate relationships and projects between carriers and WooCommerce. That can include the development of integration (and their certification), carrier launches, joint promotional campaigns, customer service processes. 
 Be our carrier subject matter authority for our product and engineering teams to proactively help design, plan, develop, and implement new carrier product offerings. 
 Design processes to ensure timely and accurate reporting of key results and track the progress of our carrier partnerships. Monitor the reconciliation of billing and financial agreements with carriers. 
 
 This position might be a good fit if you: 
 
 Have demonstrated experience in negotiating, building and maintaining business or product partnerships with shipping carriers or the logistics industry. 
 Deep knowledge of the logistics ecosystem and sound knowledge of ecommerce. 
 Strong analytical skills, including the ability to model business opportunities and assess trade-offs.

 Highly self-motivated and able to work with significant autonomy. 
 A passion for open source technology and an understanding of API integrations, CMS, SaaS, and hosting environments preferred.
