 I have more than a year experience as a Caregiver in 2 Home Care Facility in the US. 
 I believe this is my edge compared to the rest of the applicants. 
 I have very good communication skills (in English). In fact I’m a Trainer for one of the leading Call Centers here in the Philippines. 
 If the job is still open, please contact me via email or you can call me at the numbers I indicated below. 
 Thanks!
