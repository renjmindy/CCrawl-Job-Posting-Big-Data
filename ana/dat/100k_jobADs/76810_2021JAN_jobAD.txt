 Acquire, Measure and Convert more customers from Facebook, Google and LinkedIn Driftrock was founded in 2014 with the goal to make marketing better. Thereâ€™s no excuse for being chased around the internet by images of products youâ€™ve already bought. We believe marketing should be as compelling as content from your friends. This is only possible with through the smarter use of data. People data can be used to both protect privacy, and deliver relevant, useful content that people actually want to see. When you do this, brands also benefit from better results. We work with awesome clients like BMW, Heineken and Honda, and are proud to be official marketing partners of Facebook, Google and LinkedIn. Weâ€™re a team of passionate, friendly, driven people who work hard, but also believe that you can do that whilst still enjoying life! We have a balanced, flexible culture where we have fun and achieve big things for the company and our awesome clients.
