 __ Adam Morgan

 __ Latest Casino and Gambling News ,  The Players Lounge ,  Online Gambling News ,  Mergers, Acquisitions & Partnerships ,  Italy 
 Online casino and sportsbook software innovator  NYX Gaming Group Limited  has announced that it has begun offering its NYX Open Gaming System (OGS) platform to OIA Services Limited and the Italian operator’s brands at Betaland and Enjoybet. 
 Las Vegas-headquartered NYX Gaming Group Limited  declared  that the integration means that Betaland has ‘significantly expanded its offering’ with its players now able to enjoy a range of new titles including the DoublePlay SuperBet and Gorilla Go Wild  video slots  as well as their recently-launched compatriot, Glorious Empire. 
 NYX Gaming Group further stated that the NYX OGS integration was made possible by its Rome-based Game360 studio team and follows on from similar deals in Italy with operators including  Unibet  and  GoldBet . 
 Andrea Guzzon, General Manager for Game360, proclaimed that Betaland now features a ‘comprehensive product offering’ of its own and best-in-breed third-party titles that is ‘sure to attract new and existing customers’. 
 “NYX Gaming Group [Limited] already has a strong presence in Italy and we’re delighted to expand this even further by partnering with Betaland,” said Guzzon. 
 Michele Sprovieri, General Manager for Betaland, explained that the NYX OGS platform integration will allow his site to ‘significantly expand’ its offering in order to provide players with ‘even more high-quality content’. 
 “NYX [Gaming Group Limited’s] in-house game studios have an excellent reputation for producing entertaining games [that are] rich with features and I’m sure they will prove to be a hit with our customer base,” said Sprovieri.
