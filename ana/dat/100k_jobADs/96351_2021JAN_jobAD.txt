  3 LinkedIn Strategies For Escaping Your Crummy Job  
 Ryan Niessen 
 October 31, 2016 
 Let's be honest with each other. The reason you're updating your LinkedIn profile is because you're  sick  of your job.  Related: How LinkedIn Endorsements Can Improve Your Job Search Efforts  You're somewhere between “I need to get the ____ out of here" and “I'm starting to consider other options." We've all been there. But here's the common problem: We want out so badly that we'll update as much as we can as quickly as we can - and then quickly start researching and applying for other jobs. The pain, anger, frustration… whatever you want to call it...  drives us . And it causes us to make less-than-optimal decisions. That's ok though... because the first step to  earning a higher income and being happier at work  is realizing that a change needs to be made. And you're the only person who can do it. 
 
 Here's How To Escape Your Crummy Job 
 First, take a breath. Trust that  you're on your way to something better.  Next, realize that it's smarter to take the time and do a  great job  of updating your profile now than it is to do a mediocre job and get your name out there quicker. You don't want your next job to be as bad - or even just a little better than your current position. 
 Utilize These 3 Powerful LinkedIn Strategies 
 You want to get the  best  job possible, as quickly as possible. Here's how to optimize your LinkedIn profile to do that: 
 1. Use Critical Keywords 
 These are terms that accurately describe your skills and the job title you're seeking. Think of it this way: If a potential employer were to read your LinkedIn profile after you applied for a job, what words would they be looking for to  best  suit the position? Also, what words would a recruiter search for if they were trying to find someone for the position you're seeking? By including these critical keywords throughout your LinkedIn profile, you will increase your chances of getting an interview. Plus, they'll help you get found by recruiters. Dream job, here you come. 
 2. Use A Headline That Sells 
 What looks better to you? “CEO & Managing Director." Or... “CEO & Managing Director – Building High Performing Sales Teams that Align With Corporate Values." It's  obvious . The 2nd headline is better, by far. Simply model your headline after this structure, and include keywords you want to be found for. This simple change will significantly impact your ability to get noticed. 
 3. Get Credible Recommendations 
 It's a truth of human nature. We believe  credible  people's opinions about other people. It's why you see so many advertisements with celebrities or doctors. In the public's eye, they're credible. And in your future employers eye - your past employers, co-workers, teachers, mentors, and even mentees can provide valuable information about your skills, experience, and attitude. So, ask for some recommendations touching on these points from credible people in your network. They'll do wonders for helping you get the job that will make you the happiest and provide the highest income possible. And if you want a little extra help with finding and getting your next job, check out my free video here. It contains three practical job seeking tips I learned from my mentor that helped me get my dream job years ago.  This post was originally published at an earlier date.
