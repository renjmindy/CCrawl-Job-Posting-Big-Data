 XtraLearn is an Education Company based in Ontario, Canada that offers In-Home Tutoring services. 
 A lot of Students are not experiencing success in school, and our Mission is to make the process of learning a better experience, one Student at a time. 
 We know our Company is only as good as our Tutors. So, we take great care of our Tutors. The positions are competitive to obtain, but the work is fun if you are passionate about Tutoring, and financially rewarding if you are hard working. 
 Many of our Students are referrals from previous Students and their families - we think this speaks volumes about how we do things. 
 And because of how we do things, we have lots of work available, many with immediate start dates. 
 We are looking for independent contractor Tutors in all subjects, with Math, Science, Physics, Chemistry, English and French being the subjects with the greatest demand from our students. 
 Get back to us and if you are what we are looking for, we will place you in our Tutor Database immediately. 
 Tutors meet Students whenever is mutually convenient for the Student's family and the Tutor. This could be during weekday mornings, weekday evenings or on weekends. It depends when you want to work. Our Tutors find it extremely flexible. 
 If you are an experienced Tutor who can travel to Students' homes in the Greater Toronto Area and can tutor them in Elementary school, High school or University courses, we look forward to hearing from you.
