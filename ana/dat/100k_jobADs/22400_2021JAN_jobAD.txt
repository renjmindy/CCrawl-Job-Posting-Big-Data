 With our easy to use app you can have all your favourite snacks, drinks and essentials delivered to your door faster than you can walk to the local shop! Phenomenal growth over the last 6 months means we are now live in 4 cities and are rapidly expanding the team to drive growth and optimisation. Whilst the convenience industry might not be the sexiest, it's certainly got size on its side. With a total addressable market in the billions, there is huge scope for disruption and we're on a mission to make convenience far more convenient that it has ever been before. 
 Y Combinator, based out in Silicon Valley, has accelerated the likes of AirBnB, Stripe, Coinbase, Dropbox, Instacart and DoorDash. We're so hyped to be part of this year's cohort and have ambitious growth plans. We plan to be their next unicorn!
