 Ergonomic Design of Jobs 
 Definition - What does Ergonomic Design of Jobs mean? 
 The ergonomic design of jobs refers to a workplace design model in tandem with the physical demands of a position with the aim of facilitating job performance standards, in turn, maximizing productivity. A practical ergonomic design of jobs targets ergonomic hazards that generally cover three archetypal elements, including objects, environments, and systems, all of which contribute to the infrastructure of an ergonomically-sound layout.

 WorkplaceTesting explains Ergonomic Design of Jobs 
 Ergonomic hazards can pose health risks to a workforce where job requirements on daily tasks involve awkward postures, repetitive movements, and the use of defective tools and machinery. A detailed ergonomic design of jobs operates on the premise of moderating physical demands around human efficiency in line with ergonomic-proof variables such as a clean workspace, modified workstations, and adaptable equipment. 
 Depending on the industry, poor ergonomics makes individuals susceptible to episodes of chronic fatigue, muscle strains, among various musculoskeletal stresses on the body that often translate to an employee's capability to meet company standards. The coordination between employers and an ergonomics professional can help canvass employees with immediate feedback, which often dovetails with innovative solutions to improve ergonomic conditions inside the workplace. A comprehensive survey of the physical, physiological, and psychological demands of any job position correlates with the overall functionality of a workplace environment leveraging the quantity of output by the employer. Hence, case report studies indicate that drawing on employee insight for workplace design formats can help bolster morale and productivity, thus minimizing or preventing absenteeism and the incidence rate for musculoskeletal injuries (MSI). 
 The ergonomic design of jobs continues to evolve in response to current workplace design trends that help modulate a comfortable, efficient workforce against the physical demands underlying any job position.
