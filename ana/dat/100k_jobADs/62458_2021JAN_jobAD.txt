  10 Ways To Make Sure You Won't Get The Job  
 J.T. O'Donnell 
 May 21, 2013 
 Want to make sure  you won't get the job ? Of course not. You want to do everything you can to get the offer. However, some people don't completely grasp this concept. The following are 10 true stories. These have all happened to me or my colleagues over the years as hiring managers. I know the  job search process  can be hard to maneuver. Add the fact there's a whole set of "new rules" you need to follow to get employers to even want to hire you and a job seeker can feel pretty overwhelmed. That being said, some things are just common sense. For example, I wouldn't suggest being any of these: 
 
 1. Underdressed 
 Candidate came to the interview for a professional job in a suit and dress shoes - but with no shoelaces or socks. AND THEN, proceeded to sit with his leg across his knee, tapping his foot, drawing attention to his lack of proper attire. 
 2. Overly Honest 
 When asked what the person's greatest weakness was, she replied, "I hate getting up early and tend to be late to work a lot." 
 3. Greedy 
 When I asked if the candidate had any questions, he said, "Ya. How long will it take until I get a raise?" 
 4. Not Being A Team Player 
 When I asked for references, the candidate said, "You can't call anyone from my old company because I hate them all and they probably wouldn't say nice things about me." 
 5. Ignorant Of Your Professional Persona 
 When I called to schedule an interview, the recorded message was playing "Funky Cold Medina" and had people making noises in the background. (Do I need to explain more?) 
 6. Unmotivated 
 When I e-mailed the candidate about scheduling an interview, she e-mailed back, "Now's not a good time for me, can I call you in two weeks?" 
 7. Impatient 
 After the  interview , the candidate called and left me five voice mail messages and sent me an e-mail everyday saying he was just "checking in" to see if I'd made a decision. He did this in spite of the fact I told him, "Don't call us, we'll call you." 
 8. Insincere 
 After the interview, I contacted a person in our company who the candidate said would be a reference for her. The employee said, "I should tell you she doesn't really want the job and is planning to quit if she gets accepted to grad school." 
 9. Unprepared 
 When I asked the candidate what he liked studying the most as a Finance major he said, "I liked the financial stuff." 
 10. Desperate 
 When I asked why she wanted the job, she said, "Because nobody else will hire me."
