 job hunting 
 So…. how many strikes does it take before you're out of the job hunting game?  sigh  No callback  again . Excuse me while I go cry now.

 "work" ,  job hunting ,  not a workoholic 
 I tolerated my way through work today. Having John to get up with me was a real bonus in making me actually drag my sorry ass out of bed to get to the bus this am too. Without him, I'd ahve merely rolled over and gone back to sleep. 
 I am currently being creative with cover letters. By creative I mean 'waxing professional' rather than fabricating interesting details about my work history. Not that I haven't toyed with the idea of "spiffing" things up on my resume little bit. I think it would go a little like this: 
 Previous experience: 
 2001-2003:  Dog trainer at Big Top Animal Tamers Inc  (helped train circus dogs for clown acts that involved slapstick comedy) 
 2004:  Straight jacket tester at Twistntie Corp.  (responsible for testing new products for efficiency and comfort in lifelike surroundings for maximum accuracy) 
 2004-2005:  Quality assurance at OCD Publishing  (duties included: making sure the books smelled  just right  and that all the pages lined up.) 
 You think anyone'd hire me? 
 Mom just called to tell me to turn to KCTS on TV to see the cutest little three-year-old play violin with an entire symphony. Part of me is melting just like she is because he's adorable, but the other part of me is a little sad that such a tiny little guy is subjected to the scrutiny of the masses - and in some cases the laughter of. I'm pretty sure he has no idea what's going on. Poor little tyke. 
 Seeing something like that makes me marvel at all the things we've  learned  in a lifetime - from how to communicate and use the toilet to programming and building things. It's a little astonishing. Esp to think that we can always learn  more . 
 Oh yeah, and I stumbled across  this  which I think is so cool… I almost want to submit one myself. But I don't know what I'd write on it! 
 Sigh… I've had a scene stuck, half-formed, in my head for the last couple of days, but I can't seem to make it work on paper. It's a little annoying to say the least, especially since I can  see  it. I shall try again perhaps before I drag my sorry ass to bed. 
 Two down, three to go until my next day off.
