 CV’s Have Changed Since You Last Looked For A Job. Here's How. 
 11/3/2016

 CV's have changed since you last looked for a job. Trust us. 
 These days you won't get onto the interview short-list by simply listing your basic job functions. Employers are not interested in your responsibilities, what you do from day to day.  Employers want to know the value that you are bringing to the table.  They want to know your successes, how you contribute to the organisation, how you show initiative, what makes you different from other candidates, and above all, how will you will meet their needs. That's what they want to see. 
 ​So how do you go about showcasing your value? 
 It all comes down to accomplishments. Accomplishments are currency when it comes to CV's. The more you have, and the more applicable they are to the job you want, the greater your perceived worth. And you can leverage your accomplishments for job-search success at all stages of the process: CV, cover letter, interview and offer negotiations. 
 ​So before you even begin to think about writing your CV, here's what to do: 
 1. Identify what your target employer needs 
 From the job posting, analyse the skills and experience your target employer is looking for. Also go to LinkedIn to find profiles of employees at your target company or within your target career. Study their skills and accomplishments. Can you see a high representation of certain skills? Use this research to define the "in demand" skills and experience for your target job. 
 2. List your accomplishments 
 Now start thinking about your workplace successes.  How do your accomplishments meet the needs of your target employer?  Take the time to list your former employers and for each one, write down the results you delivered that are most relevant. 
 If you are finding it tricky to pinpoint your accomplishments, here are some prompts to help you brainstorm all those terrific things you have done: 
 
 How did you leave your employers better off than before you worked for them? 
 What did you do to set yourself apart? How did you do the job better than anyone else did or than anyone else could have done? 
 How did you take the initiative? How did you go above and beyond what was asked of you in your job description? 
 What are you most proud of in each job? 
 
 Once you have finished drawing up your list, look over each accomplishment and ask yourself, "so what?" Does the item you've listed truly characterise your abilities and your potential for contributing to your the next employer's success? 
 Top Tip: To make updating your CV quicker and easier the next time you are looking for a new gig, start keeping track of your accomplishments the minute you start a new job. Keep a log in a little notebook, or on index cards, in a computer database, or on your smart phone or other device. 
 3. Communicate your accomplishments in a compelling way 
 You have defined the employer's requirements and your accomplishments relative to those requirements. The next step is to transform those facts into a compelling story that communicates your value. 
 While crafting your story, keep the following in mind: 
 
 Leverage your opening profile section to communicate your best accomplishments, and the ones that most closely match the requirements shown in the employer's job posting. 
 Front-load your accomplishments and then describe how they were achieved. Numbers speak for themselves so quantify whenever possible. Examples include: Increased sales by 30 percent over the previous year; Supervised staff of 10; Served a customer base of 150, the largest in the customer-service team. 
 Make sure your message is simple and clear, as well as enticing enough to keep the reader hooked to the very end. 
 Your CV should differentiate you from other candidates - it is okay to show some personality.
