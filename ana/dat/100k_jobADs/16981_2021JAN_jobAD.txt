 Roberto Fajardo Solution Architect, EMEA Hub 
 To me, working at Backbase is all about freedom - the freedom to explore, to innovate, to create. It's about personal and professional flexibility to try new things and meet new people. 
 Brad Miller Business Analyst, US Hub 
 Working at Backbase keeps me motivated all the time in learning new things in the mobile world. The architecture of the projects, the components, the way the widgets are built, everything excites me. 
 Mahesh Venkat Senior Android Engineer, US Hub 
 The migration of AIB from CXP5 to CX6 has been a good challenge. The knowledge was with people, not in documents. So we had to chase and collaborate with different people and often figure things out ourselves. On the other hand, we had pressure from the client, and the deadline was tight. It made me feel alive! 
 Isuert Mjalti Frontend Engineer, EMEA Hub 
 Working in Backbase gave me the right balance between work and life, customization and out-of-the-box, specific and re-usable solutions, easy and tough clients. It is from this mix that I get inspiration for my daily activities. 
 Raffaele Briganti Senior Solution Architect, EMEA Hub 
 The Backbase community of individuals is a tireless, driven group that, simply put, gets things done. 
 
 Marc Corbett Senior UX Designer, US Hub 
 I get to do way more than sit behind the computer and code. My work also includes going onsite to clients, presenting and explaining the benefits of our product, working with developers from all over the world. 
 Gerardo Cauich Lemus Backend Engineer, EMEA Hub
