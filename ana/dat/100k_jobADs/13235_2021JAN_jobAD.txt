 Great quotes about the New York State of Mind: 
 "I believe in New Yorkers. Whether they’ve ever questioned the dream in which they live, I wouldn’t know, because I won’t ever dare ask that question." - Dylan Thomas 
 "Give me such shows — give me the streets of Manhattan!" - Walt Whitman 
 "One belongs to New York instantly, one belongs to it as much in five minutes as in five years." -Tom Wolfe 
 "I love New York City. The reason I live in New York City is because it’s the loudest city on the planet Earth. It’s so loud I never have to listen to any of the shit that’s going on in my own head. It’s really loud. They literally have guys come with jackhammers and they drill the streets and just leave cones in front of your apartment; you don’t even know why. Garbage men come; they don’t pick up the garbage, they just bang the cans together." - Lewis Black 
 "My advice for aspiring writers is go to New York. And if you can’t go to New York, go to the place that represents New York to you, where the standards for writing are high, there are other people who share your dreams, and where you can talk, talk, talk about your interests. Writing books begins in talking about it, like most human projects, and in being close to those who have already done what you propose to do." **- **Walter Kirn

 How to Defeat Fear 
 Posted on  August 15, 2013  by  Anna Goldstein 
   
 "Once there was a young warrior. Her teacher told her that she had to do battle with fear. She didn’t want to do that. It seemed too aggressive; it was scary; it seemed unfriendly. But the teacher said she had to do it and gave instructions for the battle. 
 The day arrived. The student warrior stood on one side, and fear stood on the other. The warrior was feeling very small, and fear was looking big and wrathful. The young warrior roused herself and went toward fear, prostrated three times, and asked, “May I have permission to go into battle with you?” 
 Fear said, “Thank you for showing me so much respect that you ask permission.” 
 Then the young warrior said, “How can I defeat you?” 
 Fear replied, “My weapons are that I talk fast, and I get very close to your face. Then you get completely unnerved, and you do whatever I say. If you don’t do what I tell you, I have no power. You can listen to me, and you can have respect for me. You can even be convinced by me. But if you don’t do what I say, I have no power.” 
 In that way, the student warrior learned how to defeat fear."

 How to Create Lasting Happiness {Resource 
 Posted on  June 10, 2013  by  Anna Goldstein 
   
 |  |  |  | 
 Over the past year, I've been contemplating a lot about one thing. Happiness. And not just any ordinary version of the word:  Lasting  __ happiness   . 
 What is lasting happiness? How do we achieve it? If the reason behind everything we do is to be happy, then what are we doing wrong? 
 We are looking for happiness in all the wrong places: our jobs, our relationships, etc. - things outside or ourselves to fulfill an inner sense of lack. Projecting happiness onto things outside of us can often lead us to disappointment, unfulfilled expectations and powerlessness. 
 In some cases, you might be aware that even when you landed the perfect job, you still were not happy. 
 Why is this? What's the solution? 
 Often, what prevents us from happiness is our negative thoughts. But, with the practice of meditation, you can learn to let go of what holds you back from being your authentically empowered self! 
 Many of us are becoming more and more conscious beings. A lot of my clients have been asking me about meditation classes and I want to share this resource with you. 
 If you are in the NYC area, I encourage you to attend a meditation class. 
 Check out these classes  : Click Here 
 If you don't live in the NYC area, google "meditation classes + (your area)." 
 I attend weekly meditation classes in Williamsburg, Brooklyn (where I live). It has given me many additional tools to manage my life better and learn to be happier. From this place of inner happiness my relationships have improved, my business has doubled and overall I am experiencing a greater quality of life. 
 In addition to classes, the teacher, Geshe Kelsang, has made an eBook available for f.ree download: Click Here  **** 
 Here's a really powerful quote from the eBook: 
 _" In recent years our knowledge of _ modern technology has increased considerably   , and as a result we have witnessed remarkable material progress, but there has not been a corresponding increase in human   happiness   .  **  There is no less suffering in the world today and there are no fewer problems **  . It could even be said that there are now more problems and greater dangers than ever before.  **  This shows that the cause of ** **  happiness ** **  and the solution to our problems do not lie in knowledge of material things. **  Happiness  _and suffering are states of mind, and so their main causes cannot be found outside of the mind. If we want to be truly happy and free from suffering, we must learn how to control our mind. " _ 
 Yes, that's right, it's in your mind. And guess who has the power to change your mind? YOU. 
 I spend 10 minutes meditating a day. I set my alarm on my iPhone and sit in my room on the floor; just 10 little minutes tuning into my breath. I invite you to do the same. Every time a thought arises, let it go and bring your attention back to your breath. Make this your daily practice. 
 My friends and family have noticed a greater sense of peace in me and I wish for you the same. Meditation combined with training our minds are methods that are scientifically proven to createlasting happiness. 
 Don't forget to download your free eBook: **** Click Here  **** 
 I highly encourage you to use these valuable resources to improve your mind. After all, when you understand your own mind and are able to let go of limiting thoughts, you will be more effective in all areas of your life.
