 Workable includes integrations with  hundreds of job boards  for easy advertising. Post to Indeed for free simply by creating a job in Workable and clicking the Publish button. 
 You can also purchase sponsored job posts on Indeed (and many other job boards). A sponsored post is helpful for increasing the visibility on your post and attracting more candidates. 
 To purchase Indeed sponsored posts you’ll need to perform a one-time setup process to connect Indeed and Workable. 
 
 Click your profile icon in the upper right, click on 'Settings' and navigate to  Integrations 
 Locate  Indeed  in the list of  Job board  integrations and click on it 
 Enter your “advertiser email” from Indeed, which is the one associated with your Indeed account (you need to already have or create one for your company) 
 Enter your contact phone number if needed, as this will be used to contact you if there is an issue with your sponsored post 
 Click  Update Settings 
 
 After the setup process is complete you can purchase Indeed sponsored posts for any of your jobs. 
 
 
 Click on the  Find Candidates  button on the jobs dashboard 
 
 
 Click on  Premium Job Boards 
 
 
 Locate Indeed, choose a ‘ pay per click ’ promotional option and follow the steps that appear
