 Former Scranton Police Chief Loses Job And Lawsuit For Insensitive Remarks 
 Some days you have to wonder how certain people attain the positions they have and what they are using for gray matter. 
 The former  Scranton  Police Chief has resigned after being suspended and ordered to take sensitivity training for calling two female police officers "overtime whores". Common sense would dictate using the word whore when referring to any female is a big old red button you should not push. However, Chief David Elliot did not seem to have the wherewithal to think that phrase would be offensive. Even the city's police union was calling for this guys ouster! 
 Now the City of Scranton has lost a lawsuit (that will cost money) and they are already under Act 47 for being financially distressed. Hmmmm, that was a shrewd business move if ever I saw one. 
 Another lawsuit is pending against the Scranton Police Department from a female officer was discriminated against for gender and age. She was called "granny" by her supervisor. Again, do people not understand what can and cannot be said in the workplace??? 
 Mr. Elliot is taking his formidable business acumen and entering the private sector.
