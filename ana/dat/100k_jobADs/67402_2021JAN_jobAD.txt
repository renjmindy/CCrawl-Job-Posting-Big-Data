  How To Find The Confidence To Defy The Odds In Your Career  
 NaBeela Washington 
 April 20, 2018 
 There are times in your life where everything aligns perfectly, but then there are others where different parts of your life begin to shift, leaving you to pick up the pieces. (Psst! Can’t get hired?  Watch this free tutorial .) When you are confronted with the latter, it’s important to be confident when change presents itself and persevere, no matter the odds. No matter what life throws your way, you must remember that sometimes the things you worked so hard to fortify could at any point in time come crashing down, and that’s perfectly okay. What matters most is your mindset and how you handle the situations to come. No matter how good life seems right now, you should always take the necessary steps to prepare yourself for the inevitable or the profoundly unexpected. Here’s how you can find the confidence, or build off of the confidence you already have, to defy the odds so that you continue moving forward in your life and career. 
 
 1. Remember that not all doors stay open 
 Even though we’d all love for certain areas in our life to maintain consistent or  perfect  , life has a funny way of throwing curveballs to test us and push us towards our best potential. When a door closes, don’t be so quick to try and keep it open. Consider why it’s closing, if you’re actually better off, and what you learned when that door was open. All things come to an end, and it’s important to cherish things while they last and know when it’s best to move on. Remembering this will also help you to grow as a professional. 
 2. Be your best supporter 
 When no one else is rooting for you, or when you find yourself with a shortage of support, it’s important that you remember how to be your own cheerleader. This means shaking off that inner negative nancy and remembering what you’re best at doing. You didn’t get as far as you did for no reason, so remember the progress you've made and how far you still have to go. Avoid internalizing fault for situations that arise or assuming too much responsibility. Things happen, and most times they are out of our control. Breathe and keep your head up. This will help you feel more confident in a job search, navigate sticky situations or life, and roll with the punches. 
 3. Be prepared to put in the work 
 Confidence and defying the odds don’t just happen. They take work, planning, and dedication. Don’t look to others to do the heavy lifting. Be prepared to put in the work so you can reap the benefits later on down the line. Whatever you have to do to work on yourself and grow as an individual, DO IT! Don’t let life, people, or emotions get in the way. Set your eyes on the prize and go after it. After all, the only person who’s standing in the way of your confidence, success, and growth is YOU. The more you prepare yourself for the worst of what life can throw at you, the more reassured and happy you’ll feel when those times happen.
