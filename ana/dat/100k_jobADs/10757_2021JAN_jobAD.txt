 The idea of Qonto was born out of frustration: As Alex and Steve were building their first company (Smok.io - bought in 2015) together, they were very frustrated with their own banking experience. It was not only time-consuming and complex but also didn't include modern tools to suit progressive companies. The two founders decided to tackle these frustrations and to create the service they would have loved to use as entrepreneurs. Our ambition is very clear: building the best business banking service by using technology and design, with a fair and transparent pricing! We think that SMEs have been neglected for too long and that traditional institutions have failed to propose a banking experience adapted to the needs of entrepreneurs 👩💻👨💻. Professional banking should be efficient, attractive and affordable. Our mission is to dust off the old banking experience! We are the ideal banking alternative for freelancers, startups and SMEs, in replacement or in addition to your business banking account. Better than a professional bank account, enjoy a fully-fledged solution to manage your company's finances, whether you are operating on your own or within a team. Our professional current account offers everything you need from Mastercard business payment cards 💳 to financial management tools. We're reinventing the business banking experience 🚀
