 What is a school nurse? 
 School nurses provide health services in schools and other educational settings. Their goal is to treat student injuries or illnesses and advise students, their parents or guardians, and staff on health issues. 
 What does a school nurse do? 
 Apart from injuries and sudden ailments, school nurses may also support students with chronic illnesses and disabilities – for example, by administering medication to them (e.g. insulin injections). School nurses also promote health-related habits (e.g. proper hand-washing) and ensure compliance with national and local health policies for schools. 
 School nurse duties include: 
 
 Providing healthcare to students with acute or chronic health problems 
 Conducting screenings and writing referrals for health services 
 Developing and monitoring health plans for students 
 
 What skills do you need to be a school nurse? 
 School nurses usually have a degree in Nursing and a valid national certification. School nurse job duties require excellent organizational and communication skills. Knowledge of basic computer software is a plus, as nurses often perform administrative tasks, such as updating students’ medical records. When crafting your own school nurse job description, make sure to include all relevant skills as requirements.
