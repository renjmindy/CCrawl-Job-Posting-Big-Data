 If he was given suitable time to acclimate himself to the role, perhaps in save situations Yankees’ reliever  David Robertson  wouldn’t be so tight that a guitar could be strummed across his chest. He’d learn to handle the different mentality and perception-induced pressure of pitching the 9th inning instead of the 8th. 
 Maybe he’d be able to do the job. 
 But in the crisis-a-day atmosphere of the Yankees, they aren’t predisposed to giving anyone time to do anything. Replacing a legend in  Mariano Rivera  only exacerbated Robertson’s plight; that he was supposedly the key to the whole season laid the entire roster and organization on his shoulders and he was neither ready nor equipped to deal with it. 
 Given his shaky start, it’s a moot point how long the Yankees would’ve moved forward with the Robertson-as-closer charade since he got hurt and was replaced by the man they should’ve placed in the job as Rivera’s replacement to begin with,  Rafael Soriano . 
 Soriano, like Robertson, has looked like a different pitcher in the 9th inning. With Robertson that was bad; with Soriano it’s been great. The confidence and desire to be the person on the mound at the end of the game reverted Soriano to the pitcher the Yankees signed for $35 million to be Rivera’s set-up man; the pitcher he was with the division-winning Rays of 2010. 
 In retrospect the Yankees were lucky that Robertson strained a muscle in his side and the decision was made for them. 
 What was most laughable was the reaction—mostly on Twitter and in the media—of those who spend much of their time quoting statistics as a means to bolster their own self-created expertise and would prefer, instead of the designated closer pitching the 9th inning and the 9th inning alone, to have a manager go with the pitchers based on matchups and high-leverage situations while refraining from the  Tony LaRussa  innovation of defined roles for the relievers. 
 Those same would-be “experts” were roasting Yankees’ manager  Joe Girardi  for not having Robertson start the 9th inning—as if that would’ve mattered; as if Robertson hasn’t earned the nickname “Houdini” because he gets himself into trouble seemingly for no other reason than to get out of it. 
 Soriano was getting the night off after having pitched in four of the previous five days including Tuesday night and a hairy save on Wednesday afternoon. 
 Girardi did what the stat guys want. He went with the numbers and used pitchers who, on the surface, were better-suited to do the job in a save situation or otherwise. Sidearmer  Cody Eppley  started the inning against  Alex Rios  and allowed a single. Rios, by the way, is a career 3 for 4 vs Robertson. Girardi pulled Eppley for  Clay Rapada . Rapada got a comebacker from  A.J. Pierzynski  and threw wildly trying to get the double play. Then Girardi brought in Robertson who promptly allowed a 3-run homer to  Dayan Viciedo  to lose the game. 
 Girardi invited the second-guessing by saying that he didn't want to use Robertson too heavily after his injury but also said that he intended to use Robertson even if the double play had been completed. Only he knows if that's the truth or if he didn't want to put Robertson in too dicey a mess not of his own making. Girardi won't come out and say he doesn't think Robertson can close, but empirical evidence and Girardi's experience as a manager, coach and player--experience that  you  don't have--says exactly that. 
 So he went another route, protected his fragile pitcher's psyche, and it didn't work. 
 Do you want a designated “closer” or do you want mixing-and-matching? 
 Do you want to keep putting Robertson in a situation where he’s clearly uncomfortable and in whom the manager and pitching coach don’t place a great deal of faith to do the job? Or do you want to have him start the inning? 
 Do you want to stick to your faulty outsider theories or do you want to come to the conclusion—as hard as it may be—that you don’t know as much as you think you do? 
 Robertson might be able to close eventually, but it’s not going to be this year and it’s probably not going to be for the Yankees as they’re currently structured. 
 This is the truth whether your inexplicably bloated egos can accept it or not. 
 Girardi might be well-advised to stop being a politician trying to keep everyone happy and say what I just said. Maybe then people would leave him alone and let him do his job as he sees fit.
