  No Education or Experience, How Do I Get the Job?  
 Work It Daily 
 May 05, 2009 
 My questions have to do with people who support themselves financially but lack professional training. What advice would you give to someone who needs a higher paying job and wants to work in the field that they are passionate about but lacks the experience to transition right away? Should someone take a second job that has no relevance to their professional goals, or wait to be accepted into a company that can provide the experience that is relevant?  Our Twitter Advice Project (T.A.P.) is no longer an active campaign. To find an answer to the above question, please use the "Search" box in the right-hand column of this website.
