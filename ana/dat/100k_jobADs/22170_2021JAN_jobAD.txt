 Ensure a work environment that upholds compliance with Company policies and procedures, as well as local, state, and federal laws and regulations. 
 Assist in running the store and day-to-day operations in the absence of the General Manager. 
 Utilize personal vehicle to complete bank deposits and other Company business throughout the workday.* 
 Work efficiently in a rapidly changing and fast-paced environment and handle multiple challenging tasks with ease to meet individual and team performance standards.
