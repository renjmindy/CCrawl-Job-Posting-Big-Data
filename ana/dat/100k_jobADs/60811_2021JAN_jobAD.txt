 CMDTY is a well-funded startup that is using technology and data science to create efficiencies in the multi-trillion dollar industry of trading and logistics of physical commodities. We are currently a team of 8 women and 10 men, including technology experts who have revolutionised the ad-tech industry, and commodity experts with years of experience in metals and other commodities. We are based in New York, London, and remote. Having signed our first customer and working on our V1 launch, we are looking to hire more software engineers to join our team in London. What problem are we trying to solve? Think about how easy it is for you to purchase something online; you can see various options, filter by different features, and then once ordered, track where your delivery is until it arrives at your doorstep. It might surprise you that such systems do not yet exist for manufacturers or suppliers who are looking to buy or sell raw material, such as aluminium, copper or cocoa. Thanks to many challenges involved, particularly due to the size of the market, such purchases are currently extremely manual, using a combination of emails, phone calls, text messages to track purchases, sales and deliveries. What do we do? We are bringing market intelligence and pricing tools to small and big manufacturers and producers of physical commodities. By providing financing, price discovery and other facilities we are creating a more transparent marketplace and enabling companies to trade with new counterparties. We are improving logistic and tracking of commodities around the world. This mean optimised delivery routes, with benefits such as a reduction in carbon footprint. Where are we now? Who is the team? We officially started in September 2019, raising a Series A of $10mm. We signed our first customer in July 2020 and are in the process of launching the first version of our product. Our team is currently 8 women and 10 men with a variety of backgrounds, skills and seniorities - from graduates upwards. We have tech experts who have built systems that handle millions of transactions per second, commodity experts with 60 years combined experience in the industry, and award-winning design and product experts who have worked on complex software products for large enterprises. Our founding team has experience starting businesses in both the commodity and technology spaces, and has successfully built companies from the ground up to reach 1000+ employees.
