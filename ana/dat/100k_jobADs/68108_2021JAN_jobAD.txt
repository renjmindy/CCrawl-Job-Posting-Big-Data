  Job Board Detox Tip #5: Do Your Research  
 Lisa Adams 
 August 10, 2012 
 How are you doing on your  job board detox ? Are you finding better uses for your time? Well, todayâ€™s tip maybe a challenge for you. Today you are going to research the companies that you put on your interview bucket list... research them without using job boards! You can do it! Research each company to find out challenges and opportunities. Sources to research besides job boards: Google, Twitter, the company's website, Glassdoor, LinkedIn, Mantra, Zoom Info, and of course your contacts.  Challenges:  Where are they failing / falling down? Are they getting bad press on an issue? Are they less than in the top three in that area? Where do they need help in fixing a problem?  Opportunities:  Did they buy a competitor? Are they gaining market share in an area? Where do they need help in growing the business? The question becomes how can you help them with their challenges or opportunities?   Job board detox research image  from Stockvault
