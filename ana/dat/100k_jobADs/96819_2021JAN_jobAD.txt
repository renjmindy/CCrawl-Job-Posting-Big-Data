 FlexJobs' Top 100 Companies 
 __1.5-minute read 
 Filed under:  News 
 Working Solutions earns its top-tier place again on  FlexJobs’ 2021 remote jobs list,  ranking #4 among 57,000 companies that provide remote work. 
 If you are part of our virtual network of contact center agents, know you’re working for a well-respected company that continues to offer thousands of remote-work opportunities. This year, we are recognized among diverse businesses such as Amazon, CVS Health and Salesforce. 
 In previous FlexJobs rankings, Working Solutions placed #5 in 2020, again #5 in 2019, #10 in 2018, #7 in 2017 and #9 in 2016. 
 Given the pandemic, making the 2021 list carries special meaning for us. Since we began 25 years ago, our virtual model always has benefited agents. Today, it offers work not otherwise available in places across the United States and Canada. 
 Throughout 2020, Working Solutions—along with other companies on the recent FlexJobs list— stepped into the breach as in-office jobs disappeared, filling the gap with work-from-home opportunities.
