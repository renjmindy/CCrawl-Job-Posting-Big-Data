 Work It Daily 
 August 01, 2011 
 Are you one of the 25M Americans who are "between jobs" right now? Working at a job where nobody respects you and you've been repeatedly passed over for promotions? Been looking for a better job for months, but have yet to get even a single response from the 100s of applications you've submitted? If any of the above sounds like you, then you could have " Crisis of Confidence " - and that means you are hurting your job search! In this short video clip  CareerHMO.com  CEO, J.T. O'Donnell explains how Crisis of Confidence projects on to hiring managers like a scarlet letter, causing them to pass you over for consideration.  Photo credit: Shutterstock
