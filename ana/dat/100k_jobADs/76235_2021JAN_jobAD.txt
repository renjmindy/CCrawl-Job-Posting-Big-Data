 It’s “Funny Friday!” I hope this one will add another smile or laugh to the beginning of your weekend. It was sent to me by my cousin, Pat Eddings. **** 
 FUNNY FRIDAY 
 Job Interview 
 Jennifer, a manager at large organization, had the task of hiring someone to fill a job opening. After sorting through a stack of resumés, she found four people who were equally qualified. Jennifer decided to call the four in for a group interview and ask them only one question. Their answer would determine which of them would get the job. 
 The day came, and as the four sat around the conference room table, Jennifer asked, “What is the fastest thing you can think of?” 
 The first person replied, “A THOUGHT. It just pops into your head. There's no warning.” 
 “That's very good!” replied Jennifer. 
 “And, now you, ma'am?” she asked the second person. 
 “Hmmm. . .let me see. A BLINK! It comes and goes and you don't know that it ever happened.” 
 “Excellent!” said Jennifer. “The blink of an eye; that's a very popular cliché for speed.” 
 She then turned to the third person, who was contemplating his reply. 
 “Well, out at my dad's ranch, you step into the house and on the wall there's a light switch. When you flip that switch, way out across the pasture, the light on the barn comes on in less than an instant. Yep, TURNING ON A LIGHT is the fastest thing I can think of.” 
 Jennifer was very impressed with the third answer and thought she had found the right person. “It's hard to beat the speed of light,” she said. 
 Turning to Louie, the fourth and final candidate, Jennifer posed the same question. 
 Old Louie replied, “After hearing the previous three answers, it's obvious to me that the fastest thing known is DIARRHEA.” 
 “What!?” said Jennifer, stunned by the response. 
 “Oh, sure,” said Louie. “You see, the other day I wasn't feeling so good in the gut, and I ran for the bathroom, but before I could THINK, BLINK, or TURN ON THE LIGHT, I had already done it in my pants.” 
 Louie is now the new supervisor!
