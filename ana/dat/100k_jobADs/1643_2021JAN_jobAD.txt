 Looking for a co-founder to share the workload on a bootstrapped travel startup, aiming to go live in Summer '21 (i.e when pandemic is largely over). 
 Without sharing too much info here publically the business is based around matching people with tours and activities (a rapidly growing sector) in a unique way. 
 I'm fairly open as to the background of my co-founder, but a couple of key traits I'm looking for: 
 - Focused on finding solutions to challenges 
- Highly motivated, gets stuff done 
- Scrappy and resourceful 
 Important:  I would need anyone coming on as co-founder to make a similar £,£££ investment as myself (unless they are a developer putting in sweat equity).  Investment will be spend on performance marketing.
