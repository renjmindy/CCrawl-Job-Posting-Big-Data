 The  eBRAIN  laboratory in the Division of Engineering at New York University Abu Dhabi invites applications for a Research Associate / Postdoctoral Associate, to work in the area of energy-efficient wearable embedded healthcare systems for IoT-Edge, with a focus on predictive learning, continual learning, and time-series analysis, and their ultra low-power hardware implementations. 
 The focus of the  eBRAIN  lab is on building energy-efficient and robust brain-inspired, autonomous, and cognitive systems through cross-layer analysis and design methods, engaging hardware, software, and system level techniques synergistically. Prof. Shafique's lab has many-years of R&D; experience in cross-layer design and optimization for building energy-efficient and robust AI and vision systems, including efficient learning and inference of complex AI/ML algorithms, specialized neural processing hardware and design tools, and machine learning security, and their applications in resource-constrained embedded AI systems like autonomous vehicles, UAVs, Robotics, and Wearable Healthcare. The long-term vision of the  eBRAIN  lab is on embedding an energy-efficient and secure electronic brain inside modern cyber-physical systems (CPS) and IoT-Edge devices to enable assistive cognitive technologies that care for / serve humanity and the ecosystem in a safe and green way. 
 The successful applicant will join and drive a number of fascinating projects on designing, optimizing, prototyping and testing embedded wearable healthcare devices, targeting extreme energy-efficiency, robustness, and online/temporal learning. Some example tasks would be investigation and development of compact machine learning models for short-term and long-term predictions, mapping them on embedded GPUs, specialized hardware accelerators for wearables, full-system design with heterogeneous sensors, system/device design and manufacturing (e.g., using 3D-printing and lithography), design for ultra low-power, security and privacy for wearables. These projects have a great potential for devising innovative methods to enable next-generation embedded IoT-Healthcare systems and assistive wearables with non-invasive health monitoring and control. 
 The candidate will work in a multidisciplinary environment consisting of PhD-level scientists, graduate students and undergraduate students, to investigate cutting-edge scientific methods and to develop full-system prototypes. The  eBRAIN  lab offers an excellent working environment in an international team with many development possibilities. The candidate is expected to work in a highly collaborative environment with other lab members and industry collaborators. The candidate will also contribute to Prof. Shafique's international collaborative R&D; projects (e.g., the on-going EU research project titled "Moore4Medical"). 
 Requirements:  Applicants should have a PhD in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Computer Science, or a related field. Extensive knowledge of wearables, machine learning, artificial intelligence, deep neural networks, ML frameworks (like PyTorch and Tensorflow), energy-efficient computing, system-level design and optimization, and hardware design skills (FPGA and/or ASIC) is required. Additional knowledge of statistics, DNN optimization (like pruning and quantization), PCB design, wearable prototyping, and bio-medical devices is highly desirable. 
 Applicants with previous publications at top/A* venues (conferences and journals) of these fields are highly preferred. The applicants are also expected to have strong organization, problem-solving, analytical, communication and writing skills as well as high motivation to pursue world-class research. 
 Application Procedure:  The terms of employment are very competitive and include housing and educational subsidies for children.  Applications will be accepted immediately and candidates will be considered until the position is filled.  To be considered, all applicants must submit the following documents, all in PDF format. 
 
 A cover letter 
 Detailed curriculum vitae (CV) with R&D; and programming skillset 
 Full list of publications 
 University degrees and transcripts, or a letter from supervisor/university officials regarding tentative completion date 
 1-page summary of research accomplishments and interests 
 1-page letter of motivation 
 At least 2 letters of recommendation with contact information of the referees 
 Research statement with an envisioned workplan over 2 years 
 1 page executive summaries of Master and PhD Theses 
 Download links for the PDFs of Master and PhD Theses
