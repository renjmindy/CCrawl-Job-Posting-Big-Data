 Looking for an experienced web developer 
 Published: 19 hours ago  Bids: 10 
 I own and operate a company. I have been building the site myself and am finally realizing I need help as my time is limited. I have a CLEAR roadmap to get me to where I want to go and I need someone to work with me to build it. 
Some of the project work is as follows: 
 - Create product pages and/or landing pages 
- Create memberships 
- Create subscriptions 
- Create bookings and courses 
- Automate any communication 
 I currently use Wordpress with WooCommerce plug-ins to support bookings, memberships and subscriptions. I also have mailchimp for email communication. 
 My chosen website partner (because that's what I want you to be) will be expected to: 
- clearly communicate 
- provide updates weekly 
- ask for assets when needed
