  How To Manage Career Uncertainty  
 Aaron Sanborn 
 January 13, 2021 
   
 In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic greatly disrupted the economy and resulted in layoffs at multiple businesses. 
 It also served as a reminder to professionals that your employment status can change in an instant. 
 No matter how established and comfortable you are in your career, uncertainty can always be around the corner and there are things that you can do to prepare yourself for these situations. 
 Be Honest With Yourself 
 From time to time, it's important to ask yourself,  "Am I happy with my career?" The answer to this question tells you whether you should be building a  career plan  strategy for your current profession, or if you need to shift gears and get yourself ready for a career change. Every job is temporary! People change, businesses change, and obviously the economy is always changing. The key is to have a good idea of the direction that you want to go in if you find yourself dealing with a job loss. Do you want to continue down a similar career path, or make a change? 
 Make Yourself An Indispensable Employee 
 One of the most consistent pieces of advice that we give at Work It Daily is the importance of showing value at your job. Employees who consistently find ways to save or make the company money have a way of making  themselves indispensable . But beyond that, showing a strong work ethic and commitment to your job are all traits that employers value, and they help you build a reputation as an exceptional employee. Even if the worst-case scenario occurred and you still lost your job at some point, all of these accomplishments and traits can be used to market yourself when you're hunting for a new job. Be sure to use numbers and statistics  on your resume to quantify  how you made your previous company more efficient and profitable, and keep in touch with former colleagues and supervisors who can vouch for you as a good employee. Making yourself indispensable may not work 100% of the time, but it's never a wasted effort because your accomplishments will speak for your work ethic and character, and will help you land on your feet. 
 Embrace Career Growth 
 It's important to be a lifelong learner, both in your professional and personal life. Professionally, while it's important to be in the present and focus on your core job responsibilities, it's also important to keep an eye towards the future and think about ways your role can expand. You sometimes hear stories about managers asking job candidates where they want to be in 10 years and the candidate answering  "I want your job!"  While this isn't the ideal way to answer this interview question, it's good to have that type of ambition. Career growth is a multi-step process that starts with excelling at your primary position and then taking on additional responsibilities. From there, it's about gaining the confidence to bring ideas to the table about expanding your role and then seeking  opportunities for promotion . Those who are willing to grow their careers position themselves well in times of uncertainty. But once again, if you do happen to lose your job, this willingness to learn will serve you well on the job search, and impress potential employers. Always be on the lookout for  ways to upskill . 
 Make A Career Change 
 If you're no longer happy with your career, chances are you aren't doing everything you need to do to grow it, and your job may be vulnerable in times of uncertainty. Making a change will not only be a good move for your own happiness, but it's also the better long-term career move. Sometimes career uncertainty and job loss is the push many professionals need to make a change.  Career change  isn't an easy process, but if you take some time to learn and commit to the process, it can be very rewarding. The good news is Work It Daily can help!

  How To Effectively Demonstrate Your Value In A Job Interview  
 Margaret Buj 
 Aaron Sanborn 
 January 06, 2021 
   
 One of the most common reasons candidates get rejected after a job interview is that they don't provide enough relevant, tangible examples of what they've done in their current/previous job that would be relevant to the position they are seeking. 
 When you're looking for a new job, you need to provide specific concrete examples of the competencies listed on a job description—whether it is problem-solving, influencing, taking initiative, or managing change.  A lot of job seekers will give generic examples or just talk about what they've done—but without mentioning specific accomplishments. You could be very good at your current job, but if you struggle to demonstrate your expertise effectively in a job interview, you may miss out on your next career opportunity. Here are a few tips to help you overcome any blocks you might have about talking about your achievements: 
 Discussing Accomplishments Isn't Bragging 
 One of the reasons candidates shy away from talking about their accomplishments is because they don't want to sound arrogant. However, the job interview isn't the time to be too humble. Talking about your accomplishments and using facts and numbers isn't bragging—it's  telling a story . You have to remember that a potential employer wants you to do well in an interview. They are literally looking for an excuse to give out the job! So, tell them what they need in a clear, factual manner. 
 Demonstrate How You Overcome Challenges 
 A great way to answer questions while highlighting your skills and accomplishments is by using the Experience + Learn = Grow model and the STAR technique (situation, task, action, result). What was the situation/problem? How did you solve this problem/overcome this setback? What did you learn from this experience? How did you apply what you learned to your career? These methods are particularly beneficial when you're answering  behavioral interview questions  that hiring managers ask to see if a candidate has enough self-awareness to know what they're good at, and what skillsets need improvement. 
 Use Numbers To Your Advantage 
 Numbers are great for demonstrating your skills and expertise. Did you increase revenue, or save time/money? Did you improve a procedure and, if so, how much time did you save? How many clients did you win in your last job? Don't just tell the employer what the result was. Tell them how you got the result and what your decision-making process was.  Prepare several examples of  quantifiable results  for your next job interview and you'll significantly increase your chances of getting that job offer!  Looking for more advice?

  Is A Career In Finance Right For You?  
 Eustace Brown 
 Jenna Arcand 
 January 05, 2021 
   
 Some people just know that they want to work with money. If you've always had a head for numbers, love a good Excel formula, and have a strong sense of business, then a job in finance might be ideal for you. 
 Okay, it's not the most glamorous of jobs, but entry-level salaries are pretty good. Plus, let's face it, people will always have money and they will need someone to look after it, so a career in this field will be pretty safe, too. To most people, a job in finance is a job in finance. However, like most careers, it is one of many different fields. Do you want to be a banker or an investment manager? A financial trader or a stock broker? A chartered accountant or a tax inspector? Whatever direction you decide to take in the financial services industry will depend on your personality, your grades and qualifications, and where you are able to get your foot in a door. If you have strong analytical and communication skills, work well in a team, are a fast learner, and excel under pressure, then a career in finance might be for you. Here is the lowdown on a few financial positions: 
 Investment Management 
 Investment management is the professional asset management of a number of different financial disciplines such as shares, bonds, and other securities. It commonly refers to the buying and selling of investments to achieve a specific investment objective. Basically, these companies raise capital on behalf of their clients. This could be by trading stocks, helping to facilitate deals, or buying bonds. The starting wage for a job as an investment manager is high, but that comes with huge responsibilities and long hours. Expect to work more than 40 hours a week if you want to be a successful investment manager.  
 Chartered Accountant 
 A chartered accountant is a financial expert. Their job is to provide honest information about financial records, including financial reporting, taxation, auditing, business recovery and insolvency, and general accounting systems and processes. As a chartered accountant, you would mainly be in charge of managing a company's financial systems and budgets, regularly auditing the business' finances, and providing financial intelligence and guidance. 
 Banking 
 A job in a bank can be extremely varied, depending on where you start. Whether you begin your career as a cashier and work your way up to branch manager, or work one of the numerous departments within the bank, working in a branch demands excellent people skills and for you to be organized and good with numbers. Remember, it doesn't just end at cashiers. Working as a mortgage advisor might be more up your alley. Or, you may find your calling in retirement planning or money laundering. There are so many possibilities to consider when looking into a financial career at a bank.  
 Finance Controller 
 A job as a credit or finance controller is ideal for a candidate who is highly organized, forward-thinking, and good with money. As a finance controller, your main role would be to manage and oversee the accounts department, ensuring everything runs efficiently. Finance controllers often manage a team of accountants; day to day tasks include analysis of books, producing accounts, auditing, and reporting to management. 
 Tax Specialist 
 For as long as tax exists, people will need tax advice. The role of a tax specialist is to provide individuals, small businesses, and large companies well-informed, clear, and simple tax advice. Most specialists choose to focus on advising their clients on ways to reduce their tax bills (tax planning) or helping to prepare and submit tax return forms (tax compliance). Tax specialists need to be adept in staying up to date on tax law and liaising. 
 Whether you're looking to start your career in finance after college, or want to make a career change to the industry, these five positions could be perfect for you. We hope this information helps you make the right decision.  Need more help figuring out your career path? We're here for you! Check out our  FREE resources  page and  Live Events Calendar .

  4 Mistakes That Will Derail Your Job Search  
 Don Goodman 
 Aaron Sanborn 
 January 05, 2021 
   
 For some people, it may just take a month or two to go from job hunting to landing that dream job offer and starting work. 
 However, it's not always that easy and smooth of a process. 
 As a job seeker, you may not have much control over the employer's interviewing and hiring process, but you do have control over how you approach the job search process. Avoid the chance of extending your job search or unemployment by being proactive with your job search efforts. Here are four things that will derail your job search, and why you should avoid them at all costs.  
 Procrastinating 
 For some who can afford to take time off from work, that's great—but don't extend the time off to the point of laziness.  The bigger the gap between employments, the more negative it reflects on you. It also doesn't help you make the case that you're a professional who's driven and on top of the game in your profession if you've been  out of work  for an extended period of time. 
 Relying On Applying For Jobs Through Job Boards 
 There are various ways in which you can go about the job hunt. Looking at job boards for the right opportunities and applying to them is one way, but not necessarily the most effective technique.  Employers may receive hundreds of resumes through job boards and the chance of them picking out yours is slim, if your resume even makes it past the Applicant Tracking System (ATS). The best way to get your resume in front of the right person is through a referral from networking. Utilize contacts you have to help get you in front of the right people. Expand your job search to LinkedIn and Twitter. This is where you may make more  direct contact  with the individuals that matter. It's better than sending your resume to the general HR inbox. 
 Settling For The First Job Offer 
 Yes, getting a job offer is exciting, but it doesn't mean you should accept it. Really understand if it's the job you want and if it's a job that will pave the way to where you want to be in your career. If you're unhappy, you'll only wind up back at Step One—job hunting again.  The only exception to this is if you've been looking for a job and unemployed for a lengthy time and you want to use it as a platform to help boost the chance of  landing a better job . It can be easier to impress employers when they know you're employed than if you've been unemployed for a long time. 
 Telling The World You're Unemployed And Asking Them To Help You Find A Job 
 Advertising to your entire network of contacts that you're unemployed and need help finding a job isn't necessarily going to help. This is reaching out blindly where you send a generic resume to everyone you know. What you want to do instead is direct your time and effort to  customizing communication  to select individuals who can help you.  When you send a personal message seeking advice, you're bound to get a better response. You need to put in the effort to get real results in your job search! Don't let any of the mistakes above derail your efforts!  Do your job search efforts need a boost? Work It Daily can help!

  Annual Career Checkup: Your New Year In View  
 Cheryl Simpson 
 Jenna Arcand 
 December 21, 2020 
   
 It's time for your annual career checkup! What changes do you want to make in your work life next year? Do you want a new job or a promotion? Do you want to keep doing the same things work-wise but with a new employer? Do you want to change career directions altogether? Are you happy where you are but want to boost your performance? 
 Regardless of your career situation, the new year offers you a clean slate. If you're a goal-driven person, then you probably set performance targets for yourself at work and in your personal life. Now that the new year is here, it's time to set your career goals for the next 12 months. Remember to keep your goals SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound):  
 What To Consider As You Set Your Career Goals For The New Year 
 Relationships Armed with a list of the most critical relationships in your work life, set a goal for each. What's the one action you can take that will sustain or improve each relationship? Past Goals Are you carrying forward any of last year's goals into this year? If so, make a note of them. In addition, jot down the primary goals you would like to achieve in your career this year. Are you aiming to land a new job or  a promotion  by a certain date? Or are you planning to clarify your career next steps or explore a new industry? Career Trajectory What title, employer type, and industry would you like to be in by the end of this year? Aim high and dream big, and then work backward to detail the path you will need to take to achieve this trajectory. Personal Brand Which elements of your personal brand would you like to refine and capitalize on more this year? How will you do this? What types of projects, assignments, and roles will enable you to  develop your personal brand at work ? Career Values What are the top three career values you would like to honor most throughout this next year? Career Passions What are the top three career passions you would like most to express throughout the coming year? Career Gifts/Talents What are the top two career gifts or talents you would like to use the most this year? Industry Trends Which industry trends are most likely to impact your career in the coming year? What specific actions can you take in the next 12 months to make those impacts as positive as possible? What can you do to mitigate any potential negative impacts? Personal and Professional Development What new personal or work-related skills do you plan to develop this year? What formal or informal training will you complete? Remember that once you officially enroll in a class or program, you can add it to your resume and  LinkedIn profile —just make sure you clarify that you are enrolled and have not yet completed it. Once you've completed the class or program, you can note this completion on your resume or LinkedIn profile as well. Achievements What achievement opportunities exist for you in your current role this year? Are there projects or initiatives that you think will enable you to solve a problem, improve sales, innovate, or help the company to achieve shared goals?  
 Achieving Your Career Goals 
 Once your plan is crafted, put legs under it by tying your goals and plans to specific dates in your planner. Break larger annual goals into small weekly chunks and make sure you access support for each goal you set: Who can assist you in achieving each goal? What information or resources do you need to pursue these goals? What new skills or success habits must you put in place to realize these goals? What changes or adaptations will you have to make, and how will you go about executing those? What barriers to accomplishing these goals are in your way or could arise? How will you overcome these barriers? 
 Put your career plan in a form that feels right to you. Store it where you will see it often (preferably daily) and schedule monthly reviews of your plan. Each month when you reread it, make a note of your progress, successes, and problems. Get help when you need it—don't wait until the year is nearly over to admit that you need support to achieve a goal. Most of all, though, have fun with your goals. Resolutions are supposed to bring us joy! Need help achieving your career goals this year? We're here for you! Check out our  FREE resources  page and  Live Events Calendar .
