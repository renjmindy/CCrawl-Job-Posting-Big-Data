  Poll: How Often Do You Apply For Unlisted Jobs?  
 Belen Chacon 
 March 06, 2013 
 If you’ve made a list of companies you would like to work with on a professional level, you might come across one little problem: the position you want to apply for isn’t listed on the company’s website. That doesn’t necessarily mean the position isn’t open or the company isn’t looking for anyone to fill that position. However, you don’t know if the job is open for sure, and blindly submitting your resume and  cover letter  can bring feelings of uncertainty (i.e. Who do you follow up with? Did anyone even get to read your application? How long should you wait to follow up?). Do you apply for the position anyway? If you do, how often do you  apply for unlisted jobs ? Please take our poll and tell us what you think in the comment section below! [poll id="125"] Photo Credit:  Shutterstock
