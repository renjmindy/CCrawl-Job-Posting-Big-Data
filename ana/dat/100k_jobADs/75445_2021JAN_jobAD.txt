  How To Know When It's Time To Change Jobs  
 J.T. O'Donnell 
 Kelly Kuehn 
 July 26, 2019 
 Remember when you started at your current job? You may have felt excited about the opportunities that were ahead, and the new skills you were going to learn on the job. 
 Fast-forward to present you at your job. Do you have that same excitement? If not, you may want to consider switching jobs. 
 
 Studies show that people who are mentally checked out on the job, but not proactively looking for new work, can end up becoming underperformers. 
 In worse-case scenarios, these people could get fired for poor performance. 
 You don't want that happening to you, right? We don't either. That's why we're giving you this three-step strategy to help you decide whether or not to leave your job. 
 Understand The "Experience + Learn = Grow" Model For Success 
 It may be hard to hear, but if you aren't growing in your career, then you're dying in your career. 
 The experiences you're having at work should be building up your skills, not dragging you down. 
 Every couple of months, take a step back and look at the work you've done.  Have those work experiences made you learn and grow into a better professional? 
 If they haven't, then you're not growing as a professional. That's a problem. 
 Make Sure Your Work Is Enabling You To Grow In Three Ways 
 The experiences you're having at work should help you grow in the following three ways: 
 1.)  Via Financial  -- you want opportunities within your organization that will let your build up your income. You could be looking for a raise, or a promotion, to keep up with your personal goals. It's important to know if your company is giving you the opportunities to achieve this. 
 2.)  Via Influence  -- this is meant in terms power and control over your career. The more influence you have in terms of the respect and the support from your peers and managers, the better. Successful experiences will help you earn their trust and respect. 
 3.)  Via Skills  -- you must stay relevant to your work if you want to be happy with your career. As you build up your skillset, you become more valuable to your employer. 
 If you feel like you're hitting a dead-end in any of these areas, it's time for a change. 
 Make The Decision To Leave (Or Stay), And Stick With It 
 Once you've gone through the first two steps of this process, you know whether or not you've hit some major roadblocks. 
 If you have hit those roadblocks, you can do one of two things. 
 You could sit down with your boss and talk about what you can do to get back on track. 
 Or, you could make the decision to leave. If you make this decision, it's important that you stick with this decision and build up a solid job search plan. 
 You can check out this video for tips on how to conduct an effective job search. 
 At the end of the day, it's up to  you  to decide if it's time to leave your job. 
 That's why it's so important to really think through this decision and decide if it's the right thing to do.
