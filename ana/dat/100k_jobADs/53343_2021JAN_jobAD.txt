 The shelf life of our skills is now less than 5 years so if you didn't learn anything new for the next few years you will most definitely end up socially and economically irrelevant. If you're thinking that's kind of a big problem, you're right! 
 This is the problem we're solving by disrupting the way people learn and grow at work.We're the #1 intelligent learning platform that used by fast-growing scaleups and global enterprises. 
 We're looking for a problem-solving superhero with incredible communication skills and the charm to turn a frustrated customer into a HowNow advocate to join our team on a 12-week internship with the opportunity to go permanent. 
 Here 's the mission, if you choose to accept it: 
 
 Become one of the first points of contact for every one of our customers who have a question, problem, or as it happens, want to share praise or something quirky with us! 
 You will be able to multi-task, respond to customers quickly, send a high number of emails whilst not compromising the quality of customer contact. 
 Communicate issues to the engineers but also communicate with customers in human words. 
 Build a deep understanding of what our community wants, spot trends, and help prioritise our customers' feature requests for our engineering team. 
 
 Typically we find someone with the following will be a great fit: 
 
 Excellent written and verbal communication skills. 
 Significant level of comfort interacting with a high volume of customers over a variety of channels (phone, email, web-based screen-sharing). 
 Demonstrated passion for troubleshooting issues. 
 Demonstrated ability managing priorities in a fast-paced environment 
 High attention to detail and ability to troubleshoot 
 A strong sense of empathy with customers and someone who is a joy to work with. 
 
 Here 's what we offer: 
 
 £1,000 per month for 3 months with the opportunity to go permanent. 
 We invest in your wellbeing: weekly Yoga, HiiT Classes, Team Lunches and Socials. (Covid-permitting) 
 We invest in your growth. Tell us what you want to learn. We've got you covered with a dedicated learning budget and of course the best learning platform out there : ) 
 A team that will inspire you to thrive and have a good laugh while we're at it. 
 As the CEO, I'll take personal responsibility for giving you what you need to make a success out of yourself.
