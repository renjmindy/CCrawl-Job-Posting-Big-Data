 PLAINS TOWNSHIP — With regional unemployment above 9 percent, a job fair in five weeks to fill 250 positions at  Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs ’ soon-to-open hotel/convention center is likely to draw thousands. 
 Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs Assistant General Manager Kara Fox-LaRose on Wednesday said rather than just inviting job seekers to send in resumes or applications, the venue will hold an on-site job fair 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. June 18. Interviews will take place in July and the staff will be hired throughout the summer to be trained, she said. 
 The $50 million hotel and convention center will have seven floors, 238 hotel rooms, a bistro, a 4,150-square-foot Spa Sapphire, an indoor pool and fitness center and the 20,000-square-foot convention center able to seat 850 people for dinners and other events. It also will be able to hold entertainment events for 1,500 people. 
 Its targeted opening date is Oct. 1. It will be the largest hotel in  Luzerne County  and will give the casino the ability to attract customers from farther distances.
