 Grofar selected for BETT Futures 
 October 24, 2016   grofarwebsite 
 At Grofar, we are honoured to be selected for  BETT Futures , the ‘home for the world’s most inspiring edtech startups’. Grofar fulfils a long term ambition to help improve the careers service in schools and raise student aspirations. Grofar was founded by members of the trusted, award-winning team that created  Schoolcomms . 
 Extensive research performed by Grofar identified how important (and often undervalued) the careers service is within schools and how tough a careers leader’s role can be. 
 The Careers Guidance Management Solution, was born to save Careers Leaders time by significantly reducing administrative burden. Grofar is an all-in-one software solution that manages all the complicated processes performed by school careers services. To this end, Grofar has been a ‘game-changer’ in pioneering a new solution to evidence CEIAG and improve student outcomes. 
 Over the course of the BETT show we will demonstrate how to use Grofar to meet  Statutory Guidance , satisfy  Ofsted  and achieve the  Gatsby Benchmarks . 
 Grofar are excited also to be launching our new Employer Engagement platform at BETT. "Employers can offer a wide range of valuable services and resources to schools. Employers want to offer these services and support their communities but lack an easy means. We have created a simple solution to empower both schools and employers and provide full circle engagement", explains managing director James Robertson.

 ‘Careers advice should be a core part of a young person’s schooling’ 
 July 13, 2016   grofarwebsite 2 Comments 
 This week the Government’s Commons Sub-Committee on Education, Skills and the Economy  concluded  that the lack of good careers provision in schools in England was harming young people’s job choices and having a detrimental effect on the economy. 
 In a report, MPs said: "We recommend that Ofsted introduce a specific judgement on careers information advice and guidance for secondary schools, and set clear criteria for making these judgements." 
 "The Common Inspection Framework should be amended to make clear that a secondary school whose careers provision is judged as 'requires improvement' or 'inadequate' cannot be judged as 'outstanding' overall." 
 "Likewise a secondary school should be unable to receive an overall judgement of 'good' if its careers provision is judged to be 'inadequate'." 
 This is a crucial time for schools in England to ensure that their careers advice service is fit for purpose. At Grofar we understand the importance of this and the impact that good careers advice has on student’s futures. Running an effective careers service is time consuming and labour intensive – this is where we can help! 
 Grofar is a complete careers administration solution, available to schools from just £495 per annum. Grofar manages careers service processes and provides a central location for all careers information. Grofar is the solution for schools who want to improve the careers service they offer to students and maximise their staff potential.

 Careers Silver Bullet? 
 June 7, 2016   grofarwebsite 
 In Sir John Holman's 2014, Gatsby report he said that there was no “silver bullet” that would of itself transform the quality of careers advice in schools. Instead, he said schools needed to provide a series of measures to a high standard. 
 His views are based on extensive research in the UK, Canada Germany, Holland, Finland, Ireland and Hong Kong. The English government has welcomed the eight Gatsby Benchmarks believing that they provide an important framework of activities and philosophy of what good CEIAG looks like. 
 The Benchmarks cover all aspects of CEIAG, from achieving a stable careers programme and making this known and understood by students, parents, teachers, governors and employers to providing personal career guidance, best provided by a qualified and registered career adviser. There are also benchmarks for learning from LMI, encounters with employers, FE, HE and other learning providers, work experience and linking curriculum learning to careers. 
 Career professionals will applaud the focus but for hard worked career coordinators and career leaders, the level of expectation, planning, management and organisational skills should not be under estimated. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was asked to calculate the cost of providing such services and estimated it would be £207 million in the first year and £173 million a year thereafter, or just under £45,000 per secondary school in England. Professional career guidance and management and admin skills of this breadth do not come cheaply. 
 At Grofar, we cannot of course offer a silver bullet but what we can do is help schools achieve many of the objectives set out in the Gatsby report, as the table below shows:

 Press Release: Software company launch new solution for schools in response to increasing demands on Careers Leaders 
 April 11, 2016   grofarwebsite 
 Grofar have launched a new software solution for schools, an integrated set of tools that enables Careers Leaders to improve the service offered to students, save time and meet statutory guidance more easily as well as helping them to achieve the recommendations set out in the Gatsby report. 
 The company has created the platform in response to the Government’s drive to increase students’ aspirations and ensure that students leave school "prepared for life in modern Britain". In April 2014, the Gatsby charitable foundation produced the  "Good Careers Guidance"  report by Sir John Holman, who identified eight benchmarks for what good career guidance should look like. 
 Speaking of the launch of the software, James Robertson, Managing Director of Grofar, said: 
 
 In 2013, OFSTED commented that only one in five schools were effective in ensuring that students were receiving the level of careers information that they needed. We carried out our own research and it’s clear that Careers Leaders are under considerable time pressure and lack the tools that are required to do their job well and that a software package could reduce administration and make the careers programme for schools much easier to manage. 
 Grofar offers a great cost-effective solution to schools. Using the information from their existing MIS system, it will help them to meet the key requirements of the Government’s statutory guidance, as well as develop the career aspirations of students from a young age. 
 
 The cost of Grofar’s complete software solution starts from £495. For further information about Grofar, including the features of the Grofar Careers Plan and the Grofar Careers Solution, please visit  www.grofar.com  or email  info@grofar.com .
