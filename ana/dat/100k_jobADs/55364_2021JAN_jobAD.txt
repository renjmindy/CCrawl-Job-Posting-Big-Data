  4 Job Search Alternatives To Applying Online  
 Jessica Holbrook Hernandez 
 September 14, 2016 
 The process of job searching has nearly turned upside-down over the past decade thanks to the Internet and changes that have accompanied newer technology. One of the major adjustments we've witnessed is the manner in which employers accept applications. **RELATED: ** 5 Reasons Why Job Boards Aren’t As Effective Anymore  Primarily, companies require candidates to submit applications via their online systems to improve convenience for all parties involved. But believe it or not, if you’re serious about getting a callback, applying online simply isn’t good enough. 
 
 Job Search Alternatives To Applying Online 
 Here are some job search alternatives to applying online: 
 Getting Back To Application Basics 
 The process of applying for a job has always been a bit of a tedious one, which is why many candidates—and employers for that matter— felt a sense of relief when new programs emerged that allowed applicants to submit their materials over the Internet. Unfortunately, turning in applications online is an impersonal process that results in some resumes never being viewed by human eyes. As a valuable candidate, your job is to ensure a person has the opportunity to see your resume. And while this may not be possible when submitting via the Internet, it becomes easier if you get back to application basics by turning in resumes the old-fashioned way: in person. 
 Additional Ways to Apply for Jobs 
 Are you curious about some alternate ways to apply for jobs when you’re accustomed to taking the online route? Here are a few to consider: 
 1. Mail Your Resume 
 One way to make sure you stand out from other applicants vying for a position you want is to send your resume via snail mail. Better yet, overnight it so that it shows you’re serious about having it seen by a person. 
 2. Apply Via Fax 
 Another option to consider is sending your resume and additional documents via fax. But before doing so, it’s important that you speak with a company representative to not only find out to whom you should address the fax to but also to ensure that it will be picked up. 
 3. Drop Your Resume Off With The Employer 
 If you’ve heard about a potential position or simply want to inquire about opportunities, you can make cold visits to companies where you stop in, ask to see a hiring manager or recruiter and, at the very least, drop off your resume with a human being. 
 4. Attend A Job Fair 
 Finally, a great way to not only put your resume in a company representative’s hands but also increase your chances of scoring an interview on the spot, is by visiting a job fair. These events provide job seekers with an amazing opportunity to use charisma to their advantage before ever being called into an interview. Don’t miss your chance to do the same! It’s always good to remember if an employer carries strict submission guidelines, then you want to adhere to them specifically. But if there’s room to use an alternate route for submitting your application, then by all means, take the extra steps needed to get your resume in front of human eyes.
