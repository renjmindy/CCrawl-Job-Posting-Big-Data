  Down the Hall on Your Left  
 This site is a blog about what has been coasting through my consciousness lately. The things I post will be reflections that I see of the world around me. You may not agree with me or like what I say. In either case - you’ll get over it and I can live with it if it makes you unhappy. Please feel free to leave comments if you wish .

 A Teacher's Reflections : Thirty Years of Wonder 
 
 Best Job Ever 
 Posted on  March 26, 2019 by  Jennie  
 Friday was a rainy day. I played the autoharp, and children sang and danced their hearts out. I love rainy days. I love music. More importantly, children love music. A child came up to me in the middle of the songs and asked, “Jennie, can you play “I Want to Hold Your Hand?” 
 
 Did I hear that correctly? 
“I Want to Hold Your Hand”, by the Beatles? 
Yes, that was exactly the song he wanted to hear. 
 
 
 After I got over my initial shock and excitement, I said, “Better yet, I have the real song, a record album. I’ll bring it in on Monday. And I did. You could have heard a pin drop as I pulled the record out of the album cover with fifteen saucer eyes staring at what was happening. It was wonderful. 
 
 This is as good as it gets. I’m giving a child a song he wants to hear. I’m introducing music on a record player. I’m playing some of the best music from my teenage years, and the children love it.

 Thank you, John. It was a marvelous moment. I think I should show the boy your video.

 I love the reaction of the audience to the boys.
