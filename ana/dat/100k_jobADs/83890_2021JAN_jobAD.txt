 Job Rejected You? Sample Rejection "Thank You" Note 
 By  Ronnie Ann   Leave a Comment 
 So you're probably wondering why anyone would want to thank a company for rejecting them. That's certainly NOT your first reaction. Well, since you didn't get the job anyway, what could it hurt to try once more to connect? This sample rejection thank you note may just help you plant a seed that grows! 
 In my own career, more than once I wound up getting a job that I was not the first candidate for. Well, it was usually because I was trying to talk my way into a job where I didn't have direct experience. (Will talk about that later on in this post.) 
 While not always successful, on occasion persistence can pay off. And so can  networking and relationship building over time . You never know when an impression you leave after an interview leads to a job in the future. Now for that sampleâ€¦ 
 SAMPLE REJECTION THANK YOU NOTE 
 Your name 
Your street address

Your phone number

 Personâ€™s name and title 
Name of company

 Dear (name of interviewer or contact person at the company), 
 Thank you again for the interview opportunity. It was a pleasure meeting (all of) you and getting a first-hand look at ________, a company I would still very much like to work for one day. 
 [Optional short paragraph mentioning something you learned about the company that impressed you or something the person said to you that you take away from the experience.] 
 Please keep me in mind should another opening come up for which you feel I would be a good match. Iâ€™d love the chance to show you just how much I can bring to the job and company! 
 Best regards, 
 (your name)

 More about that rejection thank you note 
 It's important to use your own words when you write to a company. And a format that fits the note you're sending, of course. Email? Snail mail typed / handwritten? (Probably best for this purpose.) 
 While samples and templates can be helpful, borrowed words often ring false. Or just plain empty and boring. Make your rejection thank you letter short (one page), to the point, and personalized based on your interview. Or relevant information inspired by your interview. 
 Also â€¦ please don't be disappointed if you don't hear back from the person or anyone. Seeds can be planted anyway, either for a future job there or one they hear about. Especially if you impressed them. And as I said you have nothing to lose by trying. 
 Most important of all â€¦ keep looking for a job in the meantime. One of the biggest job search mistakes people make is putting all their job search eggs in just one company's basket. 
 Even if this seems like the most wonderful job in the world, the next one might be even better. Or maybe good for you in a different way. But a  job only lets you know if it 's truly good  once you're in it. 
 Some of my "got a job anyway" rejection stories 
 Over the years, I found quite a few jobs because of my  professional network  -- old or new. One job came to me from someone I met at a barbecue, of all places. He was a friend of a friend. Clearly  networking  can happen anywhere! 
 Job story #1 
 Having heard that I wanted to switch to non-profit and inspired by my enthusiasm, he got me an interview with a non-profit company. The power of networking. Oh â€¦ I didn't get THAT job. But I did send a rejection thank you note. ðŸ™‚ 
 Well, despite no offer, the Executive Director liked me. And she recommended me for a job she heard of later on. And I got that job. While I didn't quite have the experience, recommendations from respected people can go far to help your job search. 
 Job story #2 
 My second story about rejection leading to success happened with yet another job I wasn't exactly qualified for. No direct experience with the main function of the job. But I argued that I had  transferable skills  that would match well. (This had been another networking referral.) 
 Although I wound up being their second choice, they offered the job to someone who claimed to be an expert. But she was awful. And luckily they remembered me. Not only because of the original recommendation and my follow-up rejection thank you note, but because I had done one extra memorable thing. 
 Knowing that my direct credentials were weak, I went to visit one of their projects and wrote an article based on my favorable impressions. Leaving a favorable impression is a big part of successful job search. And they called me after they fired the other person, and offered me the job. 
 I took it. And I made lifelong friends. Coincidentally, one of the people I connected with there was a Board member. And he got me to my next job. I think you're seeing the power of both networking and follow-through -- and a strong belief in yourself, even when you face rejection. 
 And if do you keep getting rejected for a jobâ€¦ 
 Maybe your approach needs some brushing up? Sometimes it's as simple as you aren't targeting this specific job directly enough. Or creating that one-to-one connection that can do so much to get you remembered -- and hired!
