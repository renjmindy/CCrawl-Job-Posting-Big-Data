 About Noah 
 Noah's vision is to become the first Starter Kit focused brand, empowering customers to start something new and help them navigate the first steps of their new endeavours. We are equipping our customers with curated Starter Kits and building their confidence beyond the box, through easily accessible content and support for their journey, no matter how big or small. 
 We've seen tremendous growth over the past two years and have recently raised a 7-figure seed-round. Now, we're searching for ambitious, creative and driven people who are excited about the opportunity to build a best-in-class team with a strong culture from the ground up as we scale noah to an international household name.

 Cementing our position in existing market segments 
 Expanding our Supply-Chain across the globe 
 Developing a variety of new Starter Kits 
 Broadening our operations beyond the UK 
 Creating an online community with accessible and engaging content

 you're super organised and have proven your ability to prioritise effectively and meet deadlines

 you have a positive attitude and work well under pressure 
 you're comfortable working independently to draw conclusions and take action, having demonstrated a strong level of comfort in driving projects forward

 what we're doing here at noah excites you!

 Benefits 
 At noah, we believe in building an environment for all team members to flourish in. This means having good work-life balance policies in place to help create room for everyone to use their time as effectively as possible while still hitting big goals together as a business. We don't believe in just 'doing and 'rushing' anything without a thorough plan in place; we prefer to rely on strategic thinking and intelligent project tools to help us to achieve great things collaboratively. Yes, there will be deadlines to meet that may require some longer days but these will always be a team effort and, most importantly, aren't the norm. 
 
 **Work remotely:  **Distance makes the heart grow fonder, so we encourage a sporadic change of scenery whenever you need some time out of the office 
 Generous holidays: 28 Days + Bank holidays + Christmas break + Birthday (Everyone is strongly encouraged to take at least five days off each quarter) 
 **Location:  **Office in a lively Co-Working Space close to Highbury-Islington Station (Victoria Line + Overground). We plan to move to our own amazing office in North-East London within the next 3 months 
 **Share our success:  **We know our future growth is only possible if we all work together as a team, so every full-time team member has share options. 
 **Our team:  **We're an energetic, sociable and talented bunch who are super passionate about what we do and determined to make a difference. We're all in it together and we learn from each other. 
 **Employee Perks:  **We're young and still working out how we reward our employees beyond the standard offerings. As part of our founding team you will be directly involved in helping us shape this offering. E.g. Training budget, getaways (bi-annually), well-being budget, noah credits, regular team events, home office budget 
 
 **Salary Range:  **We are flexible based on experience and this is a vital role in shaping the future of noah, we offer comprehensive share options for our founding team 
 If you have always wanted to join a young and rapidly growing startup as a founding member with significant impact, please do not hesitate to reach out to us! 
 Please send us your CV (PDF) and a short cover letter, including your idea for our next Starter Kit. 
 We are an Equal Opportunity Employer and strongly believe that building a diverse and inclusive team is fundamental to our success. We want to hear from you regardless of your gender, race, religion, age, sexual orientation, marital status or disability.
