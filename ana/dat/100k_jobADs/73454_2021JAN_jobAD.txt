 Opalyn, 
 I'm afraid it would be impossible for you to apply for the said Israel Job in Caregiver because the recruiting agency requires all applicants to personally submit their applicantions. But there is a better option, and that is to apply for caregiver jobs in Canada. Most caregiver recruitment agencies in Canada employs caregivers who are in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan because the processing time for applicants in these countries takes a lot lesser than when you are in the Philippines. So if you wish to view all the available caregiver jobs being offered by recruitment agencies in Canada, just go to the category section of my website Caregiver Work Abroad and click the category Caregiver Jobs in Canada.
