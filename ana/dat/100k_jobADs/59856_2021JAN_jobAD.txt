 (not satire - it's the UK today!) 
 What do unemployed people have to do these days to prove to Job Centre staff that they really are looking for work and avoid being sanctioned? 
 Stand on a street corner all day with a sign around their neck saying '  I need a job, call me  "? 
 Well no actually, because that's exactly what this man did: 
 
And he was still sanctioned by Job Centre staff because they reckoned he wasn't looking hard enough for work: 
 Benefits blow for Wolverhampton billboard jobseeker 
 **Looks like the only way you can get any benefits these days when you don 't have a job is by becoming an MP. **

 I know someone who was sanctioned for applying for a job at the wrong supermarket, and again for not attending his signing on appointment because he was at a training course that his JCP sent him on.

 I know someone who was sanctioned because they were doing workfare and did not prove they were actively seeking work while attending workfare.

 And DWP's wondering (and moaning) why they're getting satirical/cynical/caustic comments about their performance? Fools led by an incompetent buffoon. They should be grateful that it's merely wounding words and not full scale insurrection against them.

 Unbelievable. The job centre's roll is no longer there to help you find work it is there to save money via sanctions. In time the majority of just j.c. staff will work themselves out of a job. It will only be then they will see the error of their ways. Too little too late.

 Unbelievable how the DWP attitude never shows any empathy or just plain common sense,when they look at cases like this. 
Decision makers should be made to stand on a main road junction for 8 hours and see if they think its an easy option to look for work. 
Reblogged, thanks.

 If they sanction you, that justifies a mandatory work placement. If you're on #workfare you don't appear on the unemployment figures, meaning the true figure is hidden, the #DWP crow that unemployment is falling and if so, then the economy must be improving. Smoke and mirrors is the tactic, mass deception the purpose. People need to wake the fuck up and see the true face of the dictatorship we live under. WAKE UP! RISE UP! #REVOLUTION

 nuggy - I have voted SNP and will again, but that's not WHO I am. Has this man also written hundreds of job applications and gone to dozens of interviews, and still kept on trying his best without complaining? That would count for far more than a silly stunt. 
 You need to separate the political and economic environment from the individual stories.

 Likewise he could have turned around to have his photo taken and spent hours at a junction where people are slowing down/stopping. 
 You also don't know what conventional methods of finding work the chap has done. 
 As noted above in my comment and those of others, it is obvious that if the DWP want to sanction someone they will, whether legitimately or not.

 chibipaul - Even if he turned around, did he think car drivers would whip out their notebook and write down his number while they are approaching a junction? …and if I'm trying to convince somebody I'm worth employing then I absolutely WOULD use correct English. Maybe he HAS written hundreds of job applications, but if so, he apparently forgot to tell the Wolverhampton Express & Star about them!

 When you send off another unsolicited letter to an employer do you think they are going to do owt else but file it under "B"? 
 Who knows.unless you give it a shot. 
If this was the sole reason for sanctions it is despicable which ever way I look at it

 I made a caveat because I don't know the full details of what went off any more than you do. 
 You made assertions based on prejudice and bad faith. 
You may jump to conclusions based on what ever delusions you like mate. 
The rest of us will keep an open mind and give an unemployed dude a break.

 No, I based my assertions on the available information, ALL of which suggests that this was NOT a serious or rational attempt at finding a job. There may be more information, but neither you nor I know what it is.

 Perhaps it is a technique that the plebutentes, working for the likes of Avanta and Deloitte-Ingeus (getting rich through the Work Programme) because they cant get a job in a call centre (and have to demean themselves by working in the Sub Prime Welfare To Work Sector) could adopt.

 Dear oh dear. 
 Look at the picture again. Do you think it possible that the gentleman turned round merely so somebody could photograph him? Perhaps he was facing traffic, not away from it. He may have even moved to that position for a good photo, he could have been standing in a known traffic spot where cars are often stopped and can take down his number. 
 Maybe you need to 'FinkFirst'
