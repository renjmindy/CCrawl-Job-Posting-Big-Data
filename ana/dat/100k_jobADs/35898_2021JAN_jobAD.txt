 By Saroj Kar - Research firm  IDC titled in a new report  “  Climate Change : Cloud’s Impact on IT Organizations and Staffing ” sponsored by  Microsoft  reported that the demand for cloud-savvy  IT professionals  will grow by 26% annually until 2015 and will create more than seven million cloud-related vacancies worldwide. 
 This gap in skills is even more alarming as almost  two-thirds of global firms are planning to implement or use cloud technology  and more than 50% of companies agree that the cloud is a priority.  more> http://tinyurl.com/a6u9y9z
