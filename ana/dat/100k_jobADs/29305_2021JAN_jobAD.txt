 Disability History Month: Jordan Freud on being autistic, graduating and getting a job 
 As Disability History Month 2020 comes to a close, we asked English and Comparative Literature graduate Jordan Freud to give his personal account of entering the job market with autism. 
 After several years of experience with LSR and LSTV, as well as doing a year in industry at Mind The Gap (a theatre company for the learning-disabled), he now works for Raw TV as a Talent Assistant and regularly does freelance theatre production. 
 In this video, he discusses: 
 
 the  importance of doing a year in industry 
 being autistic, ableism and why this is a vlog 
 his  university journey with autism , 
 job searching and employability 
 top tips for job searching 
 disclosing disabilities and asking for reasonable adjustments 
 where is he now? 
 
 This vlog is part of a series of activities organised by Careers for #UKDHM2020. Earlier this month, we ran a  Being Your Own Boss  workshop with Evenbreak and SPARK, and a special panel discussion event called  Employ-able: Celebrating Disability in the Workplace . A few months ago, final year student Georgie Fuhri wrote a comment piece for this blog on  discomfort in disabilities  for both employers and graduates. 
 If you need support and want to disclose your condition, find out how  Disability Services  can help you.
