  5 Career Paths In Interior Design  
 Devney Walsh 
 May 13, 2013 
 There are many  career paths in interior design  that you can venture into. As long as you are happy and accomplished, it does not matter what type of designer you are. 
 
 5 Career Paths In Interior Design 
 Two things can provide a massive jump start to your interior design career. You will be expected to have obtained an interior design bachelors degree and be accredited by the Council for Interior Design Accreditation (CIDA) or the National Council for Interior Design Qualification (NCIDQ). After that, the world is yours. Here are five interior design career choices to consider: 
 1. Interior Designer 
 This is the most obvious route for most designers. As an interior designer, you will be tasked with making the interiors of homes, offices, and other buildings beautiful. Interior designers have to be creative, understand color theory, and keep abreast with emerging interior design trends. The designers may work with residential or commercial clients. Residential interior designers are mostly involved with styling and interior decorating, fabrics and furnishing. Commercial interiors designers may work in retail, offices, restaurants, hotels, and education institutions. 
 2. Furniture Designers 
 Furniture design is a more specialized part of interior design. As a furniture designer, your work can be twofold; with the client and with other suppliers. When working with a client, you may be tasked with arranging furniture at houses, showrooms, offices, and other areas to use space optimally, bring out desired themes and so on. You may also work with your client’s suppliers such as carpenters, guiding them on what decorations to incorporate in the furniture to bring out your client’s tastes. 
 3. Exhibition Designers 
 Exhibition designers provide working layouts and decide the décor to be used in exhibition halls. The designers need to be knowledgeable on modular stand design, custom build designs, exhibition and museum design, and floor management. Other skills required include CAD and 3D packages like Adobe Suites and AutoCAD/Vectorworks. When working on projects, the designers take into consideration the traffic expected at the exhibition hall, items that will be showcased and the theme of the exhibition. 
 4. Lighting Designers 
 Lighting designers ensure adequate lighting for the various projects they are involved in. The designers have to be knowledgeable in basic wiring or work with a qualified electrician to bring out various creative lighting effects depending on the nature of the projects. Lighting designers may also be involved in schematic design and work on decorative products such as light fittings, shades and luminaries for a design consultancy or manufacturer. Knowledge in different types of lighting and their effects is crucial to the success of a lighting designer. 
 5. Kitchen Designers 
 Kitchen designers are primarily involved with kitchen aesthetics and usefulness to the people who use them. The designers can work hand in hand with constructors to determine the floor plan or can come after the floorwork has been done to help clients with kitchen items. Kitchen designers should balance both design and functionality of the items they recommend in the kitchen. The designers should know the effect of kitchen temperatures on the decors they go for, the maintenance required, and general replacement procedures. Advice to students who desire to pursue an interior design bachelors degree: Always listen to what clients need and want. To be successful, creativity, passion for color, and skill for vision are a must. It is also advisable to further your education or train under a skilled interior designer before you start working independently. Regardless of the  career path  that you take, remember, interior design is not just about how the space looks, but also about how it functions. Becoming an interior designer is a demanding career and you must be passionate to succeed.
