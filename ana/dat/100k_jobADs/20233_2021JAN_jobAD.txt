  4 Ways To Upskill At Work To Get That Promotion  
 Margaret Buj 
 Jenna Arcand 
 January 27, 2021 
   
 Promotions are not guaranteed. In the past, employees used to progress along specific career paths, often within just one organization. However, with the impact of globalization and technology and flatter organizational structures, this has changed. 
  Today, we have to create and manage our own careers. Often the promotion isn't an upward path, either, and we may need to take a lateral move first to be able to position ourselves for an upward move later. To get that promotion, it is important to boost your  personal brand  and get yourself noticed. Making yourself heard, developing mentoring relationships, practicing effective self-promotion ,  being a problem-solver, acting professionally at all times, being a team player, and developing your network are all effective strategies. However, there are also ways you can upskill while in your current job: 
 1. Expand Your Knowledge And Skills 
 In order to get  that promotion , it is important you expand your knowledge and skills in areas that are important to your organization. If you want to get ahead, it is important not only to keep up with current industry news, but also to pay attention to trends outside of your area of specialization. Staying informed is not difficult—simply subscribe to some of the leading sources online and devote even just 30 minutes each week to reading. Book this time in your calendar like you would any other appointment, otherwise it is not likely to happen if you're busy at work. If you've read something you think will be of particular interest to your team, send them a link. Sharing what you learn will show that you're a team player. 
 2. Ask For More Responsibilities 
 To increase  your value within an organization , you can ask for more responsibilities or even volunteer to help other departments. When you ask for more work, it shows your interest and desire to help your department and organization to succeed. It also puts a spotlight on how much value you bring to your company. 
 3. Create Your Own Opportunities 
 If you've been working at your company for a while, chances are you know one or two areas that have been neglected. If you do have key skills to help in that area, write a proposal for a new project, or even a new position for you. Even if the proposal doesn't get accepted on this occasion, you'd have shown your initiative and creativity. This can only help you next time you request a promotion. In general—and this is the main benefit of  nurturing your network —the more people who know you, know your abilities and value you bring, know of your ambitions, the more likely it is that your name will be discussed when some opportunities arise. 
 4. Seek Professional Development 
 Continuing to develop your skills can help you expand your current role or put you on a fast track for that promotion. Research courses relevant to your role—or the role you want—and if you can demonstrate to your boss how it could be beneficial for you and the company, they might even cover the cost. Professional development doesn't need to be restricted to your office hours. There are so many  online or weekend courses  available and if there is something which you feel will help you with career progression, invest in it yourself. Then, make sure your manager is aware that you've taken the initiative to upskill. 
 Apart from upskilling at work, a really simple way to stand out is by documenting your success in your current role. Keep a record of everything you do that enhances the company's bottom line, that puts the company or your department in a good light, that receives good feedback, or is innovative. Finally, be genuine and likeable. Always be yourself while at the same time boosting your personal brand to secure the next step in your professional journey. I hope these tips help you.

  5 Benefits Of Working For The Federal Government  
 2U 
 Jenna Arcand 
 January 26, 2021 
   
 USAJOBS, the primary portal for federal job seekers, launched a streamlined application service for college students and recent graduates called Pathways to better assist them with finding government work. While this is certainly welcome news in a competitive job market, one might wonder why there is so much interest in government jobs in particular. 
 By way of an answer, here are five benefits of working for the federal government. 
 1. Job Security 
 Increased job security is a valuable commodity, especially in an uncertain economy, and the federal government provides it. Compared to public servants, private employees are at a much higher risk for being terminated; in fact, they are three times likelier to be terminated by their private employer than employees of the federal government are.  
 2. High Compensation Increases 
 Federal employees receive competitive salaries with the added benefit of high compensation increases. From 1951 to 1991, the average state and local government employees received $1.37 in compensation increases for every $1.00 received by the average private employee. Federal civilian employees received $1.91. Since 1980, the pace has increased, with average state and local employees receiving $4.78 for each $1.00 received by private employees. 
 3. More Vacation And Holidays 
 Over the course of a career, state and local government employees and federal civilian employees receive nearly 1.5 years more in paid vacation and holidays than the average private employee. The average state or local government employee has 9.9 more paid vacation days and holidays than their private counterparts, a figure that increases to 13 for federal employees. Increased vacation time means that employees are properly compensated for their work hours and given ample time and resources to properly recharge so as to better function in their jobs. The government tends to offer its employees more paid sick and personal days as well. 
 4. Generous Health Benefits 
 The Federal Healthcare Benefits Program, or FHBP, provides the widest selection of health care plans of any U.S. employer. Though government health care benefits tend to pale in comparison to those offered by private employers while an employee is working, most government health care plans provide superior benefits to retirees than do private health care plans. 
 5. Generous Retirement Benefits 
 Speaking of retirement, federal employees tend to have the option to retire earlier than their private sector counterparts and have access to superior retirement plans through the Civil Services Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS). Under both plans, retired employees receive an annuity, complemented by Social Security benefits and participation in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), which offers 401(k)-type investment options. Retired federal employees also have the option of continuing health benefits at the same monthly cost that they paid before retirement. 
 If you're looking for a job with a lot of benefits, a federal government position could be right for you. There are pros and cons associated with every job, but the pros of a federal job are definitely something to consider during your job search.  Need more career help? We're here for you!

  How To Get Hired With A Criminal Record  
 Work It Daily 
 January 25, 2021 
   
 "Fair Chance" job filter It's difficult enough to get hired nowadays without having a criminal record. So, is it even possible to land a good job after committing a crime? 
 The short answer: yes.  But it's not going to be easy, unless you follow these three steps during your next job interview.  
 1. Come Up With Your Explanation 
 Employers will conduct background checks on you. The old rule of thumb was that a felony comes off your record after seven years, and it does. But the internet has a much longer memory than that. Your criminal record will probably always be up there for employers to find. If you have any record with the police, HR can (and will) find it. So, it's important that you tell employers about your criminal record before they find it out for themselves and then hold it against you in the hiring process. A key thing to remember as you look for a job with a criminal record is that It's not about overcoming your criminal background; it's about working through it.  Before you mention your criminal record to a hiring manager, come up with your explanation. Use the "Experience + Learn = Grow" model, which is the same strategy you should use when  answering behavioral interview questions . Tell the employer the facts. Take all of the emotion out of it. Don't make excuses. Simply tell them what the situation was and what happened. Then, tell the employer what you learned. What did this powerful experience teach you? (Don't focus on the negative.) And how did you grow from this experience? 
 2. Take Responsibility For Your Actions 
 Let's be honest: we don't like to admit that we did something wrong, that we failed or made a mistake. When we own our mistakes and failures, we have to admit that we're not perfect. And no matter how many years we've been on this earth, that's still something a lot of us struggle with. If you own something, you can change the outcome. And that's what you need to do when looking for a job with a criminal record. Take responsibilities for your past actions and mistakes. If you don't own it, then you're helpless. Whatever you do, don't have a victim mentality. Don't think someone or something has control over you. By owning it, you can make things better. The hard truth is that trying to defend yourself, trying to push some of the blame on something else, really hurts your credibility. If you don't say, "I own it. There were other factors involved, but I own it," during your  job interview , no one is going to trust you. We understand that it's really hard to own the mistakes you've made if you haven't yet come to grips with them. Just know that you will have to in order to get a job, and that it will be so incredibly freeing.  
 3. Show The Employer How You've Changed 
 After you've explained the "grow" part of the "Experience + Learn = Grow" strategy, you'll want to have examples for  how  you've grown as a person and as a professional. It is very hard to gain people's trust when you're looking for a job with a criminal record. It's very hard to get a job at all. Tell the employer this, and then show them what you've done to earn people's trust again. Try framing the conversation like this: "This is what I've done to try to build my reputation, gain trust, and  develop my skills  since then. Here's where I am, and here's what I'm doing going forward. Here's what I'm doing to put this behind me so it's not an issue anymore." Employers need to hear this. They need to know you've gone through that thought-process and have grown and changed as a person since committing the crime. If they can walk away from the job interview knowing that you own your mistakes, learned from them, and have bettered yourself since committing the crime, they won't hold your criminal record against you as much as they would have if they had found it before you brought it up. 
 Companies That Hire Individuals With A Criminal Record 
 Over 100 organizations have joined the  Fair Chance Business Pledge , including: American Airlines Best Buy CVS Health Facebook Google Intel Microsoft Starbucks Target Unilever Walmart There's also a great feature on LinkedIn that helps users with a criminal record. The  "Fair Chance" job filter  makes it easier for applicants to find employers who are open to hiring them.  
 So, take responsibility for your criminal record. Make sure you're the one to bring it up first during the hiring process. As long as you prove you've learned from your mistakes and have developed the skills necessary to succeed on the job, you'll be viewed as a good job candidate. Good luck!

  How To Match Your Skills To A Job With Your Resume  
 Jessica Holbrook Hernandez 
 Aaron Sanborn 
 January 26, 2021 
   
 Have you ever wanted to apply for a job you realized did not completely match your skill set? 
 It's happened to all of us at some point in our careers, especially when attempting to switch fields. The good news is, winning a position when not fully qualified is completely possible. By using your resume as a tool, you can show just how great of a candidate you are. 
 Here are some ways to set up your job search, and potential career change, for success. 
 Read The Job Posting Carefully 
 The first step in ensuring you  add skills to your resume  that align with those required by a specific position is to read the job posting carefully. Doing so not only shows you exactly what's required of the job but it also helps you examine your own skills that match.  For instance, if a company mentions in its job posting that it is looking for an administrative assistant with strong organizational skills and experience setting up meetings for company executives, you know you need a certain take-charge attitude to ensure the office is organized. Now, you can include your own organizational skills—and even show proof that you've interacted with top executives in the past. 
 Think From The Hiring Manager's Perspective 
 Thinking from the perspective of a hiring manager is not always easy to do, but it is possible—and necessary—if you want to add the right information to your resume. To start, read the job posting and even take a few moments to  learn more about the company  itself through its website or other sources.  Then, think about what you would hope to see on someone's resume if they set it on your desk. Would you expect to receive resumes from people who only have experience as models or background dancers? No. You would want to see how their experience relates to the position they're applying for. Using this perspective while writing can help you create a resume that will get you hired. 
 Show You Can Learn New Skills 
 It's important to showcase your ability to learn new skills by highlighting previous training, along with a willingness to take on new projects. One way to do this is by listing any training courses you've taken, certifications you've received, programs you're proficient in, and any other details that prove your ability to hit the ground running.  Some people who have acquired their dream jobs did not have all of the experience needed to claim the position—but they did submit a resume that helped them score an interview where they could then prove that they were right for the job. Don't let a lack of skills stop you either. Take the  steps necessary to make your skills a perfect match  for the job you deserve. Now that you know how to match your skills to a job, which position will you land? Is your job search ready for the challenges ahead? Work It Daily wants to help!

  What's Your Workplace Communication Style?  
 Aaron Sanborn 
 January 22, 2021 
   
 Have you ever wondered about how you communicate with others? **** 
 How you interact with others plays a  major role  in both your career and life in general. 
 It can be hard to categorize yourself, but it's extremely helpful to have an idea of how you communicate with others, and get a sense of how others perceive you. This type of self-assessment is important in figuring out how to market yourself as an employee that adds value to the workplace. Fortunately, Work It Daily has a  FREE Workplace Communication Style Quiz  that can help determine the communication. 
 What's The Communication Style Quiz? 
 The Communication Style Quiz allows you to understand your communication style so you can work more effectively with others. It has 18 questions about your personality and how you handle certain situations. An example of a question includes: What describes you best? A) Do not like pressure situations. B) Don't mind pressure situations if can move things forward. At the end of the quiz, you'll get your result. An individual's communication style breaks down into four categories: Empathizer, Energizer, Contemplator, and Commander.  Which one are you? 
 What Do My Results Mean? 
 The communication style results page gives a full rundown of each style, including each style's strengths and weaknesses.  Can you guess what communication style you are? Here are a few characteristics of each one: Empathizer: Warm, tactful, avoids conflict. Energizer: Open, upbeat, and outgoing. Contemplator: Calm and reserved. Commander: Serious and direct. You might be surprised by your results. The only way to know for sure is to  take the quiz . 
 How Do I Apply My Results To My Career? 
 Understanding your communication style can help you better interact with your co-workers. Understanding how you interact with fellow co-workers is especially important if you just started a new job and are the  " office newbie ." Although you might think you have a firm grasp on how you communicate with others, you might not realize how you could be misinterpreted by co-workers, which could lead to some awkward situations and unwanted workplace conflict. Having a better understanding of your communication style is also helpful for networking and job interviews.  Networking can be tough, so having a handle on how you communicate will help you adapt your  networking strategy , while potential employers usually ask job seekers to describe themselves during job interviews. 
 Don't Let Your Communication Style Hold You Back At Work 
 There are so many reasons to understand your communication style. In fact, if you don't take the time to learn the pros and cons of your communication style, you could seriously hurt your career. If you feel out of place at work or constantly get passed over for promotions, your communication style could be to blame. Looking for other ways to stand out in the job search?

  The Most Important Part Of Your Resume  
 Jessica Holbrook Hernandez 
 Jenna Arcand 
 January 21, 2021 
   
 What's the most important part of your resume? We hate to say it, but the attention span of hiring managers seems to be getting shorter. 
 In fact, I was speaking with an executive-level individual the other day (who regularly reviews resumes) and he commented about how quickly he can scan through a stack of resumes and choose the candidates he plans to call. He admitted that it really is an unfair process—that so many job seekers are judged solely by the quality and presentation of their resumes (documents that too often are afforded a review of only a few seconds). And if it's a poor presentation, or boring to the reader, or just doesn't communicate the right message, they are quickly passed over. It's a given that the average employer will invest only a few seconds—literally—in his or her initial resume scan. So, it's critically important to your candidacy to ensure that the part of your resume in which he or she is willing to invest five seconds of attention grabs—and keeps—their attention. So, where is the employer's attention going first? And how can you make the most of that section of your resume?  
 The First Third Of Your Resume Is The Most Important 
 The top third of your resume is where the employer will direct the bulk of his or her initial resume scan. So, what you put here is vitally important. If it's boring, too text-dense, or doesn't speak to the position they're trying to fill, you're sure to be passed over. 
 What Should You Put In This Critical Section? 
 The top third of your resume should contain the most dynamic, persuasive, and noteworthy information about yourself and your career. Top load your resume with skills, accomplishments, and quantifiable results that are the most applicable to the position you're applying for. Here are some critical areas:   The contact information – Include links to your  LinkedIn profile , career blog, or professional website. Direct the hiring manager to places where he or she can find more engaging information about you. The headline – This is not a job title. It's where you summarize the problem you solve for employers, keeping in mind your  personal branding statement .  The experience summary – List 6-8 skills that are needed for a certain position. These are not soft skills. They are hard/ transferable skills  that will help you succeed in the job you're applying for. Remember: the employer has a need they're trying to fill, and if what you are known for meets that need, you've just become very employable. After you've caught the eye of the employer with your top third, they will be inclined to spend more time on your resume and read further. Your work history section should not contain any  resume fluff . It also should not be a summary full of generic statements that are vague and speak nothing to who you are or what you bring to the table as an employee. This is the time to set yourself apart as a candidate. Use specific keywords and  quantifiable information  in your bullet points under each job title. This will impress the hiring manager and make you stand out in a sea of job applicants.  
 Employers want to see results, and they want to know what you've accomplished in the past. Having a friend or family member look over your resume and then provide an opinion is nice when it comes to proofreading and pointing out errors within the resume. But someone who knows you and has a vested interest won't be able to really tell you in an unbiased way if your resume is boring. Try to have an unbiased third party give you some feedback on how engaging they consider your resume. Need more help with your resume? We're here for you!

  What The "Best Companies" Did Right In 2020  
 Aaron Sanborn 
 January 20, 2021 
   
 Job review website Glassdoor recently released its "Best Places To Work 2021" lists. 
 These lists can be a good resource to job seekers putting together their job interview bucket list, and there are some interesting things that can be learned from them. 
 According to  Glassdoor's list  of 100 large-sized companies, the top five companies to work for are: Bain & Company NVIDIA In-N-Out Burger HubSpot McKinsey & Company And of the 50  best small to medium companies , the top five to work for according to the list are: Life.Church Crew Carwash Ike Pariveda Solutions Malouf All of these companies are great in their own right, but in 2020 they had these three things in common. 
 They Adapted Quickly To COVID-19 
 The COVID-19 pandemic impacted every business in some way in 2020. In many cases, it resulted in companies having to go completely remote and embrace greater schedule flexibility. Any drastic change brought on by an emergency is never easy, but it also brings with it opportunity to make some  positive changes . The companies on Glassdoor's lists were able to find some way to accomplish this. In the case of  HubSpot , the software developer already had a large remote workforce, which helped in the transition of going entirely remote. The company also tried to ease the transition for employees. "During COVID, we went remote pretty easily, but they changed our free ebooks program so we could order however many ebooks/audiobook we wanted, gave us a work from home stipend, and a mental health day," one employee said in a Glassdoor review. NVIDIA, a computer game/AI company based in California, was also quick to switch to remote work and opened up several online resources to employees and their families, including webinars on mental health, mindfulness, and resilience. The company also provided families with access to online educational courses, virtual field trips, entertainment ideas, and online story times. "Since the pandemic began, every effort has been made to provide for and protect employees as human beings, from ergonomic furniture subsidies and flexible schedules due to family obligations, to careful and strict regulations and accommodations for the handful of essential employees who do come on campus," a NVIDIA employee wrote in a Glassdoor review.
 Focusing On Diversity & Inclusion 
 Encouraging diversity and inclusion in the workplace has been a major goal of many businesses for several years, but some of the events of 2020 served as a reminder that both the nation and the workplace have a long ways to go in creating a truly inclusive environment. The first step is understanding  diversity and inclusion  and why it's important, and then putting together  a plan . The companies on Glassdoor's lists are all taking positive steps to move in this direction. Bain & Company, a global management consulting firm headquartered in Boston, has created a number of affinity groups for its employees of different races and backgrounds to come together to form connections and to give their input on creating a workforce of diversity, equity, and inclusion. The company has also invested into the cause by committing $100M to global pro bono investment over five years to promote racial equality and social justice and a $1M match in employee donations to organizations focused on racial equity and social justice. "They are really investing in diversity, equity and inclusion in the current environment. A lot of work yet to do as is true with most companies but they are putting in the work. It is encouraging," one employee wrote on Glassdoor. Ike, an autonomous trucking company based in San Francisco, has received high praise from its employees about the company's diversity and inclusion efforts.  The company has two diversity and inclusion tasks forces—one focused on internal learning and impact and one focused on helping employees getting involved in the community. Ike also hosts regular discussions about diversity, equity, inclusion, has a book club that meets monthly, mentors students from underrepresented communities, and has a series of events and brown bags to help celebrate the company's diversity.  "The folks are friendly and nurturing. I am an underrepresented demographic in the tech industry and I have been calling my underrepresented friends to check out Ike. If you want to be/feel included I encourage you to check out Ike. The vibe is like no other I have ever felt and it is a good feeling," an Ike employee wrote on Glassdoor.
 The Companies Have Been Here Before 
 Building a  strong culture  from the ground up is a rewarding process that takes time. But, if your company has an established workplace culture, it's a lot easier to fine-tune and add to it. This is reflected in Glassdoor's best companies list. All top five large companies have made the list at least seven times, with Bain & Company making the list the most at 13 times. All five companies also ranked high for leadership with their CEOs making Glassdoor's Top CEO's list. In the case of the top five small to medium companies, only Ike made its debut on the list, with every other company making the list two or more times. The combination of strong leadership, listening to all employees, and adapting to change seems to be the key to staying power on the "best companies" lists.
