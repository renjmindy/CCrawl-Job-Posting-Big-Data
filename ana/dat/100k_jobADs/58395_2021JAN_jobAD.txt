  Are Your Career and Life Goals Congruent?  
 Bud Bilanich 
 August 19, 2011 
 Success Tweet : Create goals in all areas of your life: career, personal, business, family, hobbies, health and fitness. Make sure they are congruent.  Since I am self employed, my career and business goals overlap. I have personal goals that overlap with my health and fitness. Biking and reading are my hobbies. I have goals for them, too. My most important goal is to be a loving and supportive husband. My career and business goals focus on helping others succeed, getting my career success coach message out in as many different ways as I possibly can, and making enough money to let me travel less and work from home more. I have lost quite a bit of weight in recent years. My personal and health goals focus on maintaining that weight loss and losing even more. I have a long term goal of doing a metric century bike ride (62 miles) in 2011. I have another goal to reread several of Tolstoy’s works this year. I have goals for our marriage as well. My marriage goals intersect with my business and career goals. The more time I spend at home, the more time I have to devote to our relationship. See how this works? What are the important parts of your life? Do you have goals in each of them? Are these goals congruent? Even though I am a  career success  coach, I urge you to spend time thinking about both your life and career success. Create goals in all parts of your life. Make sure these goals are congruent. You’ll be happier – and more likely to achieve the career success you deserve --this way. The common sense career success coach point here is simple. Successful people are well rounded. They set and achieve goals in all facets of their lives. What are the important parts of your life? Do you have goals for each of them? If not, create some. Follow the advice in Tweet 27 in  Success Tweets  ,  “Create goals in all areas of your life: career, personal, business, family, hobbies, health and fitness. Make sure they are congruent.”  Pay particular attention to being congruent. Your goals need to complement one another. If they don’t, you’ll find yourself trying to juggle competing priorities. This is difficult at best, and often leads to failure on several fronts.  Congruent goals  on the other hand will complement one another and lead to your life and career success.  Bud Bilanich, author of the FREE e-book called, " Success Tweets ," is a motivational speaker and blogger who will help you create the life and career success you want and deserve.
