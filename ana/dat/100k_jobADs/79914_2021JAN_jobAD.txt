 JOBS AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES IN GRABS 
 The Willi Elbe Group’s factory in Grabs was founded in 1960, giving it a long and proud tradition within the company. Originally created to facilitate deliveries to the European Free Trade Association as a counterpart to the EEC (European Economic Community), the location in Grabs is today an integral part of the company and concentrates on small series production and assembly. In the 3,000 m² facility, 25 employees work in the field of precision metal cutting, welding technology, and steering column assembly for tractors and busses. 
 We currently do not have any vacancies. 
 Living and working in Grabs 
 The town of Grabs, with its almost 7000 residents, lies in the Swiss canton of St. Gallen. This Alpine region is beautifully forested, and nestled between the mountains at an elevation of 1123 meters lies the stunning mountain lake known as the Voralpsee. Hikers and cyclists will certainly appreciate the rich landscapes of the neighboring Werdenberg region. And for those hungry for culture, a visit to the Schlossspiele, an opera festival held every three years in the Werdenberg Castle, should not be missed. A strong cultural heritage is a large part of the region’s charm. From the Silvesterschläuse, or New Year’s Eve celebration, in Oberschan – a tradition similar carnival in Europe– to the Älplerchilbi (a thanksgiving celebration) and the yearly fairs held in the village square, these traditions will be sure to delight any newcomer to the region. Grabs is also an ideal starting point for trips to the Bündnerland and Lake Constance, the Appenzellerland, and the neighboring Principality of Liechtenstein. Here is just a small sample of the many attractions nearby: 
 Werdenberg Castle 
 City of Werdenberg 
 Racket Trophy 
 The Walensee
