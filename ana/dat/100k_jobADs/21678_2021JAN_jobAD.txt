 In a  previous article , I looked at some ways of discovering what you want in life. 
 Those ways are a good start, but they often leave a lingering feeling that there’s something more that you actually want. 
 This article is about a quick, simple way of taking that next step.

 Life at Uni: Will the world end if I fail my exams?

 The short answer, in case you were in any doubt, is “No”. 
 The world won’t end if you fail your exams. 
 At one level, you already knew that. The planet won’t be destroyed if you don’t get the exam grades you wanted. However, there’s another version of the question that bothers a lot of students. It’s about whether their personal world is going to be destroyed by exam results. 
 Again, the answer is “No”. This article is about the reasons for that answer. It’s another gentle, supportive article with practical advice. To set the mood, here’s a picture of a sweet little kitten.
