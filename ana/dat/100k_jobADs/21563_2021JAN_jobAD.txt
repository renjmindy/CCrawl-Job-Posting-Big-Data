 CROPSS â€“ Inspiring biology students to consider careers in crop protection 
 
 A couple of years ago, the BBSRC decided to scrap one of their most successful and inclusive PhD training awards, the  iCASE . In their own words,  BBSRC will no longer operate an annual competition for industrial CASE (iCASE) studentships, instead allocating the majority of these studentships to the BBSRC Doctoral Training Partnerships (DTP) for awarding alongside their standard studentships.  **** At one fell stroke the BBSRC reduced the diversity of their PhD portfolio by a significant amount and also dealt a huge blow to those of us working in crop protection, at a time when food security and the need to feed the world is of paramount importance. Later that year the BBSRC, possibly in response to those of us who kicked up a public fuss about the loss of the iCASE scheme came up with a very  inadequately funded scheme called STARS  aimed at getting undergraduates interested in some of the vulnerable skill sets that the BBSRC by their actions had made even more vulnerable. Despite the paltry amount of money available I felt that I had to apply, if only because having complained about lack of funding it would show lack of commitment to the cause ðŸ™‚ I duly applied putting forward an application to run a one week crop protection summer school for fifteen students a year for three years. I was successful and last week we ran our first CROPSS Summer School here at Harper Adams University. We particularly targeted first and second year undergraduates doing biology and ecology courses at other universities with little or no agricultural content in their degrees. Our participants came from the universities of Bath, Birmingham, Bristol, Cambridge, Liverpool and Swansea, and apart from one student who came from a farming family, they had no previous experience of agriculture, let alone crop protection. 
 The Summer School started on Sunday afternoon, with an introduction from me about why crop protection was important and how  Integrated Pest Management is all about ecology , NOT spraying and eradication, something I have been banging on about for many years ðŸ™‚ This needs to be reiterated again and again and as loudly as possible. We then had an excellent dinner and I took them all to the bar where I cruelly subjected them to a Pub Quiz, all picture rounds. The first round was all about charismatic megafauna (almost all answered correctly), then dog breeds (about 75% correct), then common British wild flowers (about 60% correct), common British trees (40% correct), common British insects (30% correct), I think you can see where I am going with this ðŸ™‚ 
 The week was divided up between agronomy, entomology, nematology, plant pathology, weed science and spray technology, with a mixture of lectures, field work and laboratory work. In the evening we had guest speakers from the different crop protection sectors, from the agrichemical industry through to government, our last speaker being the Chief Plant Health Officer, Nicola Spence. The external speakers had been asked to explain how they had ended up in their current positions and to talk about careers in those areas. I was very impressed with the willingness of the students to engage with the speakers and the questions they asked were extremely discerning. 
 We were very lucky to be blessed with excellent weather and the Harper Adams University Catering Department came in for very high praise indeed ðŸ™‚ apparently our catering is much better than at the universities represented by our delegates. 
 As the old adage goes, a picture is worth a thousand wordsâ€¦..

 Enjoying the sun and spotting weeds 
 
 Simon Woods from the Engineering Department explaining the fine points of knap sack sprayers 
 
 Andy Cherrill extolling the joys of motorised suction sampling 
 
 Enjoying the bar with one of the guest speakers, Neal Ward 
 All in all, we all had a good time, and if you donâ€™t believe me here are some of the responses from the student feedback 
 
 The students were great, enthusiastic, engaged and we really enjoyed the course and are very much looking forward to seeing a new CROPSS cohort next year. 
 Finally, for those of you interested, here is the timetable of the week:

 Fantastic to hear you made a success of it. I remember looking at STARS when it came out and thinking it sounded like a good idea in principle, but as you pointed out at the time, it was a very large admin investment for a very small grant. Really impressed you seem to have done so well with it, hope it will inspire some of those students to take more applied directions in their later careers. Yes, we also find that incoming students have not been exposed to much/any insect and plant ID (and is it getting more pronounced?) - I don't know whether it's a cultural shift to people spending more time indoors, or something else like curriculum design? Would be excellent to find a way to address this from an earlier stage! (Especially if it means people who aren't at all aiming to become biologists/ecologists nonetheless know a lime tree from a hornbeam!).

 What a great course! So important to have opportunities like this for students to experience applied biology and do a little field work.

 What a great course! People have a tendency to underestimate how effective and important these short courses, but my observation has been that the good ones are remarkably effective at transmitting information and influencing practice. I'm amused that you got a 'tedious' rating from someone, but everyone would recommend the course to others ðŸ™‚
