 Obama gives up. 
 By  Obamarageous  on January 31, 2013 |  Leave a comment 
 Starting his second term with the exact same unemployment rate (7.8%) as the day he started his first term , Obama has given up.  "President Barack Obama will let his jobs council expire this week without renewing its charter." 
 
 Hilariously, the Obama Administration hopes that the American people believe it's 'mission accomplished':  "Officials said the president always intended for the council to fulfill its mission and then wind down."  If true, then Obama's "mission" was to stagnate the U.S. economy.
