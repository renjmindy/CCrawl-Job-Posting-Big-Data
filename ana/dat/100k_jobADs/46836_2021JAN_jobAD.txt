 | As a UW employee, you have a unique opportunity to change lives on our campuses, in our state and around the world. UW employees offer their boundless energy, creative problem solving skills and dedication to build stronger minds and a healthier world. 
 UW faculty and staff also enjoy outstanding benefits, professional growth opportunities and unique resources in an environment noted for diversity, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits and natural beauty. All of which has allowed the UW to be nationally recognized as a “Great College to Work For” for six consecutive years. 
 The Applied Physics Laboratory, University of Washington (APL/UW) is a premier center for research, development and advanced education in science and engineering. APL/UW was formed in 1943 at the request of the U.S. Navy to bring university resources to bear on urgent WWII defense problems. From a wartime beginning focused on effective torpedo exploders, APL/UW initiated acoustic studies and oceanographic research programs to understand how variations in the ocean environment affected the performance of Navy systems. Decades of acoustic and oceanographic studies yielded an understanding of the world's deep oceans. 
 Today our scientists and engineers make important contributions to understanding the earth's climate cycles with satellite and in situ sensing of ocean winds, currents, and air-sea fluxes; observations of Arctic sea ice, its variations and effects on mid-latitude oceans; and ocean tomography that reveals how the abyssal ocean mixes and sequesters carbon. APL-UW continues to lead research in the basic and applied physics of sound—from sonars used to probe the geology of the deep ocean floor to hand-held high-frequency focused ultrasound devices to image and stop internal bleeding without surgery. 
 APL has an outstanding opportunity for a Senior Computer Specialist. 
 The National Science Foundation’s Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) Cabled Array (CA) is an underwater cabled ocean observatory off the Washington and Oregon coasts. It consists of a network of over 900 kilometers of electrical-optical cable that delivers power and bandwidth to deep-water science nodes spread across the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate. This transformational system enables new and exciting science experiments to help explore ocean processes critical to our understanding of the environment.
