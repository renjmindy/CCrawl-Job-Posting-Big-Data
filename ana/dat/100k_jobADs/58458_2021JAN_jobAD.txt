 Clark Howard Leads The Charge 
 Clark Howard is the consumer advocate who took on Bank of America when they refused to help a man who incurred legal charges as a result of B of A calling in the police. They suspected the man was in the middle of a criminal act when he was innocently brought a fraudulent check. For more,  see here  and the post from  yesterday . 
 
 Clark Howard 
 Howard is a nationally syndicated consumer advocate who "advises consumers how to save more, spend less and avoid getting ripped off." He hosts a radio show that is broadcast every day on more than 200 radio stations throughout North America. After a career swinging between jobs in both the public and private sectors, he set up a travel agency business in 1981. Six years later, he retired at the age of 31, having sold what he had developed into a chain that spread across metro Atlanta. 
 A spontaneous guest appearance on a travel show in Florida led to his own program,  The Clark Howard Show , which was soon syndicated by  Dial Global.  In early 2009, The Clark Howard Show was expanded to HLN (formerly the Headline News channel). He is the author of eight books, some of which sat comfortably in the New York Times Bestseller list. While his books are all available through  GetClarkSmart.com , Clark tells his listeners that they are cheaper used and can be had for free at the public library! 
 I think this tells you a lot about the man. I also want you to know that my books are available new and in e-book form on amazon.com, so it shows what kind of man I am. 
 Clark also invests in his native Atlanta community. He started several civic programs, including Atlanta Volunteer Action, Volunteer Action, Inc., The Big Buddy Program and Career Action. Together with listeners, he has helped Habitat for Humanity built 30 homes in and around metro Atlanta. 
 
 Habitat - a great place to volunteer 
 I think in today's economic climate, it is hard to act, hard not to just shut down and weather the storm. If you can do that and live with the clock that's ticking for you, all power to you. For the rest of us, we could do worse than finding a teacher, someone we trust and can follow. This person shouldn't make money out of your actions. Pay him/her for their time, books etc., but not the products or services that they advise you to buy. 
 When learning Tai Chi, I met a man who spent considerable money and time, going to every workshop and studying every form of Tai Chi with every teacher he could find. When we practiced together, his technique was bad. I wondered how someone who learned from so many of the biggest names had failed to grasp the rudiments of the martial art. The answer comes in depth and not breadth. 
 
 Do Little, Achieve Much 
 Jewish proverbs teach us to find a teacher and learn everything we can from them. Only when we have mastered all they have to teach us, should we move on to another teacher. The trick, of course, is finding the right teacher and recognizing that they bring experience and knowledge, but not the gift of foresight. The best thing we can do for ourselves right now is to find the best financial teacher for each of us and then to listen.
