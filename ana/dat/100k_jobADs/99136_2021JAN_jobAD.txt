 Interim Operations Director 
 North Midlands - 6 months 
 Competitive day rate 
 My client, a large ecommerce / utilities business business based in the North Midlands, is looking to recruit an interim Operations Driector as they embark on a major transformation programme across their whole operations function. 
 The successful candidate will be recruited to drive the service and operational efficiency whilst managing the transformation of the customer operations function as a whole and taking ownership of the end to end customer experience including the strategic design and delivery of the customer journey. 
 You will have a proven track record of leading customer teams covering customer sales, retention, complaints as well as insight and analytic teams. You will have strong regulatory experience and will ideally have gained some strong experience in offshoring back office customer functions as my client is looking to go through a major cost transformation as they look to offshore a large proportion of their customer experience team. 
 I expect the role to last for between 6 to 12 months with a view to handing over to a BAU Head of Operations further down the line once the changes to the target operating model have been delivered successfully. 
 Please don't hesitate to get in contact with Mark Freyd to discuss the role in more detail. Or please apply to the role with your up to date CV and I will endeavour to respond to all relevant candidates within 72 hours. 
 My client wants this person to ideally start by the beginning of February at latest but do not rule yourself out of your current role takes you slightly beyond then as they will wait for the right person if need be. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
