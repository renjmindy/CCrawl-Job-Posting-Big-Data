 Are you sick of waiting tables, bartending and/or temping? 
 I get it. 
 These  day   jobs  can  take a toll on your mind and body  and while bringing in an income, the often  long, exhausting hours  (over several years) can rob you from time and energy you'd rather spend on your main hustle- the acting career! 
 What if there was an  ACTING DAY JOB  that could pay all your bills? 
 ​Well, I know of one... 
 **Check out MY favorite ACTOR DAY JOB in the video below!  ** 
 
 ​So now you know :)
