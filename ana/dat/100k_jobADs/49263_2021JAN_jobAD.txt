 How To Successfully Find Jobs During COVID-19 
     J.T. O'Donnell 
 and 
     Work It Daily 
 April 13, 2020 
 The Work It Daily Team has gotten a lot of questions regarding COVID-19 and job search lately. These questions include, "are jobs still hiring during the coronavirus outbreak?" and "is it even worth me looking for a job right now?" 
 
 While it may be harder to find a job right now, it's not impossible. In this episode, J.T. O'Donnell dives into how to properly job search during COVID-19 and how you can set yourself apart from other candidates. 
 One of the most important things you should be thinking about right now, if you've been laid off or furloughed or even if you feel like you may be, is a strategy around what you can do in that time where there aren't going to be as many job opportunities.
