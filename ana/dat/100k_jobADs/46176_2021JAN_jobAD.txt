  3 Things You DON'T Think About During Job Interviews (But Should)

 Job interviews are typically your first chance to present your whole self to a company, so you want to put your best foot forward. It's time to impress your future employer with your experience and personality! In addition to having great responses to the interviewer's questions and dressing to the nines, you need to think about... 
 
 
 1. Your "Likability" Factor 
 People want to hire people they like and think they could work with, for obvious reasons. So, your likability level is a HUGE factor in the job interview/hiring process. 
 Employers want to know you'll fit in with their "tribe" of employees.  They don't want to throw off their company culture by hiring someone who's not a good fit. 
 Take steps to build rapport with your interviewer and meet people within the company. You'll stand out in the hiring process even before you go in for an interview if you've already  connected with a few employees on LinkedIn . 
 2. Your Ability To Communicate Thoughts Effectively 
 When answering interview questions, it's important to communicate your thoughts clearly and confidently. Otherwise, you risk sounding unprepared or unconfident. 
 During job interviews, be concise and convey confidence when you speak.  This is especially important when  answering behavioral interview questions . 
 Remember, though, you want to come across as self-assured and humble, not overconfident and cocky. The best way to do this is by following the "Experience + Learn = Grow" model. Learning how to answer interview questions with this framework will help you effectively communicate why you're a great fit for the position, both in terms of experience and personality. 
 3. Your Body Language 
 Communication isn't limited to speech. You need to be aware of your body language, too. If you're fidgeting, swiveling in your chair, slouching, or not making eye contact with your interviewer, it can make you seem unconfident and even untrustworthy. 
 Doing a  mock interview  with a trusted colleague is a good way to practice your answers to interview questions and perfect your body language.  Are you sitting up straight? Are you making enough eye contact? 
 Your mock interviewer can give you feedback on what to work on, so your body language doesn't send the wrong message on the big day.
