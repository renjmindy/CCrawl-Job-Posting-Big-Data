 ROAD TRANSPORT JOBS 
 ​OVERVIEW: 
 Road transport jobs are mostly driving roles, with a wide range of vehicles being used to move people and freight. There are a broad range of roles for this job sector, ranging from drivers of buses, taxis and trucks to more specific roles within different industries. For example, employment as a car driver of individual passengers and small groups could include roles such as a limousine chauffeur, taxi driver or new entrants into the driving market such as Uber drivers. These roles can be performed as an employee or as a self-employed owner driver. 
 CURRENT VACANCIES 
 PROSPECTS FOR ROAD TRANSPORT JOBS: 
 Across Australia, there are roughly  230,000 drivers  employed in the road transport industry, in the categories of passenger car drivers, bus drivers, delivery van drivers and truck drivers. In November 2016, the  Department of Employment  reported over 2,600 vacancies for the month in the job market for these drivers, with overall vacancies for the last 12 months at more than 28,000 (for 2016). 
 There is a continuing and strong demand for drivers particularly in the delivery of goods and freight, fueled by increasing consumer participation in online shopping and a demand for services such as fast food delivery. Generally, the number of vacancies is highest for truck drivers where approximately 70% of the jobs and vacancies in the road transport industry have been in 2016.. 
 For the future years up to 2020 the Department of Employment has forecast growth in job vacancies as being: 
 
 
 Slight for bus and coach drivers 
 
 
 Moderate for truck drivers 
 
 
 Strong for passenger car drivers 
 
 
 Very strong for delivery drivers 
 
 
 Truck divers, passenger car drivers and delivery drivers are areas where job seekers looking for a driving role have a strong chance of success.

 QUALIFICATIONS FOR ROAD TRANSPORT JOBS: 
 Driving Licenses 
 While some employers want certificate level qualifications, the most important qualification is the attainment of the relevant State driving licence. For example in NSW relevant licence classes are: 
 
 
 C for Cars – for vehicles up to 4.5 tonnes and seating up to 12 adults 
 
 
 Light Rigid, Medium Rigid and Heavy Rigid that cover differing size and weights of trucks or buses 
 
 
 Heavy and Multi Combination covering the largest vehicles including prime movers and road trains 
 
 
 Other Driving Permits 
 In addition to a driving licence, drivers may have to obtain other authorisations. In New South Wales, for example, the following categories of drivers have to obtain special permits: 
 
 
 All drivers carrying public passengers – must obtain a Public Passenger Vehicle Driver Authority 
 
 
 Taxi Drivers – must obtain a Taxi Driver Authority 
 
 
 Tow Truck Drivers – must obtain a tow truck operators licence 
 
 
 Certification/Training Requirements 
 In order to get the necessary licences and permits, certain classes of drivers may have to undergo formal training. 
 Drivers requiring a heavy vehicle licence (trucks and buses) need to complete an assessment for Heavy Vehicle Competency conducted by a Registered Training Organisation in some states (this is a specific NSW requirement - other States have their own training requirements) 
 Other Certificates that may be required for vehicle drivers include: 
 
 
 Certificate II in Driving Operations (Passenger Car Drivers) 
 
 
 Certificate III in Driving Operations (Bus and Truck Drivers) 
 
 
 Certificate IV in Driving Operations (Truck Drivers) 
 
 
 The Department of Education and Training details  training and certification requirements  along with specific units unique to different driving jobs. Workpac Group provides  Gold Training courses  for a range of accredited and non-accredited training. If a specific course of training is not listed at Gold Training then the Department of Education and Training maintains a  register of training providers .
