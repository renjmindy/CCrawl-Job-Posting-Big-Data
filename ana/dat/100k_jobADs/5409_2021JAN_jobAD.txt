  The Surprising Key To The Hidden Job Market  
 Work It Daily 
 February 09, 2014 
 There are plenty of jobs in the hidden job market, but without the right strategy, you won't be able to tap into its potential. Learning one surprising thing about that market's attitude can save you weeks of wasted time, and more importantly, get you a job you are the perfect fit for! (The secret is in the above video from one of our Career Q&A sessions.)  You're unique, but you're not special.  Those two words go hand-in-hand sometimes, but they don't always correlate. There's a very competitive job market currently, so you're not special in employers' eyes. However, no one has the exact same experience you do, which means your skills may be perfectly tailored to solve their problems. 
 
 How To Build A Unique Personal Brand 
 Once you find the right organization, you can reach out to them and build a more unique brand.  Get very specific  with your career research. That may seem counter-intuitive, but it's the best way to find the right situation for yourself. If you cast too wide a net, you'll never be able to prove you're a significantly better choice than many other candidates, because you won't be able to invest as much time into each company. Since having a giving mindset is so important to professional relationships, it's no surprise that the same applies for companies. Take the time to get to know people and their needs, because the only reason they would hire you is if you can fill those needs anyway.  Find 10 people  in the space that are doing something you want to do, meet them and ask how they got there. If you earn that group's trust person by person, you'll be well on your way to a reputation as someone with a clear purpose in the job market. It's not easy to get a hold of that many people in a given industry, but once you have their attention, you can show the value you would bring to them - regardless of whether or not you work for them in the future. Don't spam them by asking for a job. Instead, ask what they would suggest for someone entering their field. While you learn what those tips are, you can mention some of the things you've done, your skills, and other things that would show you're a smart person working hard to accomplish your goal. 
 Next... Keep The Relationships Going And Reap The Benefits 
 After you've discovered and befriended a tight group within your target field, those individuals will start noticing positions that you would be the best choice for. Make sure you still keep in touch with them somewhat regularly though. Good working relationships require your time and effort. There are a TON of opportunities like that, usually when a job hasn't even been posted. CAREEREALISM founder, J.T. O'Donnell as experienced, companies will wait for the right candidate. After you've put in hard work with the people closest to your situation, that will hopefully be you! We may not all be special, but that's because we ALL have the ability to make an impact in our respective careers. If you enhance and emphasize what makes you unique during your professional life, you'll achieve something special: having a job you love and are great at.  Enjoy this article?
