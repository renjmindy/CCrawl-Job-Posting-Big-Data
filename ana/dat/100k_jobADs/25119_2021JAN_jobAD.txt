 WAREHOUSING, STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION JOBS 
 ​ 
 OVERVIEW: 
 Warehousing, storage and distribution jobs are available in the manufacturing and transport and logistics industries. Staff are employed to load and unload goods from trucks for transportation and storage. They operate machinery such as forklifts, hydraulic pallet lifters and conveyor belts for moving heavy goods. In addition to receiving and dispatching goods, workers fill orders in the warehouse and keep inventories of stock. 
 Supervisors and managers in the transport and logistics industry oversee warehousing staff, ensuring that goods are received and stored properly. They are responsible for confirming that orders are correctly labelled and packed for delivery. Managers and supervisors plan delivery routes, allocate storage space for maximum efficiency and monitor stock levels in warehouses. They forecast labour demands and handle OH&S matters.

 PROSPECTS FOR MANUFACTURING, STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION JOBS: 
 Warehouses are used by importers, exporters, wholesalers and manufacturers for the storage of perishable goods and mass-produced items. Prospects for warehousing and storage and distribution jobs are strong due to the wide range of products that need to be stored and transported. 
 The transport and logistics industry impacts on every area of the economy. It facilitates a high standard of living for Australians by delivering the food and manufactured products essential for modern life. The industry generates employment in many areas, particularly warehousing which is integral to the storage and movement of goods. 
 According to the Australian government’s  Job Outlook  website, employment prospects for storepersons rose substantially over the past 10 years. There were 124, 000 people employed as storepersons in November 2015, making this a major area of employment. 
 This statistic indicate that demand for warehousing jobs is likely to remain strong in most regions in Australia up to 2020 and beyond. Other related jobs are also expected to have steady employment prospects over the next five years.
