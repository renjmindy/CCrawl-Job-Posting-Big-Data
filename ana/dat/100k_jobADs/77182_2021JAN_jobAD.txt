 Tag: getting a job 
 “We don’t understand that life is heaven, for we have only to understand that and it will at once be fulfilled in all its beauty, we shall embrace each other and weep.” ~ Fyodor Dostoevsky

 “We work in the dark—we do what we can—we give what we have. Our doubt is our passion, and our passion is our task. The rest is the madness of art.” ~  Henry James 
 Dried Fishing Boat at Udaipur Sea Beach in West Bengal 
 Well, Corey finally got a telephone call from the security people. He goes in tonight to fill out his paper work and to attend an orientation. It's so funny because not even an hour ago, he was bemoaning the fact that he hadn't received a phone call yet, and it was really worrying him. Now he is worried about going to work. As he puts it, he hasn't worked in so long that he has no idea what to expect. I told him that I was certain he would be fine. 
 The company representative reiterated that they think that Corey is overqualified for this particular position, and that they will not hold it against him if he finds a better job. He said that Corey should look on this as a stepping stone. 
 I am so happy for him. I have a feeling that once he begins working, everything will fall into place. For now, I will have to drive Corey to work on those days that conflict with Brett's school schedule or other appointments, but it will be so worth it. 
 “If there were a little more silence, if we all kept quiet . . . maybe we could understand something.” ~  Frederico Fellini 
 Abandoned Fishing Boat, Threipmuir, Edinburgh, Scotland 
 More very strange dreams last night, very intricate. I do remember that I was doing a lot of walking to and from place to place and that I felt really good about myself for doing so much walking. Must have something to do with the fact that I planned to start walking today, but of course, I awoke to rain. 
 In parts of my dream, my father was going to divorce my mother; someone killed chickens in the kitchen; a man and woman moved into the townhouse next door to mine and tried to take my family and me captive; the boys were very young again; Corey and I decided to just pack what we really wanted and to leave everything else behind so that we could start over, and I was packing backpacks for all of us. 
 Why does the mind work in the way that it does during dreams? Whenever my father comes to me in dreams, it is almost always in some kind of bizarre form with a little bit of truth behind it. I understand that dreaming about my sons' younger versions is my own sense of wishing that they were younger and still needed me as they did then, but why do I always dream about conflict? 
 I heard somewhere that every person in your dreams actually represents yourself. I don't really think that is true because so many people in my dreams act in ways that are totally alien to me. 
 "Happiness is not a matter of intensity but of balance, order, rhythm and harmony." ~  Thomas Merton 
 The family got together on Sunday for lunch to celebrate the three birthdays. Alexis planned everything. It was very nice, and even my mother seemed to enjoy herself—such a rarity. My s-i-l Ann and I decided that we are quite content to pass the baton for planning family gatherings to Alexis since she seems to have such a knack for it. We haven't informed her of this yet. I'm sure she will be pleased . . . not. 
 Old Boat Returning to Nature 
 For some very strange reason, I have been craving lobster. Now if you knew me, you would know what an aberration this is. I don't believe in eating lobsters as they can live to be incredibly old if left alone. I think that there is something very elegant about these creatures that live in the bottom of the sea, just meandering along, bothering no one. In fact, I make it well nigh impossible for anyone who is dining on lobster to enjoy their meal as I put my fingers together and say "Help me" in a squeaky voice. 
 So bearing that in mind, why would I be craving something I don't believe in eating? This, too, makes no sense to me. It would be akin to my craving lamb or veal, neither of which I will eat. Is this my own version of pica, that eating disorder that occurs in very young children in which they eat non-nutrive substances for no apparent reason? Geez. 
 "Do you find coming to terms with the mindless tedium of it all presents an interesting challenge?" ~  Douglas Adams, The Hitcher 's Guide to the Galaxy 
 Old Boat on Càrna Overlooking Caol Chàrna, Scotland 
 My word for the day is tedium, from the Latin taedium, which means irksomeness. I mean, that is what most days are, really. The tedium, the unending parade of washing machine commercials, telephone calls that result in no forward progress, mail from companies wanting more and more when there is less and less, the stream of cars lined up at stop lights, each individual wrapped up in his or her own world, just waiting for the light to turn green. 
 Life being dealt out in seconds and minutes of rushing to where exactly? Our own mortality? People going to jobs they hate but saying nothing because having any job is better than no job. Mothers and fathers waiting after school for their children to be released from school only to spend the next two to three hours shuffling them from one extra-curricular activity to another, but is there any interaction going on in the car, the minivan, the SUV between parent and child while on the way to somewhere? 
 The cacophony of reality television in which the people being shown are doing anything but leading real lives. Shows about fat people, famous people, people with huge families, people who are famous because they are famous, people whose vices are held up as virtues because they can win the island, people who wear seven-carat diamond rings and bemoan their inability to have real friendships, people who are hoarders, addicts, moguls, and more.

 And then there is me: putting my life on this page for anyone to see. Sharing intimate moments, triumphs and failures. Writing about life, love, loss, and nothing at all. Castigating politicians and talking heads. Caressing words as if they hold all of the power. But they do hold all of the power. Words. Words that pass on knowledge. Words that wound. Words that awaken the soul to beauty. Words that weave stories and morality tales and dreams. Words that are hollow and hard. Words that are sour and somber. 
 Sometimes, it is all so tedious, this life. One long line of  I want  , and  I don 't have , and  Why me  , and  What will happen ? Mortgage restructuring, debt consolidation, loans and repayments. This is civilization and all of its entanglements. Pity the poor fool who yearns for this rough and tumble existence over what she already has. 
 Tedium. Thoroughly tiresome. Bone-shakingly, soul-achingly stultifying. The alternative? Silence and nothingness. 
 More later.  Peace .

 Welcome. Here you will find posts on just about anything, from the mundane to the insane, the outlandish to the sublime. I include a wide selection of quotes, images and music in most of my posts. If I am unable to present new content, I rely on that old favorite—the reblog. Be forewarned: I am a left-leaning, liberal, feminist who does not hesitate to speak my mind. Enjoy. 
 (Not much other social media for me except for my tumblr, Frenzy and Lightning, which you can visit  here  or below.) And you can find my various product reviews on Influenster  here .
