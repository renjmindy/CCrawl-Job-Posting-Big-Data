  9 Resolution Ideas for Your Career in 2010  
 Work It Daily 
 January 01, 2010 
 By CAREEREALISM-Approved Expert ,  Andy Robinson  We're swinging into the end of another year;  it's a great time to think about what you'll do different or do better next year . In addition to your work goals, personal goals and family goals,  consider the following "New Years Resolution" ideas  - all of which should complement all of your 2010 goals.  Commit to Your Learning and Personal Development This Year  Make this the year you rededicate yourself to your own learning and personal development. Those who make learning and professional development a priority will create significant competitive advantage for themselves, which in the current job market and economic times, has never been more important. Reading and listening to audio tapes is THE easiest way to gain knowledge and new information.  Re-Connect With and Nurture Your Contact Network  Your network of business, professional and personal contacts is the most valuable and transportable asset you have...period. A properly nourished and up-to-date network can truly work wonders for your career. Make a commitment now to reconnect with your contact network and look for ways to "give" and add-value to others. Build your bank of goodwill now so there is plenty available when you need it.  Make Your Health and Fitness a Top Priority  Your health and fitness has four dimensions: (1) Diet and general weight control - achieved through healthy eating habits, (2) Cardiovascular health - achieved through regular cardio and aerobic exercise/activity, (3) Strong bones and optimal muscle mass - achieved through weight/strength training, and (4) Flexibility - achieved through stretching, yoga, pilates, etc. Set goals associated with all of these elements and incorporate weekly activities designed to help you achieve those goals.  Commit to Focusing on the Positive  Make this the year you give relentless focus on the positive without dwelling on the negative. Become a role model for a positive mindset - avoid being overly critical of others, avoid gossip, and discourage complaining.  Commit to Getting Organized - At the Office and at Home  Begin the year by getting rid of the clutter. Commit yourself to organizing your work space and home before the end of January. Make it a team or family effort.  Say "Thank You" More Often  Saying "thank you" does as much or more for you than it does for the other person. Saying "thank you" or writing a quick note of appreciation has the physical and emotional effect of "shot" positive energy. It does the same for the person receiving the message. Give this gift to yourself on a daily basis.  Recognize the Performance of Others  Celebrate the achievement of others whenever possible. Recognize the extra effort and positive performance of others - your team members, your colleagues, your friends and your family. LOOK for good things and you'll be amazed at how many good things you see.  Get Your Personal Finances Under Control  This is definitely the time for us to hunker down, reign in our spending habits, work within the framework of a budgeting system and make every effort possible to set aside as much as we can for the future. Financial control and discipline is an excellent personal and professional development opportunity right now - become an expert in these philosophies and methodologies and it will pay huge rewards for you in the long term.  Write Down Your Business and Personal Goals - Review Them Weekly  Write down all of your business and personal goals. Formulate them in "SMART" goal format, and for each goal, clearly identify your very next step. Schedule those steps into your planning tool(s) - your calendar, your "to do" list, etc. Review your goals weekly and update next steps accordingly.
