 Sustained Funding Needed For Training To Meet State's Skilled Labor Needs 
 The Workforce Competitiveness Trust Fund delivers the best bang for the State's buck, so let's fund it!

 According to a  recent survey ,  two thirds   of employers  in Massachusetts have trouble finding workers with the right skills. That’s not surprising when you consider that  one in three   adults  in our state have only a high school diploma or less. Not to mention, nearly  one third  of the state's labor force is  over the age of 55  and will be retiring soon. These are among the realities that combine to create a  perfect storm , threatening the stability our statewide economy. 
 The good news  is that Massachusetts has  two  funding mechanisms to help address these issues: the  Workforce Training Fund  (WTF), a   $22M fund  supported by employer-backed contributions from Unemployment Insurance for incumbent worker training, and the  Workforce Competitiveness Trust Fund  (WCTF),  a  proven  sector-based training model that has served hundreds of employers with qualified talent.  The bad news:  funding for both has  decreased over the years , and  only one of these has a sustained annual funding stream.

 Breaking the Cycle of Poverty Through Job Training and Financial Literacy 
 What does it mean to be economically self-sufficient? To be financially stable? Many of us hear those terms, or something similar, and learn of their importance starting from an early age and may even get some exposure to tools and tips from family, teachers or mentors, but  studies show  that  nearly 70%  of Americans are not financially literate. So we’re talking about a LOT of people who  aren’t getting the financial literacy knowledge  they need to understand or manage their finances.
