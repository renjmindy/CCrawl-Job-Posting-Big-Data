 Obey God 
 Jesus has things he wants us to do. He gives us instructions. 
 Do we do it exactly like He says? Or do we attempt to do it "in the spirit" of what He meant? 
 Well, we tell ourselves and others, He didn't really mean it that way. Or, that was just for his disciples then, it doesn't apply to us today. 
 Really? That is our approach to our Master. Rationalizing away what Jesus wants puts on the wrong side of God. God has given all authority to Jesus. God's goal for us that we obey Him. God is God. He is not to be questioned. 
 Do effective employees "kind of do" what their boss wants them to do? Not if they want to keep their jobs. 
 I want to keep my job with Jesus. 
 
 The disciples went and did exactly what Jesus told them to do. ~~Matthew 21:6

 What is worry? Do we know God? Do we know how God works? 
 
   
 
 What is the proper response to God as His covenant people? Is it faithfulness?

 Will we regret it if we make a run for God? 
 What is the proper response to God as His covenant people? Is it faithfulness? 
 What is worry? Do we know God? Do we know how God works? 
 Do we understand love? Do we really get it? 
 What price did Jesus pay to redeem us? 
 Are there examples where Jesus didn't judge? 
 Can a gaabout gossip be trusted? Will someone of integrity violate a confidence? 
 Will we be resurrected? 
 Are we slaves or servants? What does Jesus think? 
 Why does Jesus ask so many questions? What are your answers?
