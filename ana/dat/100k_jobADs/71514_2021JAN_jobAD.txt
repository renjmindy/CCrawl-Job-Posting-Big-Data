 Article on careers in big data 
 Posted on  11/12/2012  by  hoffalex 
 **Here’s an interesting article from the New York Times about jobs in big data. 
 http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/sunday-review/big-datas-impact-in-the-world.html?pagewanted=all 
 This article describes the stories of two people whose careers involve big data analytics. One Mo Zhou was a Yale MBA who was recently hired as a data consultant by IBM and now helps “make sense of an explosion of data — Web traffic and social network comments, as well as software and sensors that monitor shipments, suppliers and customers — to guide decisions, trim costs and lift sales.”. Their other example was Justin Grimmer, a 28 year old assistant professor at Stanford who combined Math and Political science in his undergraduate and graduate studies in order to, in his words, sees “an opportunity because the discipline is becoming increasingly data-intensive.”. It is certainly interesting to see how yet another example of one of the myriad ways that big data is beginning to become a valuable asset for a variety of careers, both in business and academia. There seems to be a large and increasing demand for jobs involving big data analytics. As the article describes, according to a study by the McKinsey Global Institute, the United States needs 140,000 to 190,000 more workers with “deep analytical” expertise and 1.5 million more data-literate managers. It will certainly be interesting to see if this demand becomes easily sated or continues to grow over time. Either way, however, it appears that big data analytics are about to become more ubiquitous throughout both the business world and the world of academia.**
