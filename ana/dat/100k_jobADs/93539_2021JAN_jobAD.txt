 Heroku + Shopify + Api 
 Published: 3 months ago  Deadline: 1 Bids: 6 
 I hired a freelancer previously and he developed an app that connects via API a warehouse system with Shopify. Unfortunately, we were able to install the app only on a test store but not on the production one. 
 My wish: 
 I give you the code and the access to Heroku (where it is currently deployed). You analyze the problem and make the app run finally. 
 If you have experience with Heroku + Shopify + API you should make it hours.
