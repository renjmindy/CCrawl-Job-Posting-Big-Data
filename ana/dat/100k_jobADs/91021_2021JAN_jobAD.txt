 15 Sep Physically Demanding Jobs Can Lead to Knee Problems Later in Life—Here’s How to Deal

 Your knees are the largest joint in your body, and they’re in charge of so many of your movements. And new research suggests that those who perform physically demanding jobs are more prone to developing osteoarthritis in the knees—which proves that taking care of the knee joint health is essential to longevity. The finding, which was published in _ Arthritis Care and Research , _came from a review of 71 studies that looked at over 951,000 participants, some of which had more sedentary occupations while others had active ones (jobs that involve lots of kneeling, standing, walking, and heavy lifting). Those who worked in physically demanding jobs were 52 percent more likely to develop knee osteoarthritis than those who weren’t as active in their jobs. 
 With any kind of osteoarthritis, you’re dealing with inflammation of a bone and joint capsule. Your joints are protected by cartilage, which acts as a sort of shock absorber. It naturally breaks down as you age and through movement, which is when your joints begin to connect to one another, which can result in pain. There’s a difference between exercising and moving throughout your entire workday that explains the osteoarthritis risk.  Exercise stimulates the production of collagen , which is an important component of cartilage. But if you move over a prolonged period of time, not doing a specific exercise, that cartilage just breaks down over time. Exercise produces new cells that can repair damaged muscle tissue and keep your body running a little more efficiently while being physical in your job puts a lot of wear and tear on the body. 
 Since this kind of physical activity—from standing to walking and kneeling—is simply a standard in so many occupations, it’s incredibly important to take care of your knee joint. It's crucial to take good care of it so that your knees can last a lifetime. If you don’t pay attention to them, cartilage will progressively (and sometimes aggressively) break down. 
 How to maintain and improve your knee joint health 
 1. Strength training  : Do two to three strength-training sessions a week that feature exercises for the glutes and core. This ensures that your surrounding muscles are strong and can help absorb impact. 
 2. Wear proper footwear:  Your footwear plays a big role in your knee health. Wear orthotics when needed or make sure that if you’re on your feet all day, you have enough support in your shoes. 
 3. Work on your circulation:  Blood flow is crucial for the health of your joints. Percussion massage therapy (with a  Hypervolt  or  Theragun ), cupping, or compression can help achieve this. 
 4. Stretching:  Stretching is important for any active regimen, but it also plays a role in your joint health. Dr. Beauchamp says that hip and leg stretching in particular can help with your knees. 
 5. Nutrition:  What you put on your plate can also lead to healthier, stronger joints.  Studies  have found that vitamin K and omega-3 fats are especially important for a bone-healthy diet. Also, experts suggest lowering your consumption of inflammatory foods (such as sugar, processed food, and dairy).
