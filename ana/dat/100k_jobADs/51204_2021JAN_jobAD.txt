  Debt With Job I Like, or Save Money In Job I Hate?  
 Work It Daily 
 August 12, 2009 
 Dear Experts, I've been in my new job for 3 months. I like the work, but the pay is really low. A couple of times, I've had to use my credit card to pay bills and I'm worried I'm falling into debt. I just heard about another job that pays a lot more. My friend works there and can get me an interview. However, the work doesn't sound as exciting - in fact, in sounds pretty terrible. But, it would give me enough money to live. Should I try to get the job so I don't keep going into debt? My friend says it's pretty easy to get hired.  Here is how our T.A.P. experts answered this question:   Q#244  Mobilize active search for position you'd enjoy/pays more. Path of least resistance/easy job not a winner. ( @keppie_careers )  Q#244  Don't perpetuate debt. Interview for job 2 get facts 1st-hand; continue job-search/networking. ( @ValueIntoWords )  Q#244  Just wanted to agree with  @jtodonnell  100%. ( @heatherhuhman )  Q#244  Keep job & find PT job to avoid debt. DON'T take job you don't like. You'll regret it & won't last. ( @jtodonnell )  Q#244  I would try a different approach and try cutting your expenses to stay in the job you like. Working a bad job is no fun. ( @gradversity )  Q#244  Avoid taking a job just 4 money since u are already working. Better 2 talk 2 curr employer abt oppt instead. ( @kgrantcareers )  Q#244  Talk w/ current boss abt situation. Cld u do PT at current job & PT at higher paying job (that u also like)? ( @sweetcareers )  Q#244  Work u hate can kill spirit; Y choose it? U'll end up lvg or b in misery. Any more $ poss where u r? ( @juliaerickson )  Q#244  Never work in a job you hate only for the money. Short-term is okay, but not worth it in long run.
