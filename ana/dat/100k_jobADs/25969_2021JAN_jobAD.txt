 Remote Job Search Assistance Service 
 The remote job market is extremely competitive and looking for open positions can be a very overwhelming experience. Even frustrating if you are submitting resumes and not hearing back from employers about your applications. But it shouldn't be this way because everyday more companies are embracing remote work within their organizations opening up new opportunities to get a job that allows you to work from anywhere in the world. 
 What does it take to get a remote job? 
 
 You have the right mindset and skills to work remotely. 
 You have a  powerful resume  that makes a good first impression and showcases your professional strengths. 
 You apply for remote jobs that match your profile. For instance, some employers might have specific needs in terms of your immigration or citizenship situation, the languages you speak and your portfolio. 
 You perform research on the company (mission, values, products, services) before you head in for a job interview and carefully review the job description to understand why you would be a good fit. 
 You project self-confidence in the job interview. 
 
 How does it work? 
 Let us scan the most popular remote job boards for you! 
 You will receive 4-6 current job openings that match your specific requirements and skills within 3 days of purchase.
