 We Are  ** ** 
 Breaking The Law 
 LawAdvisor was founded in 2015 in Melbourne, Australia with a fearless and ambitious belief:  that everybody should have access to justice. 
 We hypothesised that the high costs, inefficiencies, and difficulties of obtaining legal help could be overcome simply by providing greater access to legal information, and by providing everybody with real-time access to high-quality, affordable lawyers online. 
 Our mission has since been supported by thousands of lawyers and has allowed us to expand and set up offices across the globe.  We've also attracted high profile investors and partners who have shared our mission to transform legal service delivery. 
 We're still not satisfied. The potential exists to completely revolutionise the  practice  of law. The start of this decade has delivered LawAdvisor with a new mandate: to overhaul and transform how lawyers work, and how people interact with and consume legal services, with state of the art legal practise management technology to (i) increase efficiencies; (ii) automate routine processes; (iii) increase transparency; and (iv) bring legal practice to the 21st century. 
 **We Need ‚Ä¶ ** 
 _A Novice Juggler  _ 
 Our Associate Product Manager relishes in the idea being a part of a team that moves mountains. They know better than to falter when opportunities aren't handed to them because they know that nothing good will ever come easy. Remaining steadfast and diligent, they're prepared to get their hands dirty and navigate through the variety of tasks that they'll take ownership over. 
 Teaming up with our Product Managers, you'll solve problems and facilitate communication across our cross-functional team and align them in order to shape, influence, and refine our products. An intimate understanding of our market and product suite helps us surmount any obstacle facing us whether it may be competitors, client and stakeholder feedback, or the creation of new products and features. You'll be ready to learn from the best and continuously supercharge your professional growth and knowledge through our resources, tools, and first-hand experience.

 A Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, Business Management, Marketing, a similar related field or equivalent practical experience.
