 Are you looking to join one of the Midlands biggest FMCG brands? 
 I am currently recruiting new Supply Chain Manager positions to work within their logistics service delivery team ensuring their supplier network and products are all working to the highest quality. 
 The company is striving to provide a "best in class" supply chain offering to their end consumers, you will be asked to regularly meet with supplier partners to understand better what drives consumer choice in this area. You will need to proactively investigate what works best in different areas of the supply chain and why, the role has the full support of an onsite Supply Chain Director. 
 The Supply Chain Manager will be accountable for managing supplier partner relationships, auditing service performance, ensuring the highest standards are met, providing analysis and recommending remedial actions as required. You will work with your team of Supply Chain Analysts to proactively help your employer and suppliers to analyse areas for improvement and take actions to ensure all company KPIs are met. 
 The Supply Chain Manager roles will be office based with a focus on specific areas of their Supply Chain network e.g. e-commerce or general FMCG distribution. The role would suit a candidate who has previously worked for a 3PL/distribution company as part of a Graduate Scheme looking to now push on with their career in a corporate based structured environment 
 To be successful in the role you will need to demonstrate that you are a self-starter with an ability to think outside of the box. Preferably your background will come from either an e-commerce or a food/FMCG distribution environment. The role will be very analytical so the ability to be "into the numbers" will be essential… 
 The successful Supply Chain Manager will receive a competitive basic salary with potential for salary reviews against performance, like any growing business my client is able to support ongoing career development. 
 If the role sounds are of interest to you then please contact Phil Birch for more information. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
