 The Regional Growth Plan is an economic strategy to grow the greater Wichita region’s economy, attract new businesses, and expand existing industries. 
 This multi-year actionable plan features seven target industry sectors, 32 key initiatives and a regional framework to support implementation. The plan takes into account the previous plan, the Blueprint for Regional Economic Growth, and builds upon its research and foundation. In 2018, regional stakeholders spent ten months drilling down into market information, analyzing research, and diving deep into community input to identify focused strategies to grow the economy. The final plan was completed in late 2018 and regional partners are currently working together to see the plan implemented. More information about the plan can be found at  bit.ly/RegionalGrowthPlan
