 Criminal: Iain Duncan Smith has made the UK government into a criminal regime, illegally victimising its most vulnerable citizens. 
 Iain Duncan Smith took an metaphorical slap in the face from the High Court today when Mrs Justice Lang said his retroactive law to refuse docked payments to jobseekers was not legal. 
 The Jobseekers (Back to Work Schemes) Act 2013 was rushed onto the statute books after the DWP discovered the rules under which it had docked Jobseekers' Allowance from 228,000 people, who had refused to take part in Workfare schemes, were illegal. 
 The ruling does  not  mean that everyone who was penalised for refusing to take part, or for leaving the scheme once they had started it and realised what it was, may claim back the JSA that had been withdrawn from them. 
 But anyone who appealed against a benefit sanction on the basis of the previous decision will be entitled to win their appeals and be repaid the withheld benefits -  as  Vox Political  advised at the time .  That payout could be as high as £130 million. 
 The judge said retrospective application of the 2013 law conflicted with the European Convention on Human Rights and "interfered with the right to a fair trial" of all those affected. 
 (This is, of course, one reason why  the government wants to repeal the Human Rights Act  - your human rights obstruct ministers' ability to abuse you.) 
 This is the latest twist in  a legal challenge brought by Cait Reilly , a graduate who fell foul of the scheme, in 2012. She demanded a judicial review on the grounds that being forced to give up voluntary work in a museum (she wanted to be a museum curator) to stack shelves in Poundland breached her human rights. 
 Poundland no longer takes part in mandatory work activity schemes run by the UK government. 
 Her challenge succeeded when  the Court of Appeal ruled that she had not been properly notified about the scheme . This meant that  the government was guilty of criminal acts  in removing benefit from Ms Reilly and hundreds of thousands of others. 
 In response, the Coalition passed an Act that retrospectively legalised its actions - but claimants argued that this was unfair and demanded their compensation. 
 In the meantime,  Iain Duncan Smith's own appeal was heard - and dismissed  - by the Supreme Court. 
 And after the Act was passed, it became clear that the Coalition had known since 2011 that  the policies it was enforcing do more harm than good and are not in the national interest . 
 Mrs Justice Lang said today (July 4) that “the absence of any consultation with representative organisations” as well as the lack of scrutiny by Parliamentary committees had led to “misconceptions about the legal justification for the retrospective legislation”. 
 The 2013 Act introduced a new “draconian provision, unique to this cohort of claimants” which was “not explained or justified” by the government in Parliament “at the time”. 
 Mrs Justice Lang rejected the Secretary of State’s assertion that flaws in the 2011 Regulations were simply “a technicality or a loophole”, that the 2013 Act sought to give effect to Parliament’s ‘original intention’ or that repayments to benefits claimants would be “an undeserved windfall”. 
 She also recognised that it would be “unjust to categorise the claimants in the Cait Reilly case as claimants “who have not engaged with attempts made by the state to return them to work”, as asserted by the Department for Work and Pensions. 
 "This case is another massive blow to this Government’s flawed and tawdry attempts to make poor people on benefits work for companies, who already make massive profits, for free," said solicitor Phil Shiner of Public Interest Lawyers, who appeared for the unemployed. 
 "Last year the Supreme Court told Iain Duncan Smith and the Coalition government that the scheme was unlawful. In this case the High Court has now told the Government that the attempt to introduce retrospective legislation, after the DWP had lost in the Court of Appeal, is unlawful and a breach of the Human Rights Act and  is a further disgraceful example of how far this Government is prepared to go to flout our constitution and the rule of law . [bolding mine] 
 "I call on the DWP to ensure that the £130 million of benefits unlawfully withheld from the poorest section of our society is now repaid." 
 So there it is, in black and white.  Iain Duncan Smith has made the Coalition government a criminal organisation, guilty of 228,000 human rights violations. 
 This is a serious matter; some of these people may have been put in serious financial hardship as a result of the Coalition's actions. One hopes very much that nobody died but if they did, those fatalities should be added to the many thousands who have passed away as a result of Iain Duncan Smith's homicidal regime for claimants of incapacity benefits. 
 Let us not forget, also, that we remain at the mercy of these tyrants. Iain Duncan Smith has announced he intends to waste yet more taxpayers' money on another appeal. In the meantime,  a DWP spokeswoman said  the legislation remained "in force" and the government would not be compensating anyone pending the outcome of its appeal.

 Too much for you? But Iain Duncan Smith's DWP is adopting tactics that are ever-closer to those of the Nazis. Now they want to force their way into people's homes, unannounced, presumably in attempts to catch out benefit cheats. What other reason could they possibly have..? 
 You may get a visit from a government officer  to check that you are being treated appropriately  for your status. * 
 A review officer may visit you if you are: 
 
 Jewish 
 Homosexual 
 A member of an ethnic minority 
 A member of a political party other than the Conservatives or Liberal Democrats 
 
 Your name is selected at random to be checked. You won’t always get a letter in advance telling you about the visit. 
 What to expect 
 The officer will interview you in your home and will want to see two forms of identification. 
 They’ll also ask to see documents about your ethnic origin, religion, and political or sexual history, including but not limited to: 
 
 Birth certificate 
 Synagogue at which you worship and the name of your rabbi 
 Passport/details of your country of origin 
 Political party membership card 
 Medical records 
 
 Visits usually last up to an hour but may be longer. 
 You may be asked to accompany our officer and be conveyed to special measures* if a more detailed interview is required. You will be treated appropriately*. 
 Check their identity 
 You can check the identity of the review officer by: 
 
 Asking to see their photo identity card and then checking their face to see if the duelling scars match. 
 
 Of course there would be outcry if the government released a press release in this form - except that's exactly what has happened, and nobody batted an eyelid because the victims are people on state benefits. 
 If you are reading this and think that's all right,  ask yourself what you 'll do when they come for  you . This government already has its eye on pensioners, and people who claim in-work benefits will not be far behind. 
 By the way, words and phrases marked * are  euphemisms from an academic website  and may be translated as follows: 
 
 Action - Mission to seek out (in this case, Jews) and kill them 
 Treated appropriately - Murdered 
 Conveyed to special measures - Killed 
 
 What 's that you're saying? "It couldn't happen here"? 
 Oh. Well, that's all right then. 
 You can go back to sleep. 
 (Anyone invoking Godwin's Law will receive special treatment* for doing so inappropriately.)

 'Mandatory reconsideration' - more money-saving by sending the sick to their deaths

 National disgrace: The green benches were almost empty during yesterday's debate on the DWP's new 'mandatory reconsideration' regime - and the potential number of deaths it is causing. 
 It is hard to know where to start. Perhaps with DWP minister Mike Penning 's failure to answer the questions raised in  yesterday's adjournment debate on the ESA 'mandatory reconsideration' process , despite having prior notice of Sheila Gilmore's entire presentation? Perhaps with the DWP's failure to release accurate statistics, which is especially appalling as press officer Richard Caseby attacked a newspaper for inaccuracies very recently? Perhaps with the DWP's continuing denial of the deaths caused by its increasingly-bizarre and unreasonable attempts to save money? 
 (Apparently they're "anecdotal" so they don't count. Does everybody recall when  Iain Duncan Smith used similarly anecdotal evidence  to support his claim that his benefit cap was "supporting" people into work, last year?) 
 The debate was brought to Parliament by Labour's Sheila Gilmore who, in her own words, has been trying to get a succession of useless Conservative ministers to acknowledge the homicidal nature of their incapacity benefit "reforms" ever since she was elected. This was her sixth debate on the subject. 
 Yesterday's debate was about the stress and poverty caused by the government's decision to impose 'mandatory reconsideration' on ESA claimants who have been found fit for work and want to appeal against the decision. The benefit - originally paid at the 'assessment' rate - is cut off during the reconsideration period, meaning that claimants have no income whatsoever; housing benefit and council tax reduction claimants have their claims interrupted during this time. 
 People might be able to accommodate this if the reconsideration period lasted the maximum of two weeks that was implied when the new system was introduced, but it doesn't take a maximum of two weeks. 
 The average length of time an ESA claimant - a person who is so seriously ill that he or she cannot work for a living, remember - has to wait for a decision after 'mandatory reconsideration' is  seven to 10 weeks . 
 That puts a different complexion on matters. 
 Ms Gilmore called on Mr Penning to confirm the length of time claimants are being made to wait for a decision after 'mandatory reconsideration' - and asked when the DWP will publish statistics on average times and the total number of claimants who are waiting for a decision (rumoured to be 700,000 at this time). 
 She said the minister had defended a decision not to set a time limit on reconsiderations, despite concern from the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council that the absence of such a limit could have the effect of “delaying indefinitely the exercise of the right of appeal to an independent tribunal”. 
 Oh yes - claimants can apply for Jobseekers' Allowance in the meantime - but this has a high level of conditionality. They have to be available for work, actively seeking work, attending work-focused interviews, searching for jobs and making a minimum number of applications every week. 
 What these Conservative DWP ministers are saying is that sick people waiting for an ESA decision must undergo a process that is itself extremely stressful, can worsen existing physical or mental conditions, and can lead to them being sanctioned or refused benefit altogether for failing to meet the requirements of Job Centre Plus advisors (who are not, let's be honest, the most sympathetic people in the country). 
 Most who have applied for JSA have been refused outright or failed to attend necessary appointments due to their various conditions; or they did not apply, either because they could not face the trial of another benefit application or because they did not know they could. 
 They were forced to turn to the food banks that  the DWP has accused  of "misleading and emotionally manipulative publicity-seeking" and "aggressively marketing their services", rather than being vitally important now that the government has reneged on its responsibility to citizens. 
 Or they turned to high-interest loans - run, undoubtedly, by  some of the Conservative Party's most faithful donors  - and amassed debts at such high interest rates that they would struggle to repay them, even after being provided backdated payments. "One constituent sold off his few remaining possessions to survive," said Ms Gilmore. 
 The Tories have engineered a situation where people who are seriously ill can be found too fit for ESA and too sick or disabled for JSA. 
 Ms Gilmore said she had been told by previous minister Mark Hoban - last September - that claimants could request "flexible conditionality", to ease these pressures - but the DWP's benefits director acknowledged in April -  seven months later  - that "not all advisors had been aware of this". 
 So claimants had been deprived of a right to extra help because DWP ministers had not provided accurate information to them or to employees. 
 Ms Gilmore said, "It is hard to have confidence in the Department, given that previous assurances were clearly unfounded," and it is interesting that this should be revealed in the same week that the useless ex-Murdoch yellow-press spin-machine detritus DWP press officer Caseby (Dick to his… well, to everybody) claimed  The Guardian  should be blackballed from new press regulation authority IPSO for failing to print, you guessed it, accurate information from the DWP. 
 Ms Gilmore also pointed out the cost to the taxpayer of all this hustling of claimants between benefits: "There is also an administration cost involved in a claimant receiving the assessment rate of ESA, ceasing to receive it, claiming JSA and then potentially claiming the assessment rate of ESA again. These are significant costs when multiplied by the number of people involved. In addition, if everybody claimed JSA successfully, they would receive benefit at exactly the same rate as they would have been getting on ESA, so if there are any savings to be anticipated, is it because ministers thought that people would, in fact, struggle to claim JSA during the reconsideration process, given that administration costs are likely to outweigh anything else? 
 "I am sure that cannot be the case," she added.  Of course that 's exactly what ministers wanted. 
 Her point was as follows: Why not amend the law so that ESA claimants can continue to receive the benefit at the assessment rate during the reconsideration process? "The only way that could be more expensive for the Government would be if ministers expected sick and disabled people to go without any benefit — and I am sure that that cannot be the case," she said, ramming home her previous point about benefit savings. 
 Reinstating assessment-rate ESA during 'mandatory reconsideration' would be simpler than setting a time limit and may be an incentive for the government to speed up the process, she added. 
 Finally, she called on Mr Penning to publish the number of successful reconsiderations, rather than lumping them in with original decisions so it is impossible to tell exactly what has happened. She said this was particularly important because  the DWP has been celebrating a drop in the number of appeals . 
 Her claim was that it is premature to celebrate a drop in appeals - or to claim the DWP was making more correct decisions - when the number of successful applications for 'mandatory reconsideration' was not known and many cases may still be caught up in the process as part of the enormous backlog built up by the Department. 
 Mr Penning made no offer to reinstate assessment-rate ESA during the reconsideration period. 
 He made no offer to impose a time limit on reconsiderations. 
 He made no attempt to confirm the size of the 'mandatory reconsideration' backlog or the length of time taken to reach decisions. 
 His response was about as inhuman as he could make it, within the Chamber of the House of Commons: 
 "I would rather have slightly more delays than have decisions incorrectly taken and then turned over at tribunal." 
 This is an admission that he would rather push sick people into unendurable poverty, debt, stress and possibly towards suicide than make his department do its job properly.

 Assembly member lives on benefits to experience the effects of 'welfare reform'

 The day job: Rebecca Evans AM in the more familiar environment of the Assembly debating chamber [Image: ITV]. 
 I wanted to share this with you because, as a constituent and a member of the Labour Party, I 'm quite proud of Mid and West Wales Labour AM Rebecca Evans, who spent a week living on an amount equivalent to Jobseekers' Allowance and discussing 'welfare reform' with people who deal with its effects on a day-to-day basis, to find out what it is like. 
 She wrote an article about her experience for   Wales Online   which I am taking the liberty of excerpting here. Over to you, Rebecca: 
 With the average household in Wales expected to lose 4.1 per cent of their income due to policy changes, support is vital for those living on the poverty line. 
 Although people are understandably cynical when politicians attempt to live life on the breadline, I wanted to raise awareness of the challenges facing welfare claimants and gain a better understanding of how well understood the changes are. 
 Living off £72.40 for one week, I did not expect to truly experience the day-to-day life of people who rely on welfare support. I was aware that when Monday came around I would step back into my normal routine. But I wanted to experience at least some of the challenges and difficult decisions facing many thousands of people every day. 
 The Your Benefits are Changing money advice team calculated that the average weekly expenditure for someone living off Jobseeker’s Allowance in my home area of Carmarthenshire leaves just £13.58 for food and essentials once transport costs, utilities, the TV licence, phone bills and the bedroom tax have been paid – which equates to less than £2 a day. 
 On this income, any trip to the supermarket becomes a stressful task as every single penny matters. 
 When speaking with job seekers, food bank volunteers, YBAC money advisors and housing association staff and tenants during the week, the message was the same: people are struggling and  many have had their lives irrevocably damaged by welfare policies . 
 The Bedroom Tax has had a serious impact on thousands of people across Wales, and the shortage of suitable housing has only enhanced poverty levels. Brought in as part of the Welfare Reform Act… the policy is estimated to have affected 36,000 tenants in the social housing sector, including 3,500 disabled households. As a direct result… housing association tenants accrued £1.1 million in arrears during the first six months. 
 Housing associations are rightly concerned that a move to monthly payments will prove incredibly challenging for those on low incomes, leading to an increase in the number of people that turn to emergency food supplies. 
 A YBAC money advisor told me food poverty levels can be worse for people who live on housing estates because they may only have one shop within walking distance, and that shop may have limited discounts. Food prices have risen by 12 per cent since 2007, so it is no surprise 900,000 people across the UK have turned to food banks in the past year… but the fact that we need food banks in 21st never ceases to be shocking. 
 The families I met during my week on benefits rely on second hand clothes and goods, and rarely buy anything new – let alone any kind of treats. They try to put aside £20 a week, but unexpected emergencies leave them unable to save. 
 A YBAC money advisor told me that around a quarter of people seeking advice are actually in work, and that the majority of children in poverty live in a household where one adult works. One mum with a young baby told me that her husband is on a zero-hour contract, meaning that the family can’t plan financially with any certainty. 
 This smashes the myth that welfare reform is all about supporting the unemployed back to work.

 Tory policy on 'zero hours': Beggars can't be choosers

 Isn 't it nice to see some clear blue water emerge between the main political parties on an important issue? 
 Less than two weeks after Ed Miliband announced that  he would tackle the "epidemic" of zero-hours contracts  if Labour wins the next general election, the Conservatives have confirmed that Universal Credit - if they can ever get it working - will force jobseekers into those very contracts. 
 Labour said workers on zero-hours contracts should not be obliged to be available outside contracted hours; be free to work for other employers; have a right to compensation if shifts are cancelled at short notice; have 'clarity' from their employer about their employment status, terms and conditions; have the right to request a contract with a 'minimum amount of work' after six months, that could only be refused if employers could prove their business could not operate any other way; and have an automatic right to a fixed-hours contract after 12 months with the same employer. 
 At the time, the Tories said the number of zero-hours contracts had increased under the last Labour government, which had done nothing about it. 
 This tired excuse has been trotted out far too many times to be taken seriously any more, but it may have led some members of the public to believe that the Tories were distancing themselves from zero-hours contracts as well. They are, after all, supposed to be The Party of More Choice. Perhaps they are, themselves, less than keen on this kind of exploitation. 
 Not a bit of it! 
 The Guardian  revealed yesterday that conditions will be imposed on the receipt of Universal Credit, meaning that - for the first time ever -  jobseekers could lose their benefits if they refuse to take zero-hour jobs  - for three months or longer. 
 Currently, people on Jobseekers' Allowance are able to refuse such jobs without facing penalties. 
 The policy change was revealed in a letter from employment minister Esther McVey to Labour MP Sheila Gilmore. She said Job Centre "coaches" would be able to "mandate to zero-hours contracts" - basically forcing them to accept this kind of exploitation by employers. 
 The DWP has also stated: "We expect claimants to do all they reasonably can to look for and move into paid work. If a claimant turns down a particular vacancy (including zero-hours contract jobs) a sanction may be applied." 
 The message from the Conservatives - the Party of More Choice - is clear:  Beggars can 't be choosers. 
 Their chums on the boards of big businesses want more profits, and know the way to get it - employ people on low pay and with no employee benefits. Zero-hours contracts mean you can be made to work fewer hours than you need in order for employers to have to pay National Insurance credits for you. You don't get sick pay; holiday pay; or a pension. And you'll probably still be on benefits, meaning the work that you do is subsidised by other hardworking taxpayers, most of whom earn only a little more than you do. 
 It's a racket - as bad as workfare/mandatory work activity/the work programme/whatever-they're-calling-it-today, in which taxpayers subsidise work carried out by jobseekers for participating employers, hugely boosting those firms' profits while ensuring that the number of people without proper, paid jobs remains high. 
 Their attitude is that, if you don't have a job, you are a beggar. 
 Beggars can 't be choosers. 
 So  they 'll  choose what you do, and they - or their boardroom chums - will benefit from it. 
 If you are a working taxpayer, think about this before casting your vote later this month - and especially before you do so in May 2015:  A vote for the Conservative Party  means  more  of your fellow citizens will be  prevented  from getting proper jobs and becoming contributing members of society by the greedy - and idle - rich. 
 A vote for the Conservative Party  means  more  of your tax money going to  subsidise  fat business board members who already have more money than they can ever use. 
 A vote for the Conservative Party  means a better life for them and their friends - and  a poorer life for you . 
 You 'd have to be mad to choose that.

 The government 's latest draconian measure - to drive people who have been living off the state for more than three years into all the nonexistent jobs that ministers insist are waiting for them - was launched today. (Monday) 
 Help to Work forces jobseekers to sign on every day, commit to six months of voluntary work, or sign up to a training scheme (the last two effectively removing them from the government's unemployment figures without getting them a job) - or face having their Jobseeker's Allowance docked for increasing lengths of time. 
 It 's clearly a scam to fiddle the joblessness statistics  but, dear reader, you're intelligent enough to have worked it out before you even started reading this. 
 Of course, voluntary work must be offered without coercion - otherwise it's slavery - and for this reason leading charities have already announced that they will boycott the mandatory work placement part of the scheme. 
 Particularly disturbing - and we should be grateful that they highlighted this - is the fact that this aspect would lead to jobseekers doing more than double the 300-hours'-maximum community work than convicted criminals, who are ordered to carry out certain tasks as punishment for their offences. 
 The Guardian   used the government's own data to prove that Help to Work does not increase anybody's chances of getting a job, and is more likely to put people off signing on for the benefits to which they are entitled - a 'punishment' effect that the government is desperate to play down. 
 Esther McVey, speaking on Radio 4's  Today  programme in support of the scheme, said instead that it would be particularly useful for "people who have been away from the marketplace and the workplace for long periods of time", and specifically mentioned those suffering from mental illness. 
 All right then, let's ask this: 
 How well would this scheme fare in trying to find a job for a man aged 60 with no academic qualifications worth mentioning (left school at 14 and has lied about further education achievements), whose working life consists of a failed Army career that lasted less than six years, followed by irregular stints selling arms, working in a property company and selling gun-related magazines, in between periods on the dole. He has been funded by the taxpayer continuously since 1992 - a total of 22 years 'parked' at our expense. There are concerns about his state of mind, with fears that he suffers from paranoia and delusions. 
 Could Help to Work  really  find a job for a man like this? 
 Let 's hope so - because, if there's any justice, Iain Duncan Smith will be looking for a job after next year's general election.

 There 's something not quite right about the DWP's latest statistics covering benefit sanctions. 
 I'd go into it in detail but, in the spirit of the saying that a picture can tell a story better than a thousand words, let's just have a look at this graph instead (courtesy of @UKJCP on Twitter). 
 
 By my reckoning, somebody's calculations started to go seriously amiss in November 2012.

 And who do you think is to blame?

 Jobseekers told to do more to find (non-existent) work

 Esther McVile: The employment minister, who claims adamantly that changes to housing benefit do not constitute a 'bedroom tax', is pictured complaining about a so-called 'tunnel tax' in her own constituency in a blatant display of double standards. 
 WARNING: This article has been edited using the  'Guide to DWP euphemisms'  published by Richard Hutton, and with inspiration from it. 
 New rules coming into force at the end of the month mean jobseekers will have to do more to find work - even though there are currently five of them for every job available - the Department for Work and Pensions has announced. 
 Simply ‘signing-on’ for benefits will be a thing of the past under the draconian and repressive new rules. 
 Employment Minister  and double-standards queen  Esther McVey has hailed the new rules as undermining the range of support available, which helps diminish aspects of the social security system so that it no longer protects anybody from being left impoverished - in this case by making sure people cannot start claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) by just signing-on without first humbling themselves before the Tory-led government. 
 She said: “With the economy growing, unemployment falling and record numbers of people in work, now is the time to start expecting more of shirkers if they want to claim benefits. It’s only right that we should push people who are unemployed into such a depth of poverty that even 'in-work' poverty is a step-up. 
 “This is about taking support away from people and undermining the range of support available to them so they can hit rock bottom faster. In return, we will give people as much harassment as possible, to make them stop scrounging or face sanctions, because we know from employers that we have to break people's spirit before they'll work for a really low wage.” 
 To prepare for their first interview with a Jobcentre Plus adviser, people looking for work will be told they will not even be able to sign as unemployed until they have prepared a CV, set up an email address - even though they might not have a computer on which to use it - and registering with the government’s discredited jobs website Universal Jobmatch, which will expose them to identity thieves and exploiters looking for sex workers. This change will make it possible to exploit people as soon as they start their JSA claim. 
 People who don't tow the line will receive more harassment from their Jobcentre Plus adviser – weekly rather than fortnightly – to ensure they can be cleared off the books via sanctions if it proves impossible to push them into poverty work. 
 All new JSA claimants will also now have a quarterly review with their adviser, who will try to find a reason to impose sanctions and get them off the books. 
 These new measures are being introduced as figures show the number of people claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance fell by over 363,000 on the year, the largest annual fall since 1998. This shows that the system of sanctions, putting people on Workfare to hide the fact that they are unemployed, and asking them to pretend that they are self-employed in order to fraudulently claim tax credits instead, is working. 
 The government is committed to sanctions and the vast majority of people are bullied off JSA quickly – more than 75 per cent of people end their claim within six months. Every working day Jobcentre Plus advisers shout at 98,000 interviews jobseekers and there are a range of ploys available to push them off the system. These include: 
 • Hiding them on the Work Programme 
• Referring them for 'training' by companies that provide the minimum help available, take the money and run 
• Putting people on pointless 'work experience' that won't lead to a job but will clear them off the claimant count 
• Fooling people with 'incentives' that mean nothing 
• Getting people to pretend they are self-employed.

 Another ESA-related death but the DWP wants us to believe there's no connection

 The latest person to die while facing a change to his sickness benefit is Neil Groves, who was hit by a train at Surbiton station on his 46th birthday. 
 Mr Groves died just after 7.30pm on February 13. His father Ronald, 78, told local paper the  Kingston Guardian  a potential change to his son’s Employment and Support Allowance “must have” weighed on him. 
 He said: “He has obviously had it in his mind. They basically told him that his assessment was coming up again. 
 “He knew it probably would be the end of his sickness and disability and he would go back on to [Jobseekers' Allowance]. 
 “He said he would not be able to manage on that wage a week. It is all part and parcel of it.” 
 Mr Groves had received Incapacity Benefit for some years, his father said, which was stopped after an assessment, and he was not moved on to ESA. 
 He later won an appeal against the decision. 
 He had recently been diagnosed with chronic depression. 
 You can read the story  on the newspaper's website . 
 The DWP, in an email to the Information Commissioner that was copied to yr obdt srvt as part of the disclosure process for the forthcoming tribunal on claimant mortality statistics, has stated: "There is no evidence of a link between the death of an individual and their receipt of a social security benefit." 
 Do you think that 's accurate?

 The questions that Sunday Politics WON'T ask Iain Duncan Smith

 Like it or not, politics in the UK is far more nuanced today than it has been at any time in the last 100 years. How can it be anything else? All the main political parties are trying to occupy the same, narrow, centre-right ground. 
 Even so, one man has emerged as the pantomime villain of British politics: Iain Duncan Smith. 
 ConservativeHome  readers regularly vote him into the top slot as the most popular cabinet minister - but it seems that anyone who has ever had dealings with his Department for Work and Pensions has the exact opposite opinion of him. He has been nicknamed IDS, but this blog calls him RTU instead - it stands for 'Returned To Unit', a military term for serving soldiers who have failed in officer training and have been returned in disgrace to their original unit (the implication being that his claim of a glittering military career is about as accurate as his claims to have been educated at the University of Perugia and Dunchurch College of Management). 
 Here at  Vox Political  , we believe that this man's tenure at the DWP will go down in history as one of the greatest disasters of British political history - not just recent history, but for all time. It is our opinion that his benefit-cutting policies have done more to accelerate the impoverishment of hard-working British people than the worst recession in the last century could ever have done by itself. 
 We believe the assessment regime for sickness and disability benefits, over which he has presided, has resulted in so many deaths that it could be considered the worst genocide this country has faced since the Harrowing of the North, almost 1,000 years ago. 
 That will be his legacy. 
 On Sunday, he will appear on the BBC's  Sunday Politics  show to answer  your  questions about his work. The show's  Facebook page  has invited readers to submit their own questions and this seems an appropriate moment to highlight some of those that have been submitted - but are never likely to be aired; RTU is far too vain to allow hyper-critical questioning to burst his bubble. 
 Here is our choice of just some questions he won't be answering: 
 "Why [has he] decided to cover up the number of suicides due to [his] benefit cuts?" "Why is he killing the elderly and the disabled?" "Does he have a figure (number of deaths) before he accepts a policy might not be working?" 
 "Universal Jobmatch, Universal Credit, WCA reforms, PIP; are there any policies and projects he has tried to implement that haven't been a massive shambolic waste of money, causing distress and sanctions to so many people?" 
 "Would he like to comment on the huge amount of people wrongly sanctioned, and would he like to explain why whistleblowers from the JCP have admitted there  are  sanction targets?" 
 "Ask him if he believes a comparison can be drawn between the government's persecution of the sick, disabled and mentally ill and the 'Action T4' instigated by the Nazis in 1939. I am sure the tow-the-line BBC will give him sight of the questions before he gets on the show so he will have time to look it up." 
 "People are now waiting months for their appeals to be heard and the meantime their benefits are stopped. What does he expect them to live on? Why [are] he and his Department pursuing this deliberate war against some of our most poor and vulnerable people?" 
 "Could he comment on the massive amount of money written off due to failures with the Universal Credit?" 
 "Why are we paying private companies to test disabled and sick people when one phone call to their consultant or GP would provide all relevant details they need?" 
 "[Does] he have any intention of putting his money where his mouth is, [living] on £53/week, and how does he square that with the £39 on expenses he claimed for breakfast? Half a million people signed the call for him to do so." 
 "Why are full time carers who look after loved ones only paid £59.75 a week? Less than JSA, indeed less than any other benefit! they save the tax payers millions, and yet have still been hammered by the changes in housing benefit, council tax benefit and of course the hated bedroom tax." 
 "Ask him about the Universal Jobsearch website and the fake jobs on the site. As a jobseeker, this site need[s] better monitoring." 
 "Ask him if the bedroom tax was really just a deceitful way to remove all social housing and force people into private rentals for the rich to claim housing benefits paid to claimants." 
 "Does he think that paying subsidies to supermarkets and other private companies via welfare benefits because they do not pay well enough is what government should be doing?" 
 Some of the questioners address Mr… Smith directly: 
 "Why do you keep testing people with incurable progressive illnesses? Once found unfit to work, [they] never will get any better so to retest is stressful, cruel, and not needed." 
 "Why are you telling Jobcentre Plus staff to get ESA claimants and JSA claimants to declare themselves self-employed, then reeling them in with the promise of an extra £20 per week? Is this why the unemployment rate fell last quarter?" 
 "You say you want the sick off what you call the scrap heap but with few jobs out there, do you mean off the scrap heap into the destitute gutter?" 
 "Do you feel remotely guilty for the lives you've ruined? the lies you've told? The dead people on your hands? Do you feel any shame at all that you've done all this and more? Do you sleep well at night knowing there are people who can't feed their children because of you?" 
 "As a committed Roman Catholic, how does your conscience deal with you supporting and advantaging privileged millionaires while you personally and systematically further impoverish the poor and disadvantaged?" 
 "Does he feel ashamed to have caused so much suffering, because he flipping well should!" 
 There were many more questions that were not appropriate for repetition. 
 To see what he  does  have to say for himself, tune in to Sunday Politics on BBC1, starting at 11am on March 9 (which is, as you might have guessed, Sunday). 
 Just don 't get your hopes up.
