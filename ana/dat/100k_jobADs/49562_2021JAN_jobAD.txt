 WHY DO WE SHOW EXPIRED LISTINGS? 
 We recently acquired a 42 lot mobile home park in Rogers. We are a safe, sleepy mobile home park where all tenants are homeowners and hardworking families living in an affordable community. 
 We are looking to hire either: 
(1) an ON-SITE manager couple or individual who would live RENT-FREE in the 2BD/1BA single family home at the front of the park (approximately 1,000 sf) -- photo attached. Estimated rent is $800 per month, or $9,600 per year. 
(2) an OFF-SITE manager couple or individual who is local to the area and can visit frequently and on short-notice if necessary. Management fees would be $500 per month or $6,000 per year. 
 In your reply, please indicate whether you are interested in on-site or off-site management. 
 Park Overview 
The park has 42 lots that are 100% occupied. All mobile homes are owned by tenants. There are 4 RV sites with more transient residents. Most of the community has lived there for 5 or more years. 
 Responsibilities 
While the property manager is always "on-call", total expected work need is ~5 hours in an average week. Unlike apartments, tenants own their own homes, so you would not be responsible for 2am phone calls to unplug toilets. Unlike apartments, there is limited turnover - most tenants live permanently and do not leave after only a year. 
 The overarching responsibility of the Community Manager is to keep Dixieland MHP a safe, clean, organized place to live. This is achieved through: 
+ Communicating regularly with the ownership group through text, email, and phone calls 
+ Maintaining the quality of the community -- enforcing community rules and regulations (clean yards, no large dogs, etc.); ensuring community is clean; attending to basic repair & maintenance needs 
 + Coordinating outside contractors for more complex repair and maintenance needs 
+ Reading gas meters to measure and bill for individual monthly usage 
+ Following up in person or by phone with tenants late to pay rent 
+ Handing out individual flyers to residents 
+ Marketing and leasing the RV lots as they become vacant 
+ Processing lease applications for new tenants buying homes in the community 
 This is a great fit for a husband & wife to be a repairman & property manager combo. Detailed contract to be provided to serious candidates. 
 Responsibilities do NOT include (1) day-to-day rent collections -- tenants pay through direct deposit and owners manage, (2) paying large recurring property expenses like utility, tax, or insurance bills -- owners manage; or (3) fixing tenant's homes. 
 Skills 
+ Basic computer skills 
+ Spanish speaking is a STRONG plus 
+ Experience with handyman / repair work
