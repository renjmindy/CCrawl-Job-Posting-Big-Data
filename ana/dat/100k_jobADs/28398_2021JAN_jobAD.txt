 Sterling Holloway: From Broadway Baby to Bear of Little Brain 
 Sterling Holloway  (1905-1992) was born on this day. I'm sure I'm not alone when I say I first knew this amazing performer as a voice -- the highly distinctive voice of  Walt Disney's  Winnie the Pooh. In the end, that's got to be his best known character, but show biz buffs know how impressive his overall resume is. He was chosen for Pooh because Americans had already known and loved that voice for decades, not just in the movies but on radio and in the theatre. But his appearance was just as remarkable as his high-pitched, scratchy voice. He was skinny, with a big parrot beak of a nose, extremely bushy eyebrows, lips like a couple of earthworms, and a tousled mop of hair you could tell was red even in a black and white movie. He was just the guy you wanted to play a store clerk or messenger boy. He often seemed kind of sleepy or like he'd just rolled out of bed, although other times he could run around in consternation as though the house were on fire. He looked like a gawky, awkward, self-conscious teenager well into middle age, which meant that he could play these kinds of parts for many years. 
 Cedartown, Georgia is proud to call him a son. 
 Amusingly, he'd actually started out in a store -- his parents ran a grocery in small town Georgia. He attended the Georgia Military Academy for high school. Only 15 when he graduated, he went to New York and studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, where his fellow pupils included  Spencer Tracy  and  George O'Brien , useful friends in years to come, no doubt. After completing his studies, he briefly barnstormed with a stock company performing a version of  The Shepherd of the Hills.  Then, __ when only 18, he began acting in bit roles with the Theatre Guild on Broadway.  The Failures  (1923-1924) put him in a cast with  Henry Travers   , Erskine Sanford  and  Morris Carnovsky .  Fata Morgana  (1924) came next. 
 In 1925, he was featured in  The Garrick Gaieties  ,  a revue  devised by  Rodgers and Hart  to raise money for the Theatre Guild (the venue for their productions was The Garrick Theatre). The benefit show was such a hit, it was held over on Broadway, and two other editions were produced in 1926 and 1930. Holloway was in all three casts. It's a little known fact that Holloway was a gifted singer. In the 1925 edition, he introduced the Rodgers and Hart song "Manhattan". In 1926 he introduced "Mountain Greenery." 
 In 1926, he went west and had a brief career in silent comedy, another little known fact. He was in the Fox short  The Battling Kangaroo  (1926) with  Lige Conley ; the Paramount feature  Casey at the Bat  (1927) with  Wallace Beery,   ZaSu Pitts  and  Ford Sterling ; and two  Mack Sennett  shorts:  The Girl From Everywhere  (1927), with  Daphne Pollard ,  Dot Farley ,  Carole Lombard ,  Mack Swain ,  Billy Bevan  and  Andy Clyde ; and its sequel  The Girl From Nowhere  (1928), with much of the same cast. 
 He returned to Broadway for one additional show, the short-lived and ironically titled  Get Me in the Movies  (1928). And then he did just that -- returned to the movies, where that instantly recognizable voice now became a huge asset, because talkies had arrived. Even in bit roles, his voice allows you to know it's him right away, and those turns are the highlight of many a Pre-Code picture. He's in  Frank Capra's   American Madness  (1932),  Blonde Venus  (1932) with  Marlene Dietrich ,  Lawyer Man  (1932) with  William Powell , all in small roles, but he leaps off the screen. He plays  Joe E. Brown's  kid brother in  Elmer the Great  (1933). He's in Paramount all-star films like  International House   and  Alice in Wonderland,  and the  Warner Brothers  musical  Gold Diggers of 1933  (all released the same, remarkable year). And  Life Begins at 40  (1935) with  Will Rogers ! 
 At the same time, while he was playing bit parts in major films, he starred in his own comedy shorts, while the form lasted, anyway:  Not the Marrying Kind  (1933),  Meeting Mazie  (1934),  Born April First  (1934),  Pleasing Grandpa  (1934),  Picnic Perils  (1934),  Sterling 's Rival Romeo  (1934),  Father Knows Best  (1935),  My Girl Sally  (1935),  Doubles Crossed  (1935),  His Last Fling  (1935),  Bring 'Em Back a Lie  (1935),  Moron Than Off  (1946), and  Hectic Honeymoon  (1947). 
 Holloway's in  Professor Beware  (1938) with Harold Lloyd ,  Preston Sturges's   Remember the Night  (1940), and  Capra 's Meet John Doe  (1941). 
 In 1941 he began the long professional relationship with  Disney.  You can hear his voice in  Dumbo  (1941),  Bambi  (1942),  The Three Caballeros  (1944),  Peter and the Wolf  (1946),  Mickey and the Beanstalk  (1947),  Alice in Wonderland  (1951), many  Winnie the Pooh  films starting in 1966,  The Jungle Book  (1967),  The Aristocats  (1970), and much else. 
 The voice had him constantly working in radio from the late '30s through the '50s, on shows like  Fibber McGee and Molly , the  Lux Radio Theatre  , and many others. 
 Holloway had a number in the all star World War II morale booster  Star Spangled Rhythm  (1942), and spent time during the war in uniform, producing shows to raise money for the troops. In 1945, he was one of the cast of the remarkable WWII film  A Walk in the Sun  (1945), one of the clear models for  Spielberg's   Saving Private Ryan. 
 In 1946 and 1947 he was  Gene Autry's  sidekick in musical westerns, in appeared in many other westerns besides. In 1949, Preston Sturges employed him to great hilarity in  The Beautiful Blond of Bashful Bend. 
 Staring in the 1950s, most of his work going forward was in television, in guest shots on popular programs, sometimes acting in tv movies, and getting recurring parts on such shows as  The Adventures of Superman  (1953-1955),  The Life of Riley  (1953-1956),  Circus Boy  (1957),  The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin   (1956-1958),  The Baileys of Balboa  (1964-1965), and of course  Walt Disney 's Wonderful World of Color  (1957-1982). 
 He was wisely included in the all-star 1963 comedy _ It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,  _alongside Spencer Tracy, whom he'd known for 43 years at that point, and ZaSu Pitts, whom he'd known almost as long. And he kept working almost right up until the end. His last professional credit was a bit of narration for the tv show  Moonlighting  in 1986. In later years he was often cast that way, to bring a bit of nostalgic magic. Entire generations had grown up with him, as a small but cherished part of their lives.
