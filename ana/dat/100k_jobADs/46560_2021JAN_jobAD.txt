 Lazy thought that saves me burbling : I agree verbatim with Peter Bradshaw's review in The Grauniad, even though I despair of their copy editors: Levis will NEVER have an apostrophe. My one caveat is that this is still a male dominated film. Director writer star conspire to do nothing whatsoever to dislodge the eternal narrative of A Man's Gotta Do What A Man's Gotta Do.
