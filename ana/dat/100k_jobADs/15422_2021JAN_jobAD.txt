 Do the Job You Didn't Get (1 min read)

 So, you applied for a job, took a lot of time and effort with the application process, were really enthusiastic, had all the skills and experience requiredâ€¦ And didn't even make the interview. 
 It happens. And, when it does, it's easy to give up, to believe that you couldn't have done the job anyway. 
 But there's nothing to stop you doing the job, or something very like it, off your own bat. Okay, you won't get an office, free coffee, or a salary (at least at first), but, if you have a genuine interest, the salary may well follow on from that - and it may be better than you would have been paid if you'd got the job. 
 Social media, including blog sites like WordPress, are your friend at this point - it costs nothing to set up a WordPress blog, a Facebook page, and a Twitter feed - not in the name of the company you applied to, of course, but in a name of your choosing. 
 Don't follow the job description to the letter - innovate around it, extrapolate from it, make it your own. 
 You might just be surprised at what comes from opening a side door when the main one was slammed in your face.

 Love this! When I couldn't find work it drove me to creating work for myself. I always encourage people with neglected skills to start their own business even if it's super hard at first. There's a market for everything out there, you just have to tap into it. This post is awesome!

 This is the exact mindset that drove me to stop applying for post-grad jobs and start my own blog. I'm excited to see where it will take me ðŸ™‚ Thanks for sharing!

 I believe our purpose all along was to CREATE our jobs instead scurrying around trying to find one.

 The employement now have gotten competitive for years so having multiple skills or talents outside job description surely helps you a lot to stand out among your peers.

 Hi, this a short, but very meaningful post. 
When a major door closes and a side one opens, then this might be a real door of opportunity, if one plays his or her cards right, persists, and has the patience and sensibility to pursue a vision. 
I mean, that once-in-a-lifetime big job can be just an illusion; you didnâ€™t lose what you never had at first place. Moving on and finding the right path and career is what counts. After all, we should not forget the old saying: every cloud has a silver liningâ€¦

 My wife graduated with a double degree two years ago. Since then, unemployment has rocketed (Western Australia) and her passion to finding a job relevant to her field was crushedâ€¦.thankfully, her passion to creating her own business was not! The business is still in the early stages but she's doing what she loves and to me, it's priceless! Highly recommended to everyone!
