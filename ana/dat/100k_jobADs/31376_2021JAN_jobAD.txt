 Review | Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson 
 01.10.12   judkossum   Leave a comment 
 My rating:  4 of 5 stars 
 As someone who geeks out a little over Silicon Valley history and the birth of the personal computer, the first several chapters of  Walter Isaacson's biography of the iconic Apple CEO  were particularly engaging. While the rest of the book was not quite as exciting to read, it was still worthwhile. 
 Isaacson's style is conversational and easy, making for a quick, fluid 571 pages. At times he leaves out details that might better inform certain situations, but this may have be necessary in keeping the focus on Jobs rather than on Apple and its products. 
 The book doesn't sugarcoat Jobs. Indeed, there would be no point, since his perfectionism and brutality are legendary - at least to those who are fans of Apple. He is presented here as, quite honestly, a jerk. He is also presented as a genius. He is presented as not much of a father but as a great corporate leader. All are probably true. 
 However, Isaacson does show his bias when it comes to the company Jobs started and saved and its products. Sometimes he seems so in love with Apple, Inc. that it annoys even me! (I'm a proud Mac and iPhone user and  Macworld.com  reader.) 
 In the end, the book certainly gives one a well-rounded view of Steve Jobs, his relationships - both personal and professional - and the company he built. Definitely a worthy read.
