  How To Make A Midlife Career Change  
 Michael Price 
 December 05, 2014 
 Mid-lifers, Baby Boomers, or whatever you want to call them have been counted out.  Related:   The Challenges & Rewards Of A Mid-Life Career Change  They’ve been told by corporations and the news media that their time is up and that it’s time for them to make way for Gen X and the Millennials. How on Earth are they supposed to do that considering that Baby Boomers are still 15-20 years away from retirement? I’m not a Baby Boomer. I’m not even a Gen Xer. I’m a Millennial, so it may sound strange that I’m giving advice to people who are twice my age. However, I’ve worked side by side with Baby Boomers on a highly professional level for several years, and I’m not talking about them being my boss. I’m talking about them being my counterpart. They are struggling. They feel trapped and they feel like they’re useless and unskilled. I have news for you. It’s not over. However, it is time for you to reinvent yourself. I actually believe that Mid-lifers are in a perfect position to make a career change and continue to elevate themselves up the ladder, as well as increase their income. Mid-lifers are in a perfect position to do this because they have what Gen Xer’s and Millennials don’t have which is job experience. Where Mid-lifers go wrong in many instances is they’re approaching employment as if we’re still in 1995. Many of them have outdated resumes, their skills are lacking and their track record is squeaky-clean which doesn’t bode well in today’s employment environment. Employers today are looking for people with diverse backgrounds. They’re even looking for people who have job hopped here and there, because history shows that employees who have job hopped have a more well-rounded career experience which leads to more proficiency and a higher level skill set. If you’re a Mid-lifer and you want to make a career change, you must start by doing the following: 
 
 
 Update your resume and ensure that it is properly formatted for both job posting site robots and human beings 
 Build a personal brand which highlights your career accomplishments 
 Make your personal brand public by creating a website portfolio 
 Write a book outlining your years of expertise’ in your field 
 Start an industry blog 
 Build a stockpile of reference letters from former managers and colleagues 
 Learn new skills online (Lynda.com, Udemy.com, etc) 
 
 Mid-lifers, don’t count yourself out. The world isn’t done with you unless you cave in and surrender.
