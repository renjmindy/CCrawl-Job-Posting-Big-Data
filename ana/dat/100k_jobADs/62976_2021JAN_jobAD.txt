 Safa Shaqsy born in Oman, Middle East. She's 27 years old and has successfully published several books online and offline, and has opened her own publishing business called Modern Publish. 
 1) How did you get started working from home? 
 Before I got into writing books, I used to read novels my dad used to buy for me from the bookstore in my city. But only when the cosmetics business that I wished to open didn't work out, so my dad suggested that I write a book since I loved reading fiction. I started writing in May 2015, and have published a few books since then. My latest books this year are  Washed Out  and  Rebel With Time . After a while I thought of opening a publishing websites to help authors achieve success. 
 2) How did you choose the work-at-home career you do? 
 Well, by luck, I guess. If the difficult situations didn't happen in my life, I wouldn't have thought if writing. 
 3) How did you get started (basic initial steps)? 
 I started with only one book,  The Finite  (available as paperback now) which was supposed to be a series, but kept writing different books to see which genre suited me best. Throughout the years I struggled to get an agent/publisher to represent my books, and ended up opening one myself. 
 4) How did you get your first client or customer or job? 
 Advertising did the trick, really. I think if you want to reach to readers or writers, you need to be loud about it. I mean by doing lots of advertising. I get most of authors manuscripts through Twitter pitch contests. I get a lot of queries from there. 
 5) How do you market your business? 
 Could be paid advertisements or word of mouth. I really do care about my readers and authors. 
 6) What does your usual day look like? 
 Attend to work in the morning, and write in the evening. I really try to juggle a lot of things which includes doing house chores and taking care of my family. It's hard some days, but worth it! 
 7) What do you know now that you wish you knew when you started? 
 Not to file unfinished books in my hard drive! 
 8) What advice would you give someone who wants to work from home? 
 They need to be consistent about it, and motivation should be created every day. Writing and publishing should be one of priorities in life like how your day job is important to you. I now also became a fashion, beauty and travel blogger on Instagram.
