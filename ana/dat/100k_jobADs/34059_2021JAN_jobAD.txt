 When are you going to get a real job? 
 Dirty Jobs 
 One of my Facebook friends, whom I have known long before the Internet, responded to my new job as a school bus driver with "Now I know you are old." Very funny. Ha Ha. She should watch me doing pushups. 
 It did start me thinking about our perception of people in certain jobs. There is not much doubt that all of us stereotype at least some of the time. We talk about "ditch diggers" or "garbage collectors" as if those jobs, however they are defined, are the lowest of the low. I wonder though. 
 One time many years ago, I showed up at a Galveston, Texas temporary labor office only to be sent to be a small Gulf oil rig tender as a deck-man while the boat was in harbor. Described as a job in which "you must be willing to do what average and ordinary people are not willing to do." That was an understatement. Picture a typical high school boy's bedroom and multiply that by 50 or so bunked in one section and add the large shower area. Then just imagine a tornado going through just before you walk in to clean. 
 The obvious point is that people actually do the dirty jobs. Mike Rowe

 The obvious point is that real people actually do this kind of stuff.  Mike Rowe  does many of them on the Discovery Channel's "Dirty Jobs" and it is clear that he is always relieved that each particular episode is finished. Even if we who sit in air conditioned offices or jet from city-to-city in our vocations think we are not that bad off, what in the world would do without those workers? 
 One of my fellow school bus drivers admitted that his family bugged him all the time to get a "real" job. I wonder if any of them were a parent standing with their kindergarten girl or boy, entrusting that child to to the driver on the yellow bus, would they dare say it was not a significant role in the life of the young people. 
 I really don't mind my friends making fun of me. I give it back in spades. Meanwhile, next time you see a person in a job that you think is probably beneath you, remember, first of all, that is a real person at work and, secondly, who would do it for you if they didn't?
