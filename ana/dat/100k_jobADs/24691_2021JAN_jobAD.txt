  pay-gap 
 
 Considering the push to get more women into tech, you might think companies would be throwing bushels of money at female computer programmers. But as it turns out, you’d be wrong. 
 According to a study released Wednesday by  Glassdoor , computer programmers have the largest wage gap of any profession examined by the career site, with female programmers making an average of 72 cents for every dollar earned by their male counterparts. 
 Glassdoor looked at 505,000 salary report from 25 industries, controlling for factors like type of company and workers’ level of experience. Here’s a look at the top 10 jobs with the biggest adjusted pay gaps.

Conversely, Glassdoor found that jobs historically held by women have smaller, or even reversed, gaps.

Census data tells us that the top jobs for women are low-paid careers like cashier and secretary. If men outnumber women in lucrative fields like programming and  the top ranks of medicine -and those women who do make it into those jobs are paid substantially less than their male colleagues,-is it any wonder that recent estimates suggest that it will take us another  117 years  to close the global pay gap?
