 By NY Workers Compensation Attorneys 
 **On the Job Injury Attorney - Hauppauge ** 
 Workers are always on the “front lines” of workplace safety challenges. Because they stand the most to lose if something goes wrong, they are often the most acutely aware of whether or not a specific workplace or site is truly safe. Unfortunately, even when employers insist that conditions are perfectly safe, workers sometimes learn that these assurances are not grounded in reality. 
 When faced with a workplace safety challenge, workers have two options. First, they may opt to approach their company’s management and attempt to get the issue addressed internally. This is usually how such situations progress and are solved. After all, most companies do not want to risk liability if their workers are hurt on the job and are therefore eager to solve safety issues before they become truly problematic. However, this is not always the case. Some workers understandably fear retaliation if they report work safety issues, even internally. They fear for their jobs, their potential for advancement and/or for the possibility that conditions will worsen if existing challenges are reported. It is under these kinds of circumstances that workers may opt to act as whistleblowers with the assistance of a  Hauppauge on the job injury attorney . 
 Protections for Workplace Safety Whistleblowers 
 Workplace safety whistleblower protections are overseen by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration. This agency helps to enforce nearly two dozen federal whistleblower statutes that apply to a host of American industries. If you are interested in acting as a safety-related whistleblower, please contact a Hauppauge on the job injury attorney. There are limited situations in which such protections do not apply, so it is important to relay your situation to an attorney before committing to taking this step. Speaking with a Hauppauge on the job injury attorney will help you to make an informed decision about your legal options, including acting as a whistleblower. 
 It is also worth noting that a Hauppauge on the job injury attorney can help you to file an anonymous safety violation claim with OSHA at any time. Anyone can file such claims anonymously in order to alert OSHA that they need to inspect the workplace in question. 
 Workers’ Compensation Assistance Is Available 
 If you have been injured while on the job and/or are concerned about the safety conditions at your place of employment, please do not hesitate to contact an experienced Hauppauge on the job injury attorney today. There is nothing more pressing than workplace safety when it comes to the daily operations of commercial enterprises. Should you have any questions whatsoever about reporting workplace safety issues, acting as a whistleblower, obtaining workers’ compensation benefits or filing suit against your employer for harm suffered needlessly while on the job, please contact an attorney at  Polsky, Shouldice & Rosen, P.C.  as soon as you possibly can. The more quickly you obtain legal guidance, the greater assurance you may have that your legal options will remain viable. We look forward to speaking with you.
