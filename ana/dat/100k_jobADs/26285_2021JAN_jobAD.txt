 Ski Resort jobs in Hokkaido (summer and winter) 
 In Hokkaido, on a Working Holiday visa, you can get a job at a  large ski resort  during the  winter and summer seasons  , either as a  sports instructor  (in the wintertime: skiing and snowboarding; in the summertime: mountain biking, tennis, pilates, yoga and archery), as a  hotel and hospitality service staff  , as a  guest entertainer  , or at  childcare . 
 The resort jobs  don't require any Japanese language skills!  You should however be able to communicate in English. If you do know some Japanese however, it is of course of advantage! 
 We will arrange your ski resort job in Japan prior to your travel to Japan, so that you can start it right after your arrival to Japan (or also later if you prefer). 
 Which jobs can I do at the ski resort? 
 The luxurious resort in the mountains of Hokkaido is part of an international chain. It has about 40% foreign, English speaking guests, particularly from Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, China and Europe. 
 The winter season lasts from  mid-November to mid-April . The summer season is from  June to October . You should work at the resort for at least 1 month, but 3 months or more is preferred. You can also combine the ski resort job with our other Working Holiday programs in Japan. 
 The weekly working time for all jobs is 40 hours (5 days per week x 8 hours) 
 
 Hotel and hospitality jobs 
 
 Receptionist/Front Desk, Waiter/Waitress, Kitchen Assistant, Baggage Handler, Dishwasher, Room Service, Bedmaker, Laundry personell . No previous experience is required for these activities. The hourly wage is 950 yen, of which no further taxes will be deducted. Thus, the monthly wage in case of a 40-hour week is about 160,000 yen = about 1280 EUR/1130 GBP/1990 AUD. 
 
 Sports instructor 
 
 In winter:  snowboarding and skiing  , in summer:  tennis, archery, mountain biking, yoga, pilates . You should have respective previous knowledge and experience as an instructor. For the ski and snowboard instructur jobs it is a requirement to have a relevant license. The hourly wage depends on your experience level and will be discussed during the Skype interview. It is higher than for the hotel and catering jobs. 
 
 **Guest entertainer 
** 
 
 You'll entertain guests during the day, you participate in the evening entertainment program, and you do activities with children at the resort's Kids Club. You will also dine with the guests at the restaurant and will do your best to make them feel comfortable. You should have previous experiences for these jobs. The hourly pay will be discussed during the Skype job interview. 
 How am I accommodated? 
 The resort provides a single room of high standard at the resort for only 5000 yen (about 40 EUR/45 USD) per month! One bathroom is shared by two neighbouring single rooms for staff members.
