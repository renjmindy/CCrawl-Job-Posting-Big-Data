 Can we apply the architecture of March Madness to job search? 
 March 13, 2018 Eileen Kohan 
 Let’s say you’re totally undecided (confused, terrified, ambivalent) about your next career move. All you know is you’re not happy with your current options. Where do you begin? 
 Try categorizing your interests using the bracket system. Instead of four regions, fill in four career fields that might interest you. Next, identify sixteen possible employers in each field. Once you have your potential employer roster identified, begin your research. 
 This may be a good time to develop a parallel list of contacts: a bracket representing your network. Use the same four career categories and identify folks who have broad expertise in the profession. In this ‘exploration’ phase you are aggregating data about industry trends, market leaders, and potential for growth. 
 As you progress with your data gathering, you will begin to eliminate some organizations in favor of others. Once you get to your ‘elite eight’ employers, schedule your in-depth information interviews. 
 As you talk to people you will begin to establish a realistic assessment of ‘organization fit’, and evaluate your chances for success. 
 The ‘elite eight’ forms your target list. By the time you have narrowed your selection to eight, you should feel comfortable that each employer presents a realistic starting point in the next phase your career. 
 As with any selection process, you don’t have total control. The employer extends the offer and you have the choice to accept or continue to pursue other options. 
 Add a little ‘March Madness’ to your job search, and some fun to a typically stressful routine.
