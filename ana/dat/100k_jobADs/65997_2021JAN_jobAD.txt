 Let OSHA Do Its Job 
 
 OSHA is being prevented from fulfilling its mission. 
 Today's post comes from guest author Paul J. McAndrew, Jr. from Paul McAndrew Law Firm. 
 In 1970, Congress passed the  Occupational Safety & Health Act  (the Act), which created the  Occupational Safety & Health Administration  (OSHA). Among other things, the Act requires every employer to provide a safe workplace. To help employers reach this goal, OSHA promulgated hundreds of rules in the decade after it was created. OSHA's rulemaking process has, however,  slowed to a trickle  since then. 
 While the  National Institute for Occupational Safety & Health  recently identified over 600 toxic chemicals to which workers are exposed, in the last 16 years OSHA has added only two toxic chemicals to its  list of regulated chemicals . This is because Congress, Presidents and the courts have hamstrung OSHA. For example, in March 2001 the Bush Administration and a Republican Congress effectively  abolished OSHA's ergonomics rule , a rule the agency had worked on for many years. 
 
 These delays and inactions have caused more than 100,000 avoidable workplace injuries and illnesses. 
 
 These delays and inactions have caused more than 100,000 avoidable workplace injuries and illnesses . Workers are being injured and killed by known hazardous circumstances and OSHA can't act. 
 Congress and the President need to break this logjam - we need to free OSHA to do its job of safeguarding workers. 
 Prior results do not guarantee outcomes. 
Attorney Advertising.
