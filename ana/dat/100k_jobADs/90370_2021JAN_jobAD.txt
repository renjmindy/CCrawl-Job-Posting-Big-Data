 ARIES 
 Love  - You are quick to jump to your partner’s defence; you will not have those you love criticised or attacked in anyway and this may also include clashing with your in-laws on your partner’s behalf. 
 Career  - You tend to go with your heart today; even if what you do does not make sense, if it feels right them it is good as far as you are concerned. Aries do well when they act on instinct and that is what you are doing now. 
 Health  - Today your health can change fast; headaches come n quickly and ten disappear and so do aches and pains. If you start feeling rough, do not be too concerned it will pass. 
 TAURUS 
 Love  - This is not a time when you take things lightly and so nothing will be ignored; you will react and delve deeper even if what was said was intended to be a passing comment. 
 Career  - You have to analyse deeply what you are trying to achieve in any given situation especially if it involves dealings with others; if you are vague about your motivations, you may end up creating a web of unhelpful actions that oppose eachother. 
 Health  - Even if you feel strongly moved or affected by an issue, it is best to remain detached if it does not affect you directly, or else you can become totally submerged in the resulting emotions to the detriment of your own life. 
 GEMINI 
 Love  - In love you have to get your ego out of the way; Gemini are making team work and growth of the relationship impossible as you are too wrapped up in your own perspectives. 
 Career  - This week brings many opportunities to shine with your communication and language skills, and so when thinking ahead make sure you are taking every chance you have to speak and present your ideas and perspectives publically. 
 Health  - The effect of the sun (as a planet) brings fast recuperation and renewed zest for projects and initiatives of self improvement and empowerment. 
 CANCER 
 Love  - Relationship can be hard work right now and the effort you are putting it will take time to pay off and so stick with it and keeping believing. Cancer will be asking: what is love and what does it really mean for me. 
 Career  - This is a week of important milestones on the way to you main goals for this and next year; the main challenge is to keep momentum going after each milestone not slacking off to wallow in the achievement. 
 Health  - Cancer need to avoid the sun and also to pace yourself if it is very humid where you live or work – not a day to take on the weather, don’t be a hero and toil in the midday heat especially. 
 LEO 
 Love  - Your partner may be making increasing demands on you and while you have been happy to oblige it is now beginning to feel like one way traffic and you need to act now to stem the flow,. 
 Career  - Your opinions, no matter how valid and true can get you into hot water and so spend more time evaluating the mood and sensitives of others before wading in. 
 Health  - Leo are easily bored today – it is a good day to multi task and allow yourself to flit from subject to subject dipping into each to get a flavour rather than nailing yourself down to one topic or task. 
 VIRGO 
 Love  - Idle gossip can cause trouble in your relationship (especially if you are newly attached or dating) and so make sure you disregard hearsay and get to the source. 
 Career  Take the initiative and step up a campaign if you sell products via social media, but keep the ball rolling after contact with new clients or potential clients is established as the personal touch is vital in money making today and this week. 
 Health  - There is a strong desire for reform and change, and that does not only apply to you, but to everyone around you. You may decide to get fit and then twist the arm of your partner or siblings to join you and improve their health at the same time. 
 LIBRA 
 Love  - A time when making a tough decision in love can actually leave you feeling freer and with less guilt than you imagined. Say what needs to be said and the outcome may be very different to what you expected but in a good way. 
 Career  - It is time to either fully commit to a course of action or ditch it – if your heart is not in something now, it will not work despite all the effort you put in. 
 Health  - To attract what you want you have to give something up – brining in the new means letting go of something either physical or psychological or even habitual that has lost real purpose for you. 
 SCORPIO 
 Love  - Scorpio are driven by a need to change people and remake them in your own image; the biggest challenge for you is acceptance and letting the cards fall where they may. Let up on this need to influence and enjoy the randomness of others and their perspectives 
 Career  - You must try and not let your own personality interfere with sound judgement – business is not always about you, it is about what works whether you like it or not. 
 Health  - Scorpio love to test their boundaries and this leads you to be extreme a times, emotionally extreme. Living on the edge or pushing the envelope makes you feel alive, but it can take over your life and warp your sense of reality. 
 SAGITTARIANS 
 Love  - The need to be right and to lecture can be getting in the way of effective communication; Sagittarians often do not realise how much they adopt a morally superior attitude. 
 Career  - You could be dabbling in intricate and exciting new projects and you will have a chance to gain experience of new industries as well as take on extra responsibility. 
 Health  - A desire not to let people down can lead to a full plate and a mad rush – ask how you prioritise and who reality deserves your time as you are not being discerning enough in this. 
 CAPRICORN 
 Love  - Capricorn hate to be a burden and you are annoyed at yourself when you ask favours, but often the partners you chose really want to help and they enjoy it when you show a vulnerable side. 
 Career  - You get very annoyed when you are disrespected or when your authority in a mater is questioned, but you need to brush this off today and move on; let it go, it just is not that important in the scheme of things even if it feels so now. 
 Health  - The key to your own happiness is not allowing the struggles of others to occupy your mind to a greater degree to the ability you have to practically or morally assist them. 
 AQUARIUS 
 Love  - Love opportunities can be kept at bay due to this crippling self doubt you have now – you really are not seeing yourself in perspective and you try too hard making a hash of things. 
 Career  - Stop obsessing; you have done great and yet you keep trying to pick things apart and wonder where you could have done better. 
 Health  - Aquarian men, especially men rather than women today, are trying to make everyone around them happy, but in doing so you are showing no loyalty so spread your love more strategically. 
 PISCES 
 Love  - When in company of potential partners, do not be afraid to show you zany, quirky creative side even if you are in a work situation – use your flair and humour no matter where you are, even in the dry cleaner or supermarket and love can bloom. 
 Career  - You are easily distracted today and so if you want to get anything done remove your phone, shut the door or discourage conversation and close down any webpages not totally related to your main activity. 
 Health  - Pisces often tend to think things are permanent and yet nothing ever is, the planets keep moving and we keep growing into new circumstances with opportunities for change.

 ARIES 
 Love  - Only dynamic relationships and those which allow freedom, total self-expression, and are not judgemental can thrive this month. 
 Career  - Aries are likely to clash with institutions – your own attitudes are likely to be at odds with prevailing rules and regulations being pushed down your throat, and you are never one to take things lying down. 
 Health  - This is an extremely restless day and you need to have a vista before you either physically or emotionally where you can just run forward to embrace possibilities without feeling trapped or boxed in to a way of being or feeling. 
 TAURUS 
 Love  - Experience (hard earned) is a key factor in your success in love, can you use past experiences in a helpful way and you can draw on that experience to make constructive changes to your attitudes about sex and intimacy. 
 Career  - There is a great deal of to-ing and fro-ing today, and you will be more visible in your workplace and even in your neighbourhood as many new activities demand your attention. 
 Health  - Taurus have greater courage, and your willpower is not only stoic as per usual for Taurus but more assertive and decisive. Tackling a situation that causes you anxiety, can give you a great boost and so no avoidance strategies as they feed fear. 
 GEMINI 
 Love  - Take time to think back to all your relationships and review patterns that repeated and indeed are repeating in your current relationship and take responsibility for these. 
 Career  - If things are not working out as you would like then embrace the road less trodden and you look to buck the trend and plough a new course. 
 Health  - This can be a time when you slip into bad habits and so be mindful of what you are getting into as right now habits (both physical and mental) are like a warm bath; easy to get into and hard to get out of. 
 CANCER 
 Love  - Debates are more heated today and this weekend as those you oppose (ex partners or current partners) put up a fight – never assume anyone you come up against is a walkover, and so prepare well. 
 Career  - On a one to one basis, you have great charisma, and even if you interact online via direct selling or via YouTube, you have a personal touch. 
 Health  - Positive changes can take many forms right now and may involve physical or mental changes. The idea is that any lifestyle change can eventually become holistically beneficial even if it starts as a change to only one part of life. 
 LEO 
 Love  - Right now is a chance to take back ground you gave away for the sake of peace, harmony, acceptance, and love – if taking that ground back threatens the relationships, then there are serious questions about what the relationship is founded on. 
 Career  - The energy today is perfect for all Leo in artistic and expressive fields as you have added originality and flair. 
 Health  - It is said that a day without laughter is a wasted one and so make sure you introduce into your day that which makes you laugh and gives you an excuse to be silly and carefree. 
 VIRGO 
 Love  - New relationships can get deep quite quickly with you both providing a stabilising and anchoring force for each other. 
 Career  - Higher learning is emphasised, and many Virgo may embark on higher education weekend seminars or travel in order to pursue an interest, i.e., travelling to experience something in nature, travelling to a science fair, or travelling in order to advance a language skill quickly. 
 Health  - Haste can lead to lack of concentration in the moment and accidents, watch out. 
 LIBRA 
 Love  - This is a very good Friday for young relationships, romance, and also for marriages, but it is not such a good time for blind dates or speed dating events. 
 Career  - You may find it harder to gain recognition or fulfil an ambition if a woman or women are part of the approval or application process or overseeing you. 
 Health  - This is not the most favourable day for sporting competitions; succeeding means you have to dig deep or perhaps concede you are not quite ready yet and need to put more training in. 
 SCORPIO 
 Love  - Love and hate are strange bedfellows today and relationships can swing between the two extremes. Love is all about being challenged and being pushed to extremes. No drama, why bother? 
 Career  - Embrace change and even pre-empt it; whatever the status quo is, it is now clear it will not last, and something needs to change. 
 Health  - Scorpio may seek out a psychic or have a tarot reading – you may even seek to be more involved in the occult and to learn to enhance your own psychic abilities. 
 SAGITTARIUS 
 Love  - Empty gestures and half hearted actions will not cut it; if you cannot muster the emotion, leave it ‘til another day as with no heart and soul in it, it will be a damp squid. 
 Career  - To grow your business now, you need to focus more on what you do best and bring in people who have great track records in managing the parts of the business you are weaker in or have less affinity with. 
 Health  - Admitting defeat now and moving to a different tactic is vital if you are not conserve energy and even avoid injury. 
 CAPRICORN 
 Love  - You are good at lifting the mood and focusing on the positives; Capricorns can inject some much needed moral and and ‘can do’ feeling int th relationship. A good time to tackle a shared problem (especially regarding an enemy) and make some inroads into it. 
 Career  - You are the ideas leader in your workplace, and you can inspire others to look beyond petty differences and focus on common goals and exciting new directions. 
 Health  - You have extra emotional energy and this is used to motivate others around you and to improve the general mood of those close to you. Your focus now is more about maintaining control rather than pushing forward. 
 AQUARIUS 
 Love  - Your restlessness and need to keep moving can make it hard for you to get on with others’ making family relations strained and a little volatile. 
 Career  - You feel compelled to take action, almost as if to take no action would be to fail, and even though you may not always have a clear grasp of where you are headed, you feel good so long as you are moving. 
 Health  - You need to have your own way; it is not a time when compromising does you any favours as you are unlikely to be able to move on and will keep regretting a decision made to meet someone half way. 
 PISCES 
 Love  - You tend to be very forgiving, and you want to help rather than pass judgement. You tend to realise that many issues need more understanding and less criticism. 
 Career  - It is a very good time to work on inventions and innovative products and gather information that may be crucial for the final outcome. 
Pisces may travel to science and technology expos or to conventions this weekend where you exchange ideas with those at the cutting edge of your industry. 
 Health  - Sometimes nostalgia can be an anchor which ties you to the past, time to wake up and break the spell a person or place has over you and escape.

 ARIES 
 Love  -Be decisive and do not wait for your partner to do what you have asked - if it matters, do it yourself to ensure it is done. Unilateral decision making could be the only way to take advantage of an opening. 
 Career  -Fight not flight Aries - it is not enough to stand your ground you must be assertive and confident in expressing your viewpoint and keeping any advantage you have. 
 Health  - Be careful in the way you use machinery or equipment, read the instructions properly as in your haste to crack on you can waste time and create more damage.

 Health  - Health is good and there is energy available to aid healing and recovery. Gemini have extra oomph on the sports field, especially in team sports. 
 CANCER 
 Love  - It is not good to repress anger; if you are with a cardinal sign you are better off letting it off in a short sharp bust and dropping it, if you are with another water sign, don't bother they will want to dwell on it all day and it ain't worth it. 
 Career  - Energy is about to shift from plans to implementation and so thinking about it is over, proof will soon be in the pudding as plans go live and action serious begins. 
 Health  - You may need some time alone today, just to be your own person and not have to please or cow tie to others, often just 30 mins makes a massive difference. 
 LEO 
 Love  - Love means sharing, it does not mean sharing everything and Leo do need to be less intrusive as even when you do not mean it you can be very intense and like an all seeing eye. 
 Career  - Long term plans need a shake up - events may have superseded the plans you had and so you need a revaluate and little adjusting otherwise it could get confusing. 
 Health  - Use the energy you have today to do something which you feel counts; do it for you and only you. 
 VIRGO 
 Love  - For your eyes only - Virgo have a special measure of fire and passion reserved for their partner as they seek to reinvigorate the sexual element of the relationship. 
 Career  - Often you can only take on board so much information when the mind checks out, the emotions check in and you go for a decisions for better or for worse - heck, you will make sure it works out either way. 
 Health  - A time when Virgo may throw caution to the wind; you are impetuous and driven by gut feel. You desire for excitement and drama can make you quite hard to know how to handle. 
 LIBRA 
 Love  -Issues of control, domination, aggression and temper come into the relationship arena and while that could be fun if you like S&D, it could also be a stressful time when you cannot withdraw or capitulate without setting a dangerous precedent. 
 Career  - Say you have gone away and have no cell signal – really Libra, some at work are just taking the mickey, let them call someone else to do the work. 
 Health  - Try and stay calm, use you coping mechanisms and retreat to a mental or physical space where you feel calm and can think strait. 
 SCORPIO 
 Love  - Love life is about to come out from the shadows and again be a key part of your life, one that brings joy, support and needed respite from a cruel world. 
 Career  - Anger is deeply felt right now and often this is a good thing as that anger can be a call to action to make you more pro active is an area of life where you should be making changes or standing up for yourself.

 ARIES 
 Love  - Give and take is vital in love and Aries should not assume what their partner wants or even assume that because you have always done it one way that way is still relevant, it may have become stale and even a turn off and so look at new parameters and routines sexually. 
 Career  - Time to bring financial negotiations to a close; if any financial discussion or haggling is dragging out, this may be the time you walk away – surprise your opponent and tell them you’re done. 
 Health  - Look deep and look below the surface for solutions to problems and get at the root cause, which as is indicated can be in mental issues or anxiety. 
 TAURUS 
 Love  - The hardest thing right now is getting the mx right and it can be hard to judge how and where to draw the line between the selfish side and the people pleasing side; remember if you energy is low and you feel disconnected it is probably because you have not been selfish enough. 
 Career  - This is a period when Taurus need to access how well you are working with certain people or teams and you should start drawing to a close projects that are stagnating and where you can now see that you are not clicking with the others on the team. 
 Health  - While you crave company, being alone can be the best thing for you as you need some space and time without being bombared by the overt and covert messages others send out about what they expect from you. 
 GEMINI 
 Love  - A desire to reform can make you rather unpredictable; you are all about addressing problems and sometimes that means you make observations that may make a partner feel criticised or judged, but how can anything improve unless you indentify the cause. 
 Career  - Bad working practices have to be outed right now and so it is time to put an end to anything which is part of your work day that lacks purpose, is shoddy, has become redundant or which is just not helping productivity. Get rid of an old computer or even old software and welcome in some brand new systems. 
 Health  - Full moon in your 6th house brings about a tipping point and as it is conjunct Jupiter it will be big and bold; “To hell with it,” you shout as you pour away that fizzy drink, sign up to a gym or even tell your boss to go to hell as you make a big change for the better. 
 CANCER 
 Love  - Attending to the bigger goals or more pressing targets you have may have left little scope in your life for new pleasurable activities and so today you need to start spending that leisure time wisely and either seeking to ramp up romance or just doing stuff you used to enjoy together with a partner or alone which seems to have gone by the wayside. 
 Career  - Know when to quit while you are on top and this goes for business activities, sporting and creative ones – you have peaked and now you need some caution. 
 Health  - Today you have to learn to be strict as a parent; you have to know where to draw that line and say ‘no’ as it is likely that lax boundaries have led to the parent child relationship getting skewed in favour of the child who is pushing you too far. 
 LEO 
 Love  - An influential or more experienced individual in your field may have an unusual proposition for you, watch out they may be toying with you via your ambition. 
 Career  - Leo will find out soon how your recent efforts in connection with advancing you reputation, winning approval from superiors and job applications have gone, you should not second guess the outcome or pin your hopes on one thing – there is good stuff in store but it may work out differently from what was expected. 
 Health  - Any chore or family matter you have no attended to will come to a head now – this is a ‘chickens come home to roost’ phase and Leo need to start tackling these chickens not ignoring them. 
 VIRGO 
 Love  - There is a pause, no, not an emergency stop with burning rubber on the tarmac, just a chance to step off the dance floor and observe, take things in, gather your thoughts, and gain some insights that will help you carry on in a way that is more considered. 
 Career  - Try not to get cornered by one person who wants to bend your ear or who is trying their best to convince you of something, you need broad perspectives now and so even if you skip around picking up titbits of info here and there, it will give you a better picture than focusing on one narrow line of enquiry. 
 Health  - You will be burning off the calories today as you rush about juggling many balls and trying to catch up on things – keep hydrated with mineral water and try and eat a banana or grab a green smoothie for a long burst of energy. 
 LIBRA 
 Love  - This is a day when Libra need to come to terms with how their needs are being met in love – sometimes you just cannot get everything you want from a partnership no matter how good and you need to know how to love, nourish and approve of yourself. 
 Career  - It is a day for seeking comfort zones, you are more risk averse and while you can make good business and money decision they will not be very radical and may not have long term consequences. 
 Health  - Gentle, low impact exercise has the most benefit; you should avoid anything strenuous or extreme. This a time to listen to your body and work with its natural rhythms never forcing. 
 SCORPIO 
 Love  - This is a very flamboyant time for Scorpio – you are louder and prouder and should not be modest, you should demand attention and you must assume a dominant role in terms of sex life and the emotional life in the partnership. 
 Career  - Time to test ideas – put the ship out to sail and see how it fares in the high seas. A time where notions and philosophes must be tested in real world scenarios. 
 Health  - With Jupiter in your 1st activated by a full moon Scorpio can surmount obstacles and you can make the impossible possible and so time to throw away the rule book and go for what you would normally fear. 
 SAGITTARIUS 
 Love  - This is time to own up to what has been lurking beneath the surface; you may not be ready to talk to your partner about it, but you need to at least be more honest about it internally. 
 Career  - This is an excellent period for Sagittarians who work in finance and investment as you can perceive the hidden potential in many investments others may overlook. You are quite canny when it comes to reading the markets and understanding trends. 
 Health  - You are in the home strait – you should hold back, take a deep breath and ask yourself, “Am I ready?” Soon you will be tested to see if everything you have been doing up to now in terms of fitness and diet has paid dividends and panned out as you expected. 
 CAPRICORN 
 Love  - The role you play in your spouse’s life is highlighted and you may find that your ability to be positive and provide insight to your partner’s problems at work or emotionally matters more than affection. 
 Career  - Things are about to get very busy and you will be asked to act out of the scope of your experience, do be careful when you are in new territory as you could be over confident and miss a pitfall. 
 Health  - You are entering a phase where you will be more in demand in your social circles but from a mothering or advice giving role and so if you are not up for that, avoid the phone and resist any clingy behaviour from friends. 
 AQUARIUS 
 Love  - Sometimes someone does not mean as much to you as you thought – a romance that was recently all consuming can disappear in a puff of smoke. 
 Career  - Time to just stop for a few minutes an think about where you are an how you can capitalise on your position and you may be in a unique time and place today and you need to recognise that. 
 Health  - It can be hard to take a new step now; Aquarians are rather stuck in a rut and even though you know you are forming some bad habits you may not be able to do anything about it right now as you head is not in the right space for disciplined action. 
 PISCES 
 Love  - Pisces are a surprise element in relationships – you are a dynamite package looking to up the anti and burst any bubble of complacency that has set in in terms of sex or daily life. 
 Career  - You are not working with reason right now – you like to work on impulse and let the mood or emotion grab you, this can help you adapt fast in people driven environments, but can hold you back if you are in with very regimented people, set in their ways. 
 Health  - Positive thinking and also using you mind to direct energy to the various parts of your body which need healing or which you are working on in the gym, can be very powerful and so see that white light entering the body part you want to see an improvement in.

 Daily Horoscope April 29, 2018

 0 
 ARIES 
 Love  - Be more aware of the psychological issues at play; look for hidden motivations, and always take account of what is behind the mask of others you deal with. 
 Career  - In new business Aries need to look at matters deeply, analysing the facts, looking for more facts and being highly critical of any gossip or misinformation which comes your way. 
 Health  - Water sports and dance can be excellent ways to relax and get your endorphins going, Aries should avoid those sports which are hard on the joints. 
 TAURUS 
 Love  - Couples who are very socially active and who spend time around friends and going out will have fewer problems as Taurus can burn off their abundance of energy in the wider groups rather than expecting one person to fulfil their needs. 
 Career  - Much of what is important right now is invisible to you – it may be that your boss is talking to people about your promotion or that you are being headhunted. 
 Health  - There is great impetus to get things in order, and you have the energy to focus on stubborn problems or tasks that need determination. A great time to iron out the most difficult creases. 
 GEMINI 
 Love  - The romantic menu is rather full this weekend with social events, intimate moments, deep discussions, humour, and new mutual friends, and so anything but boring. 
 Career  - Networking tends to get cluttered with people who are never really going to deliver, and you need to lose them so they do not end up obscuring your view of someone who can offer a complimentary service or some useful industry advice. 
 Health  - You need to take power back from the group and reassert who you are independent of any friendships or associations that you hang out with or sign up to. Individualism is the key. 
 CANCER 
 Love  - Time to get your partner around the table over a cup of tea (green or chamomile) and correct any misconceptions. Things often get thrown about during fights, and you think, “How the hell can he/she think that?” After the fight, you often forget to address it. 
 Career  - Money matters are subject to flux, and you should hold back on major decisions due to possible volatility in underlying issues. 
 Health  - You are very open to new ideas and will have quite a few red pill moments when you have realisations where the truth slaps you in the face, and you accept and start to live with a new reality. 
 LEO 
 Love  - You can become quickly irritated with other people especially sexual partners, and that is why you are best sticking to neutral subjects and focusing on activities rather than conversation. 
 Career  - Leo are business-minded, and this is a very productive period of building, getting the administrative details organised and gathering momentum. 
 Health  - Learning is not always something that happens quickly, or without effort; the most valuable lessons learned are the hardest, and that is what Leo are grappling with. 
 VIRGO 
 Love  - Virgo have a taste for the exotic in love, and if on the dating scene, those who offer you an insight into a different culture or philosophy will inspire. 
 Career  - Virgo can develop very strong relationships with children who you care for in a professional sense, and that can make your work with them extremely meaningful regarding their recovery or development. 
 Health  - Put more energy into play and pleasure, and while you don’t have to burn the candle at both ends, some partying does you good.

 Daily Horoscope April 11, 2018 
 Posted by  lisalazuli

 ARIES 
 Love  - It is a time of understanding the deeper psychological aspects that operate in the relationship and which drive many of the things you do or arguments you have – nothing can be resolved by looking at superficial day to day problems – you must unearth the key fears, insecurities, and desires that drive the more overt emotions. 
 Career  - Make sure you review any information you pay for or commission which is passed onto you to see how accurate or sensible it is. 
 Health  - How much effort do you put into talking sexy – forget the bills, the shopping lists and let your tongue do the work with some creative and stimulating sexual banter. 
 TAURUS 
 Love  - You may have fun and hang out or watch movies with your partner, but do you understand each other’s goals and support each other’s efforts towards those goals. 
 Career  - Charitable and humanitarian work gets a boost with Taurus able to rally support and create more momentum behind your goals to help or support others. 
 Health  - It may be that with time which has passed and the maturity you now have that events in the past make more sense and can be understood in hindsight and thus patched up and resolved. 
 GEMINI 
 Love  - This mysterious nature you have right now is highly intriguing in new relationships and creates an exciting aura around you that helps romance. 
 Career  - Family matters can be quite confusing, and it is better not to make decisions about home alternations, home moves, etc., as there are still changes coming which can alter the complexion of the decision. 
 Health  - Gemini need to ensure that you have a regular exercise routine, as well as a warmup/cool down routine, to help combat achy painful knees and joints! 
 CANCER 
 Love  - Issues surrounding your children can be a uniting force and can also help you and your partner remember what you have in common and what you both have to be grateful about rather than what pulls you apart. 
 Career  - Negotiations are intense and detailed but generally progress quickly and smoothly, but you should never underestimate the scale of information and of the work ahead. 
 Health  - Do not be complacent, as you could be in somewhat of a honeymoon period regarding a new diet or regime, results can stop coming in fast if you let up just a little. 
 LEO 
 Love  - It may not be the most spontaneous time in love, but it is consistent and pleasantly predictable with less drama and volatility, and you can make decisions and get stuff done. 
 Career  - They say that punctuality is the courtesy of kings and the politeness of princesses and so be on time and be sharp to impress you superiors. 
 Health  - While you cannot teach old dogs new tricks, what you can do is adjust your filters so that you take some of the things people do less personally and reflect their negativity away. 
 VIRGO 
 Love  - Virgo need at least one person with whom they can share everything: a friend, mother, or lover, and if you have no such person, that could be the root of discontent and unhappiness. 
 Career  - You have a knack for handling a very wide variety of tasks without becoming scattered. Be careful of what you say ‘yes’ to as some seemingly simply jobs can become quagmires of detail and contradiction that get you tangled up for hours and days, not always productively. 
 Health  - If someone your care about has a problem, do not assume you can get them out of it; it may be wise to steer clear of it altogether. 
 LIBRA 
 Love  - You should think twice before ending a friendship over a disagreement; it is probably not half as bad as you think it is, and you need time out rather than a break-up. 
 Career  - It can be hard work bringing others around to your thinking, and you must try and inject more positivity and make the arguments less dry and more colourful. 
 Health  - Because your actions are governed by your instincts during this period, you may be especially defensive and protective. You may work hard at making yourself feel more secure, and you may be called upon to take charge on the home and family front. 
 SCORPIO 
 Love  - Scorpio are more assertive in your interaction with your partner and debates can become quite heated – you have a knack of zoning in on what is most crucial and can be quite blunt at times. 
 Career  - Scorpio are likely to be suspicious and you can almost bring out the devious side of others if you choose to focus on it. If you believe someone is out to get you, you will almost engineer a situation where that is confirmed to you 
 Health  - Communication and running errands are emphasised, and you can burn off the calories just doing the admin chores of the day. 
 SAGITTARIUS 
 Love  - Effort and commitment are key to any plan you have to restore a realtionship, not to mention patience which you need a large dose of. 
 Career  - You are a rebel right now, but often a furtive one. You may appear to play the game and toe the line, but you have other ideas 
 Health  - Avoid the phone, conversations can spiral into things you never expected and do not really want to deal with. 
 CAPRICORN 
 Love  - Single Capricorn can be too impatient to develop any meaningful new connections; you tend to discard people too quickly in your haste to move into the next one – perhaps you just cannot bear commitment or anything that may limit or stifle you right now and are keeping your options open …wide open. 
 Career  - Expectations run high, and yet it is better to temper your enthusiasm for new ventures and recalibrate – know who you can really count on and make sure their assurances are backed up with some action. 
 Health  - Health is very much about taking personal responsibility – no one can do it for you and how little or how much you do to improve health or cut back on junk food is a ball in your court. Limit diary over the next month. 
 AQUARIUS 
 Love  - You must make allowances for imperfection, but you must not make excuses for repeated bad behaviour especially where there was an obvious pay off for your partner. 
 Career  - You are more powerful when you join forces with a partner even on a temporary basis – you may unite with a former enemy to confront a new threat. 
 Health  - You thrive off company right now and even if things are tense and not exactly carefree or fun, you prefer that to being alone. 
 PISCES 
 Love  - Do not give up too much ground now as it can be harder for you to reclaim that later, especially if things get more contentious. 
 Career  - It is an ideal time to think about adult education and about heading off to college to update skills, add to skills or even follow a fresh new avenue that could open up doors regarding career. 
 Health  - Pace yourself more and try and listen to your body – know when to slow down. Often there is more resistance this month and so what usually takes a small amount of effort can take more; nothing is as simple as it seems.
