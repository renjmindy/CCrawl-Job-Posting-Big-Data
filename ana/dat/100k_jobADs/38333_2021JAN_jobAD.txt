 The Workiva Intern Experience 
 September 15, 2020 
 Allison Zobel 
 This year Workiva saw its largest intern class to date with 165 interns in 23 departments across 9 office locations in 3 countries! Our interns bring fresh skills, perspective and talent to their teams and are a valuable part of our company and growth strategy. When Workiva moved to 100% remote work in March, we were able to transition to a fully virtual internship program and continue to provide our interns with a valuable experience. 
 The goal and focus of our internship program is to create professional development opportunities catered toward building future career readiness skills. During their time at Workiva, interns are fully embedded in their teams and gain real work experience in various aspects of the business. Some activities that interns might experience include learning XBRL tagging (a government-mandated process for all public companies), coding in our production environment with the opportunity to receive patents for their work, and supporting clients directly by conducting client demonstrations. Our interns directly impact the success of Workiva and our platform. Here are some of my favorite quotes from intern managers: 
 “  We couldn’t have asked for better interns this year! They have stepped up to the challenge of working remotely and are excelling in anything we throw their way. They have helped us remain on track with our project work to reach goals we otherwise may not have, and they have been a huge help. Our interns feel like a part of the team.  ” — Manager on the Infrastructure team 
 “  From day one, my intern jumped in and moved the needle for our department. They have helped with updating job descriptions, analyzing/nomalizing massive data sets, and conducting market research for trends to elevate our processes and deliver for Workiva.  ” – Manager on the Compensation team 
 “  Our interns not only participated in our Agile processes and learned new development tools and languages, they also contributed as full-time members of our team. From creating new interactive training content to improving our portal’s search results, our interns helped us deliver all of our commitments on time.  ” – Manager on the Developer Efficiency team 
 Interns also learn about the day-to-day work of teams outside their department through “lunch & learn” presentations and other virtual workshops. Whether it is an Inclusion in Business discussion from our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Director, or a resume workshop with Talent Acquisition, interns have a variety of opportunities to explore the various aspects of Workiva and further their career development. 
 Interns work closely with their direct manger to learn about their role and the company, but as an additional learning resource, we coordinate group mentoring sessions. These sessions allow interns to talk about their career goals and learn about other areas of the company from their group leader – a full-time Workiva employee – and other interns. 
 At the end of the summer program each year, we celebrate our interns and their contributions with National Intern Day. Open to all employees, this year's day-long celebration included a Jeopardy game, Intern Program trivia and special Lightning Talk presentations where interns presented their various projects, hobbies and even showed off a few talents. Over the course of the day, the interns took over our social media accounts and shared some of their favorite experiences from throughout their internship: 
 
 “Workiva culture is exactly what I am looking for at a company. Everyone supports the growth and success of one another, and diversity is celebrated.”  — Jessie, Customer Success Intern 
 “My Workiva internship experience has been amazing. I have access to all the tools that allow me to make valuable contributions to the team. The atmosphere at Workiva has been awesome too! Everyone is supportive and welcoming and you have the opportunity to learn first-hand. The only time I feel like an intern is when I remember I have to go back to school in the fall!”  — Alexey, Software Engineering Intern 
 “Workiva has gone above and beyond to make sure we are set up for success this summer. They have been so helpful and make me excited to stay on in the fall. Not only has Workiva exceeded my expectations of a virtual internship, they’ve made it fun! From intern games to small group meetings, this company has made it so easy to fit right in and feel like I belong here.”  — Jazmine, Professional Services Intern
