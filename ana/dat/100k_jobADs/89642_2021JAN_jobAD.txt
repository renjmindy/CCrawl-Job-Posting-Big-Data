 We’re looking for motivated people to join our growing team. 
 Think you have what it takes to make hard work easy? Do you get excited about bringing new technology to market? Are you passionate about providing exceptional customer service? Check out our current job openings below! 
 Worksmith culture 
 We care.  At Worksmith, we love hearing stories from our commercial tenants about how we gave them peace of mind, and we love receiving notes from local service providers thanking us for new jobs. We work hard to deliver real value to our clients and service providers. We also care about each other. We have weekly stand-ups where employees share what they’re working on, as well as monthly all-hands meetings to discuss what the company has done and what we should do moving forward. We like the idea that fast-growing start-ups provide employees with an opportunity to grow in their responsibility, well beyond what their experience suggests, and we try to help employees take on new, challenging roles. 
 We work hard.  We know that our customers and providers are counting on us, and we take this responsibility very seriously. We take great pride in being a dependable resource to clients and vendors alike. That’s why we always ask both clients and vendors for feedback, and we have teams on hand to respond to issues at night and on the weekends. For us, it’s more than a job—it’s a partnership, and we’re in it for the long haul. 
 We have fun.  We like being in Austin for a reason: it is a delightful place to work and live. It is sunny nearly every day, and we take advantage of everything that Austin has to offer. We don’t just build camaraderie in the office—we also get out via company sponsored events such as water skiing on Lake Austin, taking an electric bike tour through East Austin, attending concerts downtown, and going to the ACL festival each October.
