 Caricature/Cartoon - Shahrukh Khan or King Khan wondering Bollywood ka King Kaun! 
 Shahrukh Khan (SRK) , the second Bollywood Khan to grace this blog with his caricatured presence, is a famous Hindi Film Star, who started his acting career literally from scratch, and became one of the most celebrated actor of Indian Cinema. 
 Here's my take on Shahrukh. He sits here contemplating who is the real King of  Bollywood  (and hence, King Kaun!) 
 
 Bollywood ka King Kaun? Aamir, Salman, or, I? 
 Shahrukh Khan's Shortest Biography on the Web: 
 Shahrukh was born on November 02, 1965, in New Delhi, India. Though he was born and then educated in New Delhi (completed school at  St. Columba's , graduated from  Hansraj College in Delhi University , and completed his post-graduation from  Jamia Milia Islamia ) he moved to Mumbai in 1991, after he lost his parents. Shahrukh (a Muslim) married  Gauri  (a Hindu) and he says that though he is a devout Muslim himself, his wife follows  Hinduism  - and the children follow both the religions (This can be really tricky, if you ask me…but don't ask me - ask him.) 
 Shahrukh Khan's Film-Career: 
 Guess the story began in Delhi, when Shahrukh joined the  TAG (Theatre Action Group - Barry John)  after which he acted in a television serial called " Fauji " in which he played the role of a commando. This was in the late eighties…and I remember people appreciating his work in the serial. 
 When he moved to Mumbai in 1991, he began his acting career with a movie called " Deewana" . Dewaana was followed by hits such as " Darr " and " Baazigar ". Unlike the other two Khans ( Aamir Khan  and  Salman Khan , who were his contemporaries) Shahrukh's initial movies cast him in semi-villainous roles. The movie that broke the villain-mold (which hadn't had the time to harden and so broke easily) was " Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge ". 
 Then came " Pardes " , " Dil To Pagal Hai ", and " Kuch Kuch Hota Hai ", and Shahrukh was established as a Star in Bollywood. 
 In the decade of 2000, among other movies, Shah Rukh Khan (SRK) gave us: 
 
 Mohabbatein 
 Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham 
 Asoka 
 Devdas 
 Veer Zaara 
 Chak De India 
 Om Shanti Om 
 
 This how Shahrukh Khan transformed into King Khan! 
 Shahrukh Khan's Six Pack Abs: 
 This post wouldn't be complete if I don't write about his six-pack abs, which he developed for his son Aryan and flaunted in the song Darde-disco in "Om Shanti Om". 
 
 According to Shahrukh: 
 “I decided to get ’sexy’ for a boy … my son. He kept telling me to go get a six-pack. He’d say that Salman,  Hrithik ,  John  were the ‘good physiques’. And even though I’ve always been fit, never fat, he wanted me to get abs, so I did. This one’s for him.”

 Watch the video of "Darde Disco" song here . 
 
 (Girls…stop drooling…we don't want to smudge his caricature - do we?)
