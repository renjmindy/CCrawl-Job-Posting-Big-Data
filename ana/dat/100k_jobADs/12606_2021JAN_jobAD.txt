 How To Land A Job In Sales 
 Here's some advice on how to  land a job in sales . 
 Interests 
 Before searching for any old sales position, always do a little research to figure out the kind of sales job that suits you best. The following is a list of things to think about before embarking on your career in sales: 
 
 Are there any particular industries that spark your imagination? 
 Do you want to work for a large, multinational company, an SME or a start-up? 
 Are you comfortable in an office environment where you will be committed to selling over the telephone, or would you rather sell in a field-based position, which might involve driving, walking or taking the bus frequently during your working day? 
 
 After you have figured out your preferred course of action you can start looking for your dream sales job! So what should you do to land the perfect job for you? 
 Look Online 
 Online Resourcing is an online recruitment specialist  in recruiting sales professionals across the UK. Oliver Adderley, Managing Director at Online Resourcing adds his view on the best way to find jobs in sales. “It’s now easier than ever before to find a job in the sales sector based on your location and requirements," says Adderley. "Do your research on the position best suited to you before making applications. Always use a job search tool to compare sales jobs in terms of descriptions and salaries.” 
 Build Your Network 
 As a huge network of professional people, LinkedIn has made it easier than ever to make oneself visible to potential employers. Create a profile, join sales-related groups and get involved in discussions to increase your visibility and to make yourself more desirable to your potential employers. 
 Fix Your CV 
 When sending your CV to possible future employers, make sure that it's geared specifically to sales, highlighting the skills that you possess which make you suited to a sales role by emphasizing your past achievements and experience within the field. Photo Credit:  Shutterstock
