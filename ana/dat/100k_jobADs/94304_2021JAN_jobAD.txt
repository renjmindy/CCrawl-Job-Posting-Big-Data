 Working with different groups of people is the norm. Many would claim that work gets done easier, and more work gets accomplished when working with a team. However, this doesn’t work for everyone. Working with a team needs constant communication with your team members to achieve the same desired result. For others, this can be exhausting. The constant in-person or even virtual meetings, the what seems to be endless exchange of emails, and the unexpected phone calls can make people who prefer working on their own worn out. This can only lead to little to no accomplished tasks. Good thing that there are a lot of options now. 
 ‎ 
 Nowadays, more and more jobs that can be done alone are available. Highly introverted people can find joy in making a living and advancing their career in the comforts of only themselves, or with minimal interaction with others. If you thrive in a solo-working environment, this list is for you. 
 ‎ 
 1. Freelancer 
 The freelancing world has a lot of jobs to offer. You can be a writer, a photographer, a videographer, and a graphic designer to name a few. These jobs allow you to work with clients on your own terms. You can opt to have a face-to-face interaction for business transactions, or just through emails. 
 ‎ 
 2. Writer 
 If you can weave words and form meaningful sentences in expressing people’s thoughts, then being a writer is the job for you. Companies and even individuals hire writers for many different reasons; some get hired to write copies for a company’s products or services, others get jobs for writing scripts for a podcast or even TV shows, and there are also those who are hired to write formal letters. As a freelance writer, you are free to choose the projects you would like to work on. This results in more productive work days, and less work-related stress. 
 ‎ 
 3. Photographer/Videographer 
 If you are gifted in seeing things from a different angle, perhaps being a photographer or videographer is the job for you. Similar to many other freelance jobs, you mainly communicate with your client; you also only accept jobs that you truly like. In this job, you are able to express and follow your creative process freely. Freelance photographers and videographers get hired for product shoots for small or big companies, advertisements, portraits or group photos of different individuals or groups. 
 ‎ 
 ‎ 
 4. Graphic Designer 
 If you are a one-man team that can produce a concept, and execute the design by yourself, then your interaction with others (except your client) will surely be limited. As a graphic designer, you have to work closely with your client. Although there are graphic designers who outsource some services, investing in different training and softwares is a must in this career. 
 ‎ 
 5. Online English Instructor 
 If you enjoy sharing your knowledge to others, then this job is for you. Teaching English online has been around even before, and has certainly become even more popular because of the pandemic. This job allows you to work one-on-one to small group classes with students from different age groups; you can have students as young as four years old to adults. These students live in different parts of the world who want to improve their English skills for school, work, or for fun. You can work through a company or on your own. 
 ‎ 
 One advantage of working through a company would be having a curriculum and books set-up. Whether you opt to work on your own or through a company, this job gives you more free time as you have the option to choose your teaching time. Do note that some training and certificates are needed in this line of work. 
 ‎ 
 6. Blogger 
 Aside from freelance writing, the world of blogging has certainly grown. More and more people enjoy reading different experiences before trying it themselves. If you enjoy sharing your experiences to others, perhaps blogging is for you. Choose a niche, set up your website, and write away. Bloggers earn from the ads that run on their website, as well as partnerships with different brands. 
 ‎ 
 7. Start a Youtube channel 
 If you are very much in touch with your creative side, why not try making videos on Youtube? Aside from reading other people’s experiences, the audience now also enjoy watching it; people enjoy watching song and dance covers, daily happenings, reviews of products, and many others. Similar with blogging, choose a niche, shoot your content, and post. Do note that it can take some time for your videos to be monetized as Youtube requires a certain number of subscribers and views before you can earn from them. 
 ‎ 
 8. Sell your art/products on Etsy 
 This job is for all kinds of creatives. Etsy is a site wherein you can sell your prints or handcrafted products like jewelry, household items, decors, and more. For crafters, you can make your products at home, and make a listing on the website. For artists, you can earn by making your pieces available online. Customers will have to pay a fee for them to download and print their own copies of your artwork. Do note that Etsy takes a fee every sale made. Make sure to read through their terms and conditions before starting. 
 ‎‎ 
 9. Virtual Assistant 
 This is among the popular jobs that can be offered remotely. The company can be in the western part of the world, but you can still work even if you’re from the east. Similar to freelancing, this job gives you a lot of free time; you have the liberty to choose when you’d like to work. If you’re a morning person, you can accept jobs set in the morning. If you are a night owl, you can opt to choose jobs offering night shifts. Like other jobs, this also requires training and some specific softwares. 
 ‎ 
 Do note that working alone does not necessarily mean completely zero interaction with others as you still need to talk to clients if you are a freelancer, and even if you are a boss of your own company; solo jobs still need interaction with others, just lessened person-to-person interaction.
