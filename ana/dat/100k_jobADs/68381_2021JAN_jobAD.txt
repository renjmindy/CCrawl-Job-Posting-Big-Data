 IoT Tribe accelerates the growth and adoption of disruptive technologies globally. As a trusted partner to corporates, government agencies, investors, startups, SMEs and other ecosystem players across industry verticals worldwide, IoT Tribe brings together communities where tech talent and partnerships can thrive. 
 We're looking to recruit a driven individual that can take our outstanding programme to new heights and help establish IoT Tribe as the go-to business accelerator for SMEs and scaleups and deeptech start-ups, investors and corporates. 
 This is an excellent opportunity to join a growing, successful and progressive company. This is a real chance to develop and grow your role within the company, where innovation, enthusiasm and hard work is recognised and rewarded. 
 The Role 
 Reporting to the Head of Partnerships, we are looking for an energetic intern with a can-do attitude to support our programmes. You will have a varied skillset and are expected to have demonstrated an interest in tech and entrepreneurship. 
 Duties will be varied and match the pace and needs of the programmes we deliver. They may include, but will not be limited to: 
 
 Scouting and creating a deal flow of relevant tech startups to join our acceleration programmes: reviewing profiles, shortlisting and outreaching to startups 
 Identifying opportunities and new initiatives to support the needs of our corporate partners and startups 
 Assisting in the development of the acceleration programme curriculum: shortlisting workshop speakers, mentors and coordinating schedules 
 Planning and organising the logistics for IoT Tribe events 
 Actively participating in the community management and marketing of IoT Tribe 
 Tracking & reporting the progress of startups within the Tribe 
 Identifying opportunities and new initiatives to support the needs of our corporate partners and startups 
 Assisting in the development of the acceleration programme curriculum: shortlisting workshop speakers, mentors and coordinating schedules 
 Forging partnerships that lead to growing our networks and reach 
 
 You are also: 
 
 Self-motivated: it's important you can organise and prioritize your own workload and successfully complete assigned tasks on time. 
 A team player: you can motivate others in a professional manner and lead by example. 
 An exceptional communicator: strong communication skills are essential as you will be responsible for liaising with and bringing together a large number of people, companies and organisations 
 Digitally literate: you have a thorough basis of computer applications used in the start-up or technology business, such as Slack. 
 
 You will also be a firm believer that women play a valuable role in technology and, whether you are a man or a woman, strive to make sure that women participate in the programme as founders, mentors, investors and supporters. 
 To apply please include your CV and a cover letter with salary expectations telling us why you are the perfect person to join us at IoT Tribe.
