 By Rebbekah Wiltons - August 17, 2018 
 
 Many people are dissatisfied in their career choices, but too many of us don’t take steps to rectify this. It is important to enjoy what you do, in spite of what people might tell you. You need to choose something you enjoy otherwise there is a risk you will become disillusioned with your life. There is a big, wide world out there, full of excitement, opportunity, and adventure, and you need to make sure you experience it as much as possible. 
 If you want to quit your job and go traveling, there has never been a better time to do it. Airfares are more affordable than ever, and the world is changing rapidly. Sometimes, you need to get away from things for a while before you can understand what you want to do. There are definite signs that you need to quit your job and go traveling, and you should listen to them - here are some of the most inescapable signs. 
 You’re bored 
 Boredom is the first sign that you probably need to get out of your current job and explore something new. There is such a variety of career paths to choose from, and there is nothing to say you need to stick with what you’re doing. If you are bored and feeling dissatisfied, it might be a definite sign that it’s time to quit your job, get on a plane, and expand your horizons. Life experience is so important, and traveling can really help you nurture your mind and body, and give you a better idea of what you might want to do with your life. 
 You long for fresh experiences 
 Many people, no matter what job they do, yearn for new experiences and want to make sure they take the time to experience all walks of life. However, being stuck in a job you don’t like or find fulfilling is one of the big things that might well make you seek out fresh experiences. If you often find yourself staring into space and imaging what is going on over the other side of the world, it’s probably time you found out. Quitting your job and going traveling will present you with the fresh experiences you have wanted for so long. 
 You want to do something completely new 
 Sometimes it might be the case that you have decided you’d like to do something completely different. People often make career changes, even later in life, and they often go in a totally new direction. You might not be able to do what you want to do where you are currently based; it might be a case of quitting your job and going traveling. You might find that if you go abroad, you’ll find the ideal career path for you. 
 You’re not growing 
 It’s important to grow as a person within your job role, and this comes down to how well the company is run, as well as what opportunities are open to you. Do you really want to spend 10 years in a job where you’re going to stagnate and not feel like you’ve grown as a person? Well, there are a lot of jobs in which this is the case, and this is the ideal time to quit your job and go traveling so you can spread your wings, and really grow as an individual. This is such an important thing that you need to take it seriously. 
 It’s important that you understand when you are not happy in your working life. Too many people are afraid to cut the cord and walk away from a job that is leaving them unhappy. These are some of the signs you need to look for that indicate you should quit your job and travel the world as soon as possible.
