 Work For Pleio 
 
 Pleio is a service that helps people take their medicine, their website is found at  pleio.com . 
 There are people who forget to take their medicine especially if they are starting out a new program or regimen to get themselves recovered. 
 Your work would be to help people stay on schedule. All you have to do is be one of their customer service people, who calls their customers and patients and reminds them to take their medicine. 
 It is mentioned on their website, that in the US, half the population fails to take their medicine as directed. 
 This is why Pleio from the GoodStart company is trying to change that. 
 The GoodStart program strives to provide patients with motivation, engagement when they need it to help them get to a good routine or schedule regarding their health. 
 Go to their webpage and scroll down to the bottom, and click on â€˜Careersâ€™

 This company will give you an opportunity to have a real job working from home. 
 Not only this, but you will also be able to make a difference in the lives of patients, you are going to be helping people. 
 You will also be able to find an 8 min video on their webpage which shows you how Pleio GoodStart works.
