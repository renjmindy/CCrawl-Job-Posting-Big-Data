 Improving data insights using Clojure in the Public Sector! 📈 
 Role overview 
 We’re looking for smart, motivated, thoughtful people to help develop our cloud-based data-publishing/analytics product ☁️. 
 **  Working at Swirrl ** 
 We’re a small company of 17 people, and while we’re considered by many to be experts in our field, we know we don’t have all the answers. So we’re looking for intelligent, thoughtful, effective people who are keen to learn from us and our customers and to bring their own ideas and experience to improve the way we work, how our product works, and ultimately how government data works to help society. 
 We have an informal open collaborative company culture, where everyone contributes. We love what we do. 💛 
 Until spring 2020 we had a small office in Manchester where about half of the team would work (the rest being remote) 🌍, but since lockdown we've 100% embraced remote and flexible working. We'll continue to monitor the Coronavirus situation but we hope to reintroduce social and work-oriented meetups for the team in 2021. 
 **  Technology ** 
 We use various technologies including those listed below. You probably already know some of them, but others you’ll be keen to learn. 
 
 Clojure(Script) 
 Git 
 Continuous Integration and Delivery (Travis, CircleCI) 
 Cloud computing (Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud) and monitoring (Datadog, Pingdom, Pagerduty) 
 Linux (including Containers) 
 RDF, Linked Data and Graph Databases such as Stardog 
 SPARQL and GraphQL 
 Ruby (we’re phasing out our Ruby components, but we still have some legacy) 
 Javascript (including React and D3) 
 Modern and accessible HTML and CSS 
 R and RStudio 
 
 **  Challenges ** 
 Some challenges we’ve solved and some we’re still working on that you might find interesting are: 
 
 How to present complex data so more people can interpret them, without adding your own bias 
 How to make agile development really work in public sector projects 
 How to serve gigabytes of graph data from a cache instead of the database whilst ensuring it’s correct and doesn’t significantly increase latency on the initial request 
 How to plan and orchestrate a complex phased site migration with minimal disruption of service 
 How to combine structured queries and text search to help people find exactly the right piece of data 
 How to make complicated data selection tasks seem easy (whether you’re on a laptop or a phone, for people with widely varying skills, regardless of any disability) 
 How to build isomorphic Clojure(script) applications 
 
 **  Benefits ** 
 😊  Flexible working  - everyone should have a good work life balance 
 🏖  38 days holiday including bank holidays  - take the bank holidays whenever suits you 
 💻  High spec laptop  - normally MacBook Pros 
 🖥  Working environment budget  - to allow you to work effectively from home 
 🌍  Diversity dedicated staff -  culture add is key

 We believe that making the best possible use of the web is the way to turn useful data into valuable insights 🚀. Swirrl's PublishMyData software platform helps government organisations to make their data more accessible and re-usable, enabling better informed decisions. 🔎 Transforming how government finds data PublishMyData wraps your data in world-class search, browse and discovery technology. Users can explore by topic, map and natural language search. Specialists can also use details of vocabularies and classification schemes to filter data or use the full featured query language for the most precise or complex search requirements. 🧠 Transforming how government understands data PublishMyData helps you annotate, cross-reference and document your data, making it self-describing. All your users can rely on common clear, precise and consistent definitions of every term in your domain, allowing them to apply data with confidence. Datasets can be illuminated and enriched with explanatory notes and details of methodology. 🔌 Transforming how government connects data PublishMyData weaves your data into a graph, breaking it out of silos and joining it to other data from inside and outside your organisation to enable new connections and new comparisons. 📈 Transforming how government uses data PublishMyData makes your data ready to use anywhere: combine data sources to create custom spreadsheets on the desktop; syndicate the data into offline systems; power online apps and visualisations. 🎛 Transforming how government manages data PublishMyData puts you in control of your data. Edit, transform, load, validate and publish your data in teams, or automate and integrate the process into code workflows. Be confident that your publishing is timely, trustworthy and reliable.
