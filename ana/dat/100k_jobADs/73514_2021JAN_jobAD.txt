 Heritage Futures 
 Historic environment and heritage management projects, resources, commentary and analysis by Profs Ian Baxter (Heriot-Watt University) & David Gill (UEA) 
 Heritage Careers Guide 
 We have been supporting students to get jobs in the heritage sector for many years, and Ian Baxter has now compiled a guide in association with The Heritage Alliance and the Built Environment Forum Scotland which aims to list a range of useful places to check for vacancies in the heritage sector. Feel free to pass it on to anybody who may find it useful! 
 The guide can be viewed online and downloaded  here , and will be updated regularly.
