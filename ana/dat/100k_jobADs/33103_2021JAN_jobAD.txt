 Too sunny? Make tea 
 Posted on  August 18, 2016  |  5 comments 
 Find the bright side to your problems. 
 The biggest argument against us moving to Van Nuys was the sun and heat. So I went to the dollar store and got this jug. Every day, I harness the sun to fight the sun. I make sun tea, chill it and enjoy it. The Valley Boy Pastor's church with the Christian Fellowship Ministries is coming along lickety split. 
 Embrace the city/marriage/job/ministry God has called you to. Find the upside. Use the bad things for good. 
 I love sun tea. What do you love about your ugly situation?

 Difficulties at Christmas 
 Posted on  December 25, 2015  |  7 comments 
 Sometimes I have to remind myself that God has everything under control. He's permitting the difficulties. He's shaping me. I don't understand. I can't see the big picture. Job didn't know about the cosmic bet between Satan and God. All he could see was a completely unfair and incomprehensible situation. 
 If you are going through tough times at Christmas, remember: they might be a gift from God. Of course, you wouldn't want this kind of gift. But you'll like the results when God has finished His product. So hang in here, don't lose heart. Thank Jesus for the difficulties.

 Outlasting stress and strain 
 Posted on  February 11, 2015  |  8 comments 
 Stress is the force exerted on the jet wing. Strain is bending to the elasticity limit; if it bends beyond that, it breaks. 
 My dad was the test engineer who discovered, with a torque rod, that the outside two wing cylinders would break on the F-104. But his superior thought faulty testing side load was to blame. So Lockheed skipped the redesign. 
 When the prototype flew, the same cylinders were compressed. The redesign, so late in the game, was much costlier. 
 We all have our breaking points, when too much stress is straining our hearts more than we can bear. Just like different materials and different designs have different load capacities, so too all of us have different limits. There's no point in making fun of me if my capacity to enduring stress is lesser than yours. 
 I want to spring back into the original shape. I don't want to be distorted by the strain of bitterness, disillusion, betrayal. God increase my elasticity!

 Don't despair over problems 
 Posted on  November 28, 2014  |  9 comments 
 Problems are God's way of leading you to something better. 
 If you are in God's kingdom, He leads you. Sometimes His leading is through painful circumstances. We don't like it, but we'll like the place where He brought us. Adversity is a path to bliss. 
 Job first suffered, then he was blessed. Joseph was a slave and then in jail, then he was blessed. Daniel was exiled from his homeland and forced into the king's service, then he was blessed. Before he became king, David was a fugitive in the desert. 
 Don't be caught off guard (as I have). Feel God's peace in midst of the turmoil.

 Credibility to speak 
 Posted on  January 20, 2014  |  5 comments 
 When he was serving God, Pastor Harold Warner suffered a car accident that left him in a wheelchair. Recently, he needed an amputation for a nasty festering infection. So naturally it hit like a tidal wave at Bible conference when he declared:  Through all the trials, I never doubted the goodness of God.

 When they screw with your mind… 
 Posted on  September 25, 2012  |  Leave a comment 
 
 from the movie 
 After defeating every apparent enemy in the  video game , Ender faces a mirror and sees his brother's face. He shrieks with horror. The message is clear: Ender, you're as cruel, ruthless, cold, calculating and power-hungry as Peter. 
 The video game is not the only thing to screw with his mind in _ Ender's Game , _by  Orson Scott Card . At every turn, Col. Graff stacks the odds against the  child genius  in his attempts to prepare a general to fight the alien buggers. He  is deprived of friends, allowed to be bullied, given the disadvantage in the battle room. Inevitably, he wins in the sci-fi story set to be a 2013 movie, but he chafes under the mind games. 
 It seems to me that God screws with our minds at times. Such is 
 
 Ender 
 the story of Job, who is deprived of knowing chapters 1 -3 of the book written about him that explains the bigger picture. It could have provided some solace. Such was the story of Joseph -- and a host of other biblical heroes.  All things work 
 
 Petra 
 _together for the good … _but when you're going through the trial, it's a mind game just to not explode. 
 So how does a child not turn to drugs when caught between parents in an acrimonious divorce? How do you keep outreaching zealously for God when your wife leaves you for no reason? How do you forgive when power-hungry church members accuse you falsely? 
 There is no easy answer. I personally like prayer. But what must be said is that an answer must be found. You must not burst 
 
 the book's author 
 under pressure. Grace must remain intact through the furnace trial. 
 I was a literature major. I have never read a book that addresses this theme. It made me think profoundly. It brought comfort. (Spoiler alert) In the end, the mind games prepared Ender to defeat the enemy.
