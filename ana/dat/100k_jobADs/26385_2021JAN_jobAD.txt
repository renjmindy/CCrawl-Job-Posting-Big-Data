 Darren Gwynn  and  Alex Botha  are two of Johannesburg's best fashion talents (well, Darren was until he decided to up and move back to London, where he assisted Rankin for a few years before coming back to Jozi - but he still returns for shoots). Darren shot me in the amazing Huf magazine  story  Uthuli Africa, and I've shot countless things with Alex. 
 They decided to collaborate on a beauty series a couple of years ago, and asked me to be the subject of one of their photographs. It's now been made available for sharing. 
 Note to anyone interested - white paint isn't solid enough to cover hair, and sudocrem coupled with powder works better ( but is a complete  bitch  to get out). 
 I love this pic. It turned out so nice! They really are a dream team.
