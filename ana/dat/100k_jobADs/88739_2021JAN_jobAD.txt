 JOHN LEWIS … CIVIL RIGHTS ICON 
 
 We have a mission, a mandate, and a moral obligation to speak up and speak out until the House votes to address gun violence. 
 We have turned deaf ears to the blood of the innocent and the concern of our nation. We will use nonviolence to fight gun violence and inaction. 
 Senator John Lewis 
 
 Democratic representative John Lewis called his colleagues to join him as he spoke on the House floor Wednesday< June 22, afternoon. 
 A few dozen traveled down the aisles and fanned out on either side of Lewis's podium as he began: 
 
 "What would bring this body to take action? What would finally make Congress do what is right, what is just, what the people of this country have been demanding, and what is long overdue? We have lost hundreds of thousands of innocent people to gun violence." 
 
 Lewis, who fought on the front lines of the civil-rights movement, delivered an impassioned speech about the need for action — for House Speaker Paul Ryan to simply allow a vote — on gun-control measures.

 About Dr. Rex 
 I'm originally from Puerto Rico. I was born in Santurce and raised in Rio Piedras. Have lived in Florida since 1999. I have a doctorate degree in Medicine; completed in 1976. My Internal Medicine specialty was completed in 1979. Worked for Puerto Rico's health system until 1985. At this time, I'm happily retired after working for the federal government for almost 28yrs. I want to offer any knowledge that I have to anyone "out there" who is interested. My views are liberal in almost every sense. My knowledge is "eclectic" - a bit of everything. Music and reading are my passion. Blogging has also become a very interesting endeavor. Metaphysical topics attract me. I'm interested in news reporting human issues like injustice, discrimination and abuse - the "wrongly" affected. My intention is to bring this knowledge to an understandable level and to help anyone in need. I'm open to questions and will answer them to the best of my ability. Currently working on an enterprise whose main mission will be to bring peoples of all walks of life together. To be one .... since we ALL are ONE!! The future looks bright and promising!!!

 One problem republicans have is that one proposal is that anyone on a watch list is banned from purchase. I understand the Obama has put all disabled US veterans on the list. The selection of who is on the list is very arbitrary. A person cannot know if he is on the list and has no due process to challenge and have name removed if not legitimate to be on list.

 Agree … the point for me is that something needs to be done. That the total obstruction of the last 8 years stop. Enough is enough …. have to start somewhere. My humble thoughts ….

 I agree. Even support fingerprinting and controls at gun shows. I don't own a gun, never have.
