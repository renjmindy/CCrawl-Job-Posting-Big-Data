   **Green, Cary J.**   _Success Skills for High School, College, and Career: Christian Edition Revised_ (First edition published in 2019, and revised edition published in 2020, both by Skills 4 Students LLC).  Successful students and employees have something in common—a well-developed skill set that transcends book smarts.  The purpose of this book is to teach young people individual life skills while reminding them of the Biblical principles which motivate the learning of each skill.  The fourteen chapters are divided into four sections—Readiness, Relationships, Results, and Academic Success Skills—and discuss such subjects as self-awareness, positive attitude, balance, context, communication, professionalism, synergy, mentoring, goal-setting, prioritization, critical thinking, accountability, academic success practices, and resources.

 _Success Skills for High School, College, and Career: Christian Edition Revised_ expands the best-selling _Success Skills for High School, College, and Career_ by incorporating scriptural references, Biblical examples, and a gospel-oriented theme. _  _Parents and teachers who want to equip students with skills and experiences essential for success in the classroom and on the job will find this book to be a great resource. _  _Kevin Cyprian, Principal of Newport Christian School, wrote that it “should be required reading for juniors and seniors in every Christian school."  Another reviewer who worked in college admissions for years said, “This is a book I highly recommend for all high school students (or their parents)!”  A 60-page application workbook is available as a free download from the publisher’s website.
 
 Author Cary J. Green, who spent twenty years teaching and advising university students, serving as director of a college-level recruiting and career center, department chair, and associate dean for academic programs before starting his own business, draws upon his own academic struggles early in his college career that forced him to make personal changes to attain his goals. I wish that a book like this had been available when I was a teenager. Now that I am 66 years old with a chronic, progressive, degenerative, neurological condition, it has little to offer me. However, it would make a great tool as part of a homeschooling curriculum to help young people in developing skills for both academic and career success.
