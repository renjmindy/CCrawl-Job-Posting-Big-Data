 Will This Program Work For Me? 
 Our program has helped  thousands  of professionals from  all over the world  gain employment, make career changes, or advance their careers. We accomplish this by combining courses, coaching, and community to form the best learning environment possible. 
 When you sign up for our Professional or Executive Level Subscription, you'll get access to a private community of professionals with similar goals, challenges, and experiences. You'll also get access to our coaching team as well as career-focused courses to help you with your job search or professional development. 
 Resume, cover letter, and LinkedIn reviews are all wrapped up into this subscription. You can submit  as many  materials as you'd like for review by our coaches, just as long as you're an active member. Please note that responses can take up to 2-business days, though. 
 Can you give me advice for my career or job search without me joining the program? 
 Please check out our blog as we post daily articles centered around career change, job interview preparation and more. However, if you are looking for advice from one of our career coaches, unfortunately that is only available to our paying members.However, if you sign up for our Professional or Executive Level Subscription, you can chat with a coach and get the support you need! 
 Our program has helped thousands of professionals from all over the world gain employment, make career changes, or advance their careers. We accomplish this by combining courses, coaching, and community to form the best learning environment possible. 
 When you sign up for our Professional or Executive Level Subscription, you'll get access to a private community of professionals with similar goals, challenges, and experiences. You'll also get access to our coaching team as well as career-focused courses to help you with your job search or professional development. The combination of these tools will allow you to learn the fundamental skills you need to achieve career success. 
 While we love our program, we know it might not be the right fit for every professional. You can also cancel at any time - there's no monthly commitment. 
 If you're interested in signing up, you can do so here.  
 What's the difference between the Professional Level and the Executive Level subscription? 
 Both levels have access to the same courses, content, and community, with the exception of certain Groups. The Professional Level has a variety of Groups and the Executive Level has one major group where information, videos, live office hours, and so on are posted. That information can only be seen by Executive Level subscribers. The Executive Level also has elite coaches who can help higher-level professionals with strategic planning, personal branding, and so on. This level is really geared toward c-suite and executive-level professionals who need high-level coaching, networking opportunities, and insights. For these reasons, the membership is more expensive because it's more hands-on. 
 
 Are there additional charges for services like career coaching or resume review? 
 No, you will never be charged anything other than the rate that you signed up for. All of our coaching, courses, materials reviews and access to our platform are included in the price you sign up at. 
 
 What is the difference between monthly and annual? 
 With our monthly subscription, you will be charged on the same day that signed up every month. This allows you to only make a monthly commitment to Work It Daily since you can cancel at any time. With the annual subscription, you will only be charged once a year on your sign up date. This allows you access to our club for an entire year. If you choose to cancel your annual subscription at any point, you will still have continued access to our club until your renewal date. At that point, you will be taken out of our system until you enroll again. 
 Do you work with people from other countries? (non-U.S.)? 
 Yes! Work It Daily is a global career growth club. We work with professionals and executives from all over the world. We have found that our techniques, with some minor tweaks, can work in any job market worldwide. When you join, just let our coaching team know what country your in or what country you want to find a job in, and they can help to tailor your career and job search strategy accordingly. 
 Are resume, cover letter, and LinkedIn reviews included in my subscription? 
 Yes.  As a Work It Daily member, you'll have the ability to send as many resumes, cover letters, and other career-related materials to our coaches for feedback. Resume, cover letter, and LinkedIn reviews are a huge part of the process! 
 
 How fast should I expect responses from the coaches? 
 We have a 2-business day turnaround on responses but we try our very best to get back to clients as soon as possible because we know many of those requests are time-sensitive. 
 
 Who are the coaches? 
 The coaching team at Work It Daily is personally trained by our head coach, J.T. O'Donnell, who has 15+ years of experience in HR, recruiting, and career coaching. They're all very knowledgeable in career growth and job search strategy, and work with hundreds of clients per week. They're also focused on staying on top of trends to make sure you're getting the most up-to-date guidance as possible. 
 How do I get in touch with my coach? 
 If you have a question or want something reviewed (i.e. a resume, cover letter, or LinkedIn profile), you'll need to log into the platform at club.workitdaily.com and start a Direct Message to your Coaching Team. 
 Professional Level Members  -- If you signed up for the Professional Level Subscription, please message Coaching Team - Professional Level. 
 Executive Level Members  -- If you signed up for the Executive Level Subscription, please message Coaching Team - Executive Level. 
 The turnaround on responses can take up to 2-business days (and we don't work on weekends). So, please keep this in mind. Please also take Federal Holidays into account. 
 How do I cancel, change, or upgrade my subscription? 
 If you want to cancel, change, or upgrade your subscription with Work It Daily, please follow the instructions below. 
 Switching Plans 
 You can switch between the annual and monthly plans by doing the following: 
 When you're logged in on the web, just navigate to Your Profile > Settings > Subscription. 
 Scroll down until you see the button that says Manage Your Subscription. Then choose the option to Change Subscription. If you decide to switch plans, this change will show up right here on that page. 
 PLEASE NOTE  : If you decide to change plans, the change will not go into effect until the end of your current billing cycle. So, if you're on the monthly subscription and want to change to the annual subscription, you'll be charged for the annual subscription at the end of your monthly billing cycle. However, if you're on the annual subscription and want to change to the monthly subscription, it won't change until the end of your billing cycle next year. In that case, it's probably better to cancel and resubscribe. 
 How to Cancel Your Subscription or Unsubscribe 
 You can cancel your member subscription and leave Work It Daily at anytime. To cancel, just log into your network on the web and go to  Your Profile > Settings > Subscription . On the next menu you'll see a button that says Change Subscription. 
 On the next page, you'll see an option to "Cancel your subscription" below the list of subscription plans on the network. Click on that link and confirm that you do indeed want to cancel, and then your subscription will be cancelled at the end of the current billing period.
