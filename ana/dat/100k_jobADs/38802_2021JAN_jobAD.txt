 New Year - Now What?   
 January 2, 2019/in  Careers  /by  Lori Beard-Daily 
 Happy New Year! It's 2019. Cheers! Here's to the New Year and New Beginnings! 
 For some of us, we stayed up til midnight to see the New Year come in, and others stayed up to make sure that the old year went away! Each year we have the same amount of days. It's 365 days no matter what year it is (unless of course it's Leap Year). The only difference is what we decide to do with our days . 
 So, what resolutions did you make this year? Setting goals is a great way to gain clarity. However, while goals are good, it's also important to have realistic expectations and acquire consistent habits that will help you to obtain your goal. If your goal is to make more money this year then you should start off by setting a specific and rational amount you want to achieve and work toward it. It doesn't matter if your amount is $5,000 or $50,000. Be honest with yourself about what's feasible and what consistent habits you will need to establish in order for your financial goals to come to fruition. Do you need to save more, work a second job or earn more money by getting a pay raise or applying for a different job that pays more? Basic questions like these are easy to ask yourself but sometimes more difficult to answer without a well thought out plan. 
 Remember, it's a New Year! There is plenty of time to make mistakes and start anew! Don't worry if things don't go as planned right away. The key is to just set the goal. Be realistic and start the plan. 1)Remember, be honest with yourself and your expectations. 2) Work on starting out with one goal at a time. This will help keep you from getting too distracted or overwhelmed. 3) Track your progress (this will help you stay accountable). 4. Ask for help if you need it. Sometimes it just takes another voice to encourage you and keep you on track! 
 Happy New Year! Welcome to 2019. It's Your Year! Make it a great one!
