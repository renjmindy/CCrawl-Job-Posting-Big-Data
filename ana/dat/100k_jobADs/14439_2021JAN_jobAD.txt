  Career Prep: Tell Friend Her Professional Weakness?  
 Work It Daily 
 October 27, 2012 
 Job search takes practice – just like studying for the SAT. That’s why we came up with daily  Career Prep  questions to help you “study” for your job search! Here’s today’s question: Allan has a best friend Felicity. They met at their first job out of college and worked together in the same department for five years. Recently, Felicity was  laid off . She has been looking for work for 9+ months. She is getting very frustrated and asked Allan if he thought there was something about her that was costing her the jobs she interviewed for (she’s been on five interviews so far). Allan does know that one of the reasons she was selected for the layoff was that she doesn’t communicate well with management. She is she around leaders and clams up. The shyness was being perceived as inexperienced and less competent by management, who felt she wasn’t as strong as the others who were more articulate and spoke up more. [poll id="75"] (  NEW!
