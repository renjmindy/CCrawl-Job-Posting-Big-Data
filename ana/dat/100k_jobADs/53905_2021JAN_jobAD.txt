 Is It Okay To Send A Follow Up Email After A Job Interview? 
 Written by  Matthew Coppola - Career Coach, Employment Specialist and Professional CV Writer Posted on May 11, 2020 2 Comments 
 You just had a job interview with an employer and you're feeling quite confident. Or maybe you're freaking out, carefully considering whether or not you performed well and what you could have said differently. 
 Frustrated You Didn’t Hear From Back From an Employer? You’re Not Alone. 
 It's a waiting game. You need to let the interview process proceed and finish. Once they have interviewed all shortlisted candidates (and let's face it, who knows how many people they actually interviewed) then they will discuss and make a decision about who gets the job. 
 The problem with the whole job interview process is that you never really get to know what the employer is going to ask you and what they're specifically looking for. 
 How long can it take to secure an interview? 
 But you may be wondering whether or not it's okay to send a follow up email to the interviewer thanking them for their time. 
 Well, for many, there are mixed views on this. 
 I think it's okay, but only if your email is super short and straight to the point. 
 Something like this: 
 
 Hi, Just a quick note to say thank you for the opportunity to be interviewed by you. Whatever the outcome may be, I look forward to hearing from you. Thanks. 
 
 So something short and sweet. No pressure whatsoever on the employer to make a decision sooner or in any way influence their decision-making. At the end of the day, you want the employer to hire you because  they want you  not because they felt compelled or pressured. 
 I believe it's a good idea to send a follow-up email because it shows that you're keen and enthusiastic about the job. A genuine, heart-felt show of interest can go a long way to making a difference. And of all the candidates that they may have hired, if there is any slight confusion as to hiring you over someone else, a simple email might just be the trick to push you over the edge to a yes to hiring you. 
 The best thing anyone can do is work on their interviewing technique. Learn about the art of the interview by  receiving one-on-one interview coaching   with an experienced coach will guide you and provide you with feedback. ** Client Centric Executive Employment Solutions  **offer this service and they do a great job at it.
