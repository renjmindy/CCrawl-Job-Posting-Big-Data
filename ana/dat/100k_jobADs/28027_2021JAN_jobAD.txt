 ASK 
 
 Regarding My New Career from Gentlemen Take Polaroids, you turned the beat around ( you performed the beat backwards ) after ghost notes in a fill . Was it a conscious decision or was it something spontaneous ? Was it something Mick triggered ? The drums sound very compressed . Do you remember finding the right compression for the drums? 
 Turning the beat around was a conscious decision. Messing with the downbeat was always a bit of a habit of mine and Mick would design bass parts to compliment this approach (‘Still Life In Mobile Homes’, ‘The Art Of Parties’ for example). In the case of ‘My New Career’ the beat turn around was employed to accentuated the chorus vocal line. 
 Drums sounds were generally heavily compressed in those days, it was a contemporary sound of that time. I wasn’t involved in sound engineering back then so it would have been the producers job.

 Next Next post: Hi Steve. I'm curious about the Japan songs that you may not have played on. I'm guessing "Despair", "Taking Islands…..". Were there others? What input did you have in the construction of songs which you didn't perform on?

 hi Steve, I have a question about the ownership of a piece of music. Some bands like Exit North are joint owner (except for the lyrics), but with Japan it's only one person usually your brother. I am curious what a tipping point and the boundary is. If you invented the drums yourself why aren't you the co-composer? I personally think that what makes Japan specific is the uniqueness of the drums and bass. For example Methods of dance would sound very different if Ringo Starr played it. I am convinced that if you perform solo I would have a fantastic night. Mick also had such a specific sound. I am curious how something like this goes. Did David also specifically indicated how to play the drums or bass? Regards Frank. The Netherlands. See you in Helmond next year.  September 22, 2020 
 Hi Steve I always wondered …. When you played in Japan( band) your drum position was always centre of stage and faced to the audiences. But You were on the right side of stage and faced to the centre of stage and looked other members in Exit North. I also saw you playing on right side of stage in other performances. What is the reason why you positioned there ? I’m sorry if this question were stupid to ask …  August 4, 2020 
 Lennon or McCartney (or - Harrison or Starr) ?  May 30, 2020 
 Though our tastes refine through the years, I've often wondered, especially after having just finished Mick's book. Do you ever, either for nostalgic purposes or not, still desire to throw on a New York Dolls or Alice Cooper record and listen to it? Clearly this isn't the most mature question compared to those on here, I was just curious. And if you choose not to answer, I understand. My question is more based on how much an artist still reflects and waxes nostalgia upon the music that influenced them in their formative years.  May 30, 2020 
 Hi Steve, loved the interview in rolling stone japan magazine,even with a dodgy google translate ! Good live pics of Exit North too. My question is why as a long term Tama endorser and being in their backyard so to speak you ended up playing a Yamaha kit ? Thanks Ross (Drum nerd)  December 10, 2019
