 PETRA LASZLO …. YOU ARE FIRED! 
 
 Just simply imagine … put yourselves in the shoes of a terrified child who doesn't have a clue why their world has been terribly changed. 
 Imagine the adrenaline rush of the adults, after going through all the journey to get to where they were. 
 Imagine being in a group of screaming and running human beings. 
 Imagine the sound of the policemen running after you to catch you and return you to the uncomfortable place you came from. 
 All that you know is gone, totally gone. 
 You see a possibility of getting away. 
 Getting away to where? 
 All that is out there is unknown. 
 You think you've made it, amidst all the screaming and running. 
 You can see and almost taste freedom. 
 Suddenly you feel yourself falling to the ground … all because this woman has extended her leg and has consciously tripped you. 
 All within seconds …. and the ground rises up to meet you as you fall. 
 Just imagine.

 ~Hungarian Camerawoman Caught Tripping Refugees Running From Police~ 
 ~Published on Sep 8, 2015~ 
 
 A Hungarian camerawoman was fired after kicking and tripping refugees running from the police. 
 She worked for the far-right Jobbik-affiliated channel N1TV. 
 This comes after another Hungarian news channel's leaked internal memo that requested refugee children be excluded from news packages.

 I'm originally from Puerto Rico. I was born in Santurce and raised in Rio Piedras. I currently live in Florida - since 1999. I have a doctorate degree in Medicine; completed in 1976. My Internal Medicine specialty was completed in 1979. Worked for Puerto Rico's health system until 1985. At this time, I'm happily retired after working for the federal government for almost 28yrs. I also worked for the government of Puerto Rico from 1979 through 1985 .... for a total of almost 40 years as a physician. I want to offer any knowledge that I have to anyone "out there" who is interested. My views are liberal in almost every sense. My knowledge is "eclectic" - a bit of everything. Music and reading are my passion. Blogging has also become a very interesting endeavor. Metaphysical topics attract me. I'm interested in news - reporting human issues like injustice, discrimination and abuse - the "wrongly" affected. My intention is to bring this knowledge to an understandable level and to help anyone in need. I'm open to questions and will answer them to the best of my ability. Currently working on an enterprise whose main mission will be to bring peoples of all walks of life together. To be one .... since we ALL are ONE!! The future looks bright and promising!!!
