 Want to kick-start your design career at an exciting and growing startup in Central Wimbledon? 
 Deskpro is a helpdesk platform that helps businesses to communicate better with their customers (both internal and external) across a variety of different channels (email, live chat, voice, etc.). 
 We are looking for a graphic design graduate who is a self-starter, inquisitive (always looking to improve design) and passionate about software and technology.   This role is hiring for an immediate start (January / February 2021). 
 You'll be part of our small but   awesome   design team, working in Central Wimbledon and feeding back directly to the Head of Design.   You will be using Figma and working closely with our Product & Design teams to improve our user-facing design across our website, software product and marketing materials. 
 You will have a voice and a chance to shape real designs to be used within Deskpro. This means that there is huge potential to make a really big impact and accelerate your career at a growing and profitable technology company. 
 You will be helping to re-design our website and improving the UI design of our software product. So it is a really exciting time to get involved at Deskpro, especially as you will be working with the the product team (that includes our CEO) and learning something new everyday!
