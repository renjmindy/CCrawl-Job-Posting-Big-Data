 Okay 
 Can You Believe It?! it's a Full-time job 
 If we were bragging we'd say, “Come join one of the fasting growing and best places to work with the hardest working and most talented team" but bragging isn't our thing, so we'll just say, “Hampton Water Rosé in New York, NY, USA is hiring a Marketing Manager." 
 About 
 Marketing at Hampton Water Rosé is all about building brand awareness in unique, out of the box ways. We are looking for a talented and versatile Marketing Manager to grow with our ever-evolving company. This person would be expected to develop and drive effective 360 marketing programs. He/She would need to be hungry and willing to create and execute new and exciting ways to tell our story. The ideal candidate is a self-starter, agile, and should possess both analytical, and creative skills with the ability to work independently, and cross-functionally within the organization. This person would need to be comfortable with day to day marketing, social media, influencer relations, PR gifting, email marketing, graphic design, and content creation. We expect this person to be up-to-date with the latest digital technologies and trends. This person should be a creative thinker, generate new ideas, have excellent communication skills, and be able to oversee a project from concept to completion. Are you a force of nature who thrives in a fast-paced environment? We need a self starter with an entrepreneurial spirit. If you want to be a part of the world’s favorite rosé brand, we would love to hear from you.
