 Depop is where the world's creatives come to buy, sell and discover the most inspiring and unique things. Depop was founded by co-founder of PIG magazine and RETROSUPERFUTURE sunglasses, Simon Beckerman. Originally a social network where PIG‚Äôs readers could buy items featured in the magazine. After realizing that Depop needed a selling function, Simon re-envisioned the app as a global marketplace ‚Äî a mobile space where you can see what your friends and the people you‚Äôre inspired by are liking, buying, and selling. In turn, your friends and creative influencers all over the world can see the things you like, buy, and sell, and are inspired by you. This ecosystem has supported Depop becoming a global conduit of connection, not only in m-commerce, but culture, design, and creative communities around the world.
