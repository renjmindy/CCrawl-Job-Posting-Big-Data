 Cranky Jobcentre Psych Tests Are Unethical, But Will Anyone Except Claimants Care? 
 Posted on  September 21, 2014  by  johnny void  |  117 Comments 
 The news that unmployed people will face psychological testing in order to determine how much Jocentre harassment they should receive has prompted warnings from psychologists concerned about the ethics of the scheme. 
 Esther McVey  recently announced  that Jobcentre busy-bodies will soon be expected to quiz new claimants to assess their  " attitudes, behavioural norms and levels of self-belief" . A small pilot scheme is currently taking place which is soon to be extended to 27,000 unemployed people. Those who fail this cranky assessment and are judged 'disengaged' or 'despondant' will no doubt face being 'helped' with forced unpaid work and benefit sanctions. 
 According to the British Psychological Society (BPS) :  “It is critical … that all assessments are conducted by experienced users of psychometrics - ideally under the supervision of a chartered psychologist. The success of a psychometric assessment of jobseekers will depend on sensitive, constructive and meaningful feedback about the results.” 
 Of course these tests will feature nothing of the sort. A  PCS Union briefing for Jobcentre staff  says that management have told them these assessments will take just  “2 to 5 minutes to complete” . There is no mention of any specialist training being provided to claimant advisors and certainly no sign of a chartered psychologist running the show. 
 What this means is that Jobcentre workers, already under pressure due to short-staffing, will now be expected to administer tests which psychologists regard as unethical. 
 Whether the BPS or PCS plan to actually do anything about this situation remains to be seen. Don't hold your breath, but you can ask them  @BPSOfficial  and  @PCS_Union .

 Didn't ATOS use healthcare "professionals" to get the terminally ill/profoundly disabled et al "fit" for work. 
My point is: The government couldn't give a toss as long as its denying benefits, no matter how much it costs to do it!

i totally agree with you on that….but need to add..the BPS should hang their heads in shame if they made such a statement.. 
the ideology behind nudge is vile, it's idea is to promote nation wide compliance to masters..it is highly destructive…i detest behaviourism and so should the BPS!

 obd, psychology has fallen into the eternal pit of ordure called behaviourism. Once in that pit. There is no way out for them, because behaviourism is so easy to make money out of (see Simon Wessely) and making money and getting kudos for bullshit is addictive. It leads them to neglect important things, like intelligence and being humane. The BPS and all the Royal Colleges are really just trade bodies these days. Ethics, morals, all down the pan for a few quid.

 "you gotta get your mind right Luke" 
 Last week, the Guardian revealed that a single mother of two said 
she was threatened with having her benefits removed if she didn’t 
complete the “my strengths” character survey. It asked users to 
give graded answers to questions such as “I never go out of my way 
to visit museums” and “I have not created anything of beauty in the 
last year”.

 Social Services, have been using these test for many years. They do use an independent professional service to conduct them. I don't think it would be appropriate for any unqualified person, to undertake such a sensitive task. 
 I also believe that it is NOT the responsibility of Jobcentre plus, to access any persons character or menal state in any way whatsoever.

 Furthermore, psychometric testing has serious doubts and criticisms hanging over its head for decades now, with its efficacy/adequacy already seriously questioned back in the 1990s… There's nothing like being up to date, I guess.

 This will have about as much validity and meaning as one of those 'what Rocky Horror Show character are you' quizzes on Facebook. It's just another way to grind people down and make rooting in bins seem more appealing than claiming benefits. 
It should be fairly straightforward for claimants to guess the correct answer. Which presumably will allow the DWP to then report how happy and positive claimants are. 
On the other hand, claimants could perhaps use the opportunity to launch into protracted expositions regarding how their answers are on he one hand yes on the other hand no and do the assessor's heads in. 
 And what if a claimants answers indicate they may be dangerously depressed? Oh I forgot - they don't give a shit.

 That sounds about right for the DWP. Another piece of junk scientific gobblydook about to be forced on people against their will by the government. 
 I'm surprised some kind of professional body has actually objected to the unethical pseudo-science adopted and used by the government on the poorest and most vulnerable people in society. 
 We've learnt by now not to hold our collective breath waiting for British professional governing and regulatory bodies such as the GMC, CQC and the Nursing and Midwifery Council to come and protect patients trapped inside the nightmare ESA regime from dangerous doctors and nurses and dangerous unethical pseudo-science. 
 Normally the self-styled "Sceptics" in the science and medical pages and threads of the lefty-liberal, latte-slurping, Unum-sponsored Guardian would be expected to criticise and exposed such "bad science". They're usually too obsessed about the science, or otherwise, behind relatively benign stuff such as homoeopathy or herbal remedies, which kill nobody, to ever criticise the screaming iatrogenic pseudo-science behind government policy. A case in point being the DWP ESA regime, which is killing thousands of patients with the willing participation of the British medical profession with no end in sight, but whose "biopsychosocial" junk science has yet to make into a single science or medical article in the pages of the Guardian as far as I'm aware.

 I would think that this would be against all kinds of privacy and health laws under the sun. 
 Next the DWP will be wanting to interfere with the health treatment you get from the doctor and stuff like that. 
 They'll be changing anti depressants and trying folks on all kinds of different drugs. Then, if you don't cave in and take a workfare place, or toilet cleaners job or the like, it'll be shock treatment they'll try and things like that . 
 I'm telling you i wouldn't put it past them. Like Jack Nicholson in "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" if you won't comply they'll try the electrodes as a last resort to fry your brain.

 Raining, sadly we are already headed down that road. One of the myriad, shitty help to work schemes is already piloting, where advisors from JC+ and WPP are nosing into our personal medical issues to identify anything as a "barrier to work" and an excuse to sanction. 
 None of these disgusting parasites are actually authorised or qualified to enquire about our personal medical details.

 Instead of wasting money on this why don't they use it to buy cheap houses in need of repair and give the unemployed REAL jobs to do. They are always saying they don't have any money but they have no trouble in finding money to throw down the drain. And by the way it is the govt's fault there aren't jobs. Stop wasting taxpayers money on propaganda exercises to draw attention away from that fact.

 Its quite amusing to think the gov. are stupid enough to waste money on this futile crap. If you were to ask a happy genuine job seeker and a 'despondent malingering no hoper' a set of questions to find out which was which you would get 2 sets of identical answers. They cannot hook people up to lie detectors.

 Actually it was the Labour party under Gordon Brown that brought in voice actuated lie detectors to filter people making claims for benefits. They were eventually dropped because they were flagging a majority of people making phone calls, including old age pensioners, as benefit fraudsters. Hard to believe but true.

 And that's about as effective as psychometric testing is - about the only organisation that uses them is the Scientologists, which should tell you all you need to know about psychometric testing. 
 In most of the serious psychological world these tests have been seen as at best dubious for the past 25 years or so - even the longer tests that take an hour plus to complete can be relatively easily falsified, so a test that lasts 2 to five minutes will literally be, as someone commented, about as valid as a Facebook test. 
 Psychometric belongs in the same category as snake oil.

 It would make no difference if it were. 
The whole point if any exercise they embark on is to instill fear and dread of the system. Once you realise this you can look them in the eye, laugh at them and collect what you are due. Yes, due. They take it out of your wage packet fast enough,and every other way they can think of. 
Like any other crooked business they just try to renege on the deal.

 Anybody who believes that anybody's psychological state can be tested by a layperson using a 5 minute test must be crazy. This is true lunacy. Even gypsies reading your palm put more of an effort into guessing what sort of a person you are than that. What complete and utter shit! Unadulterated shit!

Psycho-function in the UK: 
Coming via awesome Lynne Friedli and Boycott Workfare. The statement from the British Psychologists Society (currently trying to become a chartered Royal Society) is hardly a surprise. Since its inception clinical psychology has wanted to displace and occupy the Oeidipal position of psychiatry as the Master discourse of human subjectivity. If it has to embed itself as a coercive arm of the state then it will be more than happy to do so. Meanwhile, for those outside the UK, the references to the PCS Union hangs on the fact that their membership are the people who have been administering welfare sanctions.

 Scary Echoes 
 http://www.historytoday.com/lisa-pine/hashude-experiment-nazi-asocial-policy  Asocials were portrayed as the dregs of society, whose inferiority was marked by traits such as 'weak- ness of character', 'lack of restraint', 'loose morals', 'disinterest in contemporary events' ,'idleness' and 'poverty of' mind'. The term was applied in an elastic manner also, to include gypsies, vagabonds, persons of no fixed abode, prostitutes, alcoholics, unmarried mothers, homosexuals, large, 'inferior' families, criminals, 'idlers', 'good for nothings', 'wastrels', 'grumblers' and 'grousers', as well as any one else who did not, could not o would not perform their duties to the national community.

in the years 1942/43 almost 6.000 out of 12.658 "asocial prisoners" died in concentration camps under the programme "extermination through work programme". Pursuant to the 1871 Penal Code, the German labor houses were designed to serve as a "correctional post-confinement" following a sentence on the grounds of beggary, vagabondage, "work shyness", laziness, homelessness or prostitution. The Nazis considerably increased this type of penalty. Pursuant to the "measures for security and improvement", effective from 1934 Within the scope of the "operation against work-shyness" of the year 1938, 11,000 so-called "work-shy" individuals were arrested by the Third Reich authorities and transferred to concentration camps for labor purposes.

 The DWP are venturing into the territory of psychoanalysis, either that or Nazi Eugenics/CIA Mind Control, with this 'Attitude' bullshit. If they subject me to such a test I'm sure that it will take them far longer than 5 minutes to even understand the answers I'll provide, if they want to know what I really think. They won't know wtf I'm talking about, I betchya. If they start on the purpose/stroke benefits of work and I start on the Chemical Wedding and the origins of Modernity it should be fun….not.

 Sorry to hear that, Eric. It is enough to make anybody breakdown let alone those who already have anxiety and depression. Even years ago I was driven to near breakdown by Job Centre pressures. Now it is cruelty in the extreme. I know I would have a complete meltdown in there now if they started harassing me. I get much more agitated and angry than I used to.

 That's why the WRAG is ridiculous, Eric. People in WRAG supposed to have been found not fit for work and then you get the same screws tightened as you do on JSA which is bad enough. Hope your Clinical Psychologist agrees how awful these pseudo tests at the Job Centre are. Clinical Psychs need several years training so I should think they would be equally horrified that their training is being undermined by these fakes. But what do the government care? Doctors have years training but they chose to listen to Atos HCPs instead. Best wishes to you.

 I am also currenntly on ESA due to my experience of exiting Work Programme. I had a part time morning cleaning job at the time and my new JCP adviser, wanted to change my Jobseekers Agreement so that I spent 35 hours a week job seeking and tried to get my employer to increase my hours. 
 I refused to sign it. The following week, I was disallowed my JSA for failing to Actively Seek Employment. I appealed and lost the appeal because she lied on the forms but I could prove it. 
 Lying and misapplication of the law is normal practice for JPC staff, it's been going on for years. It's become part of their policy. Challenging this is extremely hard, even when you can prove you're right they will not give in. 
 Then they act all surprised and innocent, when someone reacts badly to the situation they caused. 
 This test is just another opportunity for JCP staff to take advantage.

 Before doing any test ask, "What are the medical qualifications of the person doing the test?" And "Will they provide proof of their qualifications if asked?" If there is a negative anser to either question the DWP/JCP should be told to FOXTROT OSCAR.

 It doesn't matter whether the tests are inflicted by 'trained professionals' or not -- even engaging with that question is giving the tests an undeserved moral validity. The test constitutes an accusation: 'You are lazy; prove that you're not'. It's insulting and humiliating, and is designed to be. It labels unemployed people naughty children. It maintains the fiction (the widespread acceptance of which is astonishing) that unemployed people themselves are the cause of lack of jobs. It also reinforces the power of those superior people, the 'professionals', to control the lives of the working class and the poor. 
 Resist these fucking tests; say No to them -- at this point, what do you have to lose? The government has made clear that, with the enthusiastic endorsement of the 55%, it's going to make life hell for you whatever you do. 
 And no, I don't think most 'respectable' people will care. The absence of the treatment of claimants in most left-wing discourse, including during the referendum (the RIC being an honourable exception), is a disgrace, and one that will come back to bite the people concerned -- because the treatment of the unemployed and unwaged is the foundation of economic domination of everyone, including those with jobs. (Duh … but why isn't it obvious to everyone?)

Most people who don't have to visit a jobcentre wouldn't care what they force the unemployed to do. 
That yes vote last week showed how many are happy with their lives. Regardless of the promises made to the Scots most of those who voted yes would have anyway. They could force us all to take the tests and find any reason to suspend payment of benefits even if it was illegal to do so. They would enjoy the fact that we would have to suffer for weeks before winning any appeal. The system is wrong when a person can suspend the payment of benefits with immediate effect without giving you a chance to give your side of the situation. Milliband saying yesterday that he wants to make the minimum wage £8 an hour by 2020 simply means an average of 25p a year increase until 2020. He puts forward things as if they really will make a difference but the better off will be getting a lot more than 25p a year increases and the difference between rich and poor will get even wider.

 WOULD THIS BE THE SAME MARTIN SELIGMAN MENTIONED BELOW? 
 DWP psych ‘test’ devised by US ‘torture guru’ 
21/04/2013 · by skwalker1964 · Bookmark the permalink. · 
 I wrote last week about a bogus online personality ‘test’ of 48 questions that Jobcentre Plus is forcing claimants to complete on behalf of the DWP – bogus because whatever answers you select, or even if you select none at all and just click next, you get the same or very similar answers. 
 From further investigation, it became apparent that this ‘test’ – forced on claimants as a ‘Jobseeker Direction’ that can result in ‘sanction’ of benefits if not obeyed – is being used as a tool to manipulate and intimidate terrified benefit-claimants, with the result that many could lose benefits simply for not being computer-literate, or even literate at all. That this is being done in a context of claimants committing suicide because of the fear of losing their benefits is utterly immoral. 
 That series of posts has been one of the most commented-on that I’ve written – and the more information that comes out, the bleaker and more damning the picture gets. That the ‘test’ and the issues around it show a callous disregard for human welfare and even human life on the part of Iain Duncan Smith’s Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) and the Tory front bench is hardly contestible. But there is an even more damning revelation. 
 The ‘test’ that the DWP ‘borrowed’, and is forcing unemployed people to take on pain of losing their benefits, was devised by a US psychologist alleged to have devised psychological-torture interrogation programmes for the US military and the CIA. 
 The questions the DWP has ‘borrowed’ come from the ‘Values in Action Inventory of Strengths’ test devised by Christopher Peterson and Martin ‘Marty’ Seligman. In 2001, Marty Seligman allegedly convened a ‘counter-terrorism and psychology’ meeting at his home, attended by, among others, the alleged creator of the CIA torture program, Dr. James Mitchell, and CIA Director of Behavioral Sciences Research, Kirk M. Hubbard. 
 enhancedinterrogation 
 Following this meeting, the CIA hired Dr Mitchell’s firm, Jessen and Associates, to devise an interrogation programme. In the same year, 2002, Kirk Hubbard invited Prof. Seligman to give a 3-hour lecture to the Navy SERE school in San Diego on his ‘learned helplessness’ concepts – a lecture attended by Mitchell, Jessen and Hubbard, and co-sponsored by the CIA. 
 Later the same year, the APA (American Psychological Association) amended its ethics rules to allow psychologists to ‘override’ their ethics when following orders from the CIA and the military, and the ‘enhanced interrogation’ programme – including the now-infamous ‘waterboarding’ technique and locking detainees in a ‘dog box’ – was launched. 
 A series of meetings, seminars and ‘workshops’ spun off from this, and an ethics ‘task force’ was launched by the APA to oversee the process – with 6 of its 10 members being psychologists employed by the CIA and military. 
 The results of the programme have been publicised, with journalists and even the occasional supportive politician undergoing waterboarding to see whether it’s as bad as has been claimed. As far as I know, no one has been able to bear it for very long. 
 In 2010, anti-corruption procurement processes were bypassed to aware a $31m, ‘no-bid’, sole-source contract to the University of Pennsylvania’s ‘Positive Psychology Center’ for training US soldiers in resistance to interrogation. The unit is directed by Prof. Seligman. 
 These may sound like ‘conspiracy theory’ ravings, but they are documented facts. You can read about them in a document published by the Coalition for an Ethical Psychology here. 
 That the DWP is threatening people with the removal of their benefits if they don’t take a test that provides meaningless answers is deeply worrying – and caused me to use the term ‘psychological torture’ to describe it. 
 But that the DWP and its contractors are using a test devised by a man who appears to be closely-associated with actual psychological torture by military and intelligence organisations makes the whole matter even more damning – and one that should be occupying the attention of Parliament and the media.

 Martin Seligman is not a stranger to controversy. 
 After graduating from the Princeton University in 1964 Seligman he decided to follow an academic career and went on to study for his PhD at the University of Pennsylvania. It was there as a PhD student there that he worked on using aversion to treat homosexuality. However Seligman later noted that this work was seriously flawed. 
 Sadly, for the DWP, this came too late….. 
He disappeared over the hillside, fat cheque in hand..

LINGUISTIC PROGRAMMING, to be used on uk citizens? 
 3/ How would it make people make "better choices"? 
 4/ Who was the author of the "My Strengths" character survey that 
was used on claimants? 
 5/ What relevance were the questions in the survey, other than mind 
programming? 
 6/ Who was the civil servant from the "Nudge Team" who approached 
VIA to use a slimmed down version? 
 7/ Why was a non validated version used if the test showed it to be 
a failure? 
 8/ Show evidence to support that the test was "scientifically shown 
to show peoples strengths"?

British Psychological Society and Health and Care Professions 
Council? 
 10/ Has there been any feedback from these organisations? 
 11/ Who are the qualified psychologists that work for the NUDGE 
UNIT, who signed off the project? 
 12/ Why were people being deceived and coerced into something that 
they had no knowledge of? 
 13/ How much money has the DWP paid to the NUDGE UNIT? 
 14/ Could the £520.000 per annum cabinet office be seen as a 
complete waste of time and money given that it is up for sale? 
 We can confirm that this response has been drafted in conjunction with the Behavioural 
Insights Team at the Cabinet Office who were responsible for the piloting of this tool. For any 
technical queries relating to this issue please contact:

Firstly, a number of the points which you raise are not asking for information held by the DWP 
but for opinions on issues raised in a newspaper article – questions 2, 3, 5, 8, 12,and 14. The 
Freedom of Information (FoI) Act allows for the providing of recorded information held by the 
DWP. It is not intended as an opportunity to debate issues or provide opinions. Therefore we 
cannot provide a response to these points. 
In response to the remainder of your request please see the following: 
Questions 1 and 6 – the pilot in Essex was a local Jobcentre Plus initiative in conjunction with 
the Cabinet Office. The Cabinet Office continues to have a good working relationship with the 
VIA institute and the Cabinet Office is continuing to work together with VIA to determine the 
best way to help claimants identify their strengths. 
 Question 4 - the ‘My Strengths’ exercise comes from the work of Professor Martin Seligman. 
See references below for details. 
 Question 7 – ‘My Strengths’ is based on a wide area of academic research. This research 
shows that helping people self-identify their strengths can be a useful part of a portfolio of tools 
that help improve wellbeing. The ‘My Strengths’ exercise was adapted from wide academic 
literature to make it easier for UK claimants to use. 
 Questions 9 and 10 - DWP has not received any complaints or comments from the British 
Psychological Society or the Health and Care Professions Council. 
 Question 11 - the decisions of the Cabinet Office Behavioural Insights Team are made by 
members of the team in coordination with their managers. The team has a number of 
psychologists and economists. 
 Claimants were offered the ‘My Strengths’ exercise with a full explanation of its purpose. 
 Question 13 - the ‘My Strengths’ incurred zero cost to government. 
Papers used in the development of ‘My Strengths’ include:

 Dear Department for Work and Pensions, 
Recently the following story appeared in the Guardian newspaper; 
 Jobseekers' psychometric test 'is a failure' 
 US institute that devised questionnaire tells 'nudge' unit to stop 
using it as it failed to be scientifically validated 
 A Job Centre in Glasgow

 An American psychology organisation has told a UK government agency 
to stop using a personality test on jobseekers because it is a 
failure. 
 The Behavioural Insight team, or "nudge" unit, which was created by 
David Cameron in 2010 to help people "make better choices", has 
been accused by the Ohio-based VIA Institute on Character of bad 
practice after civil servants used VIA's personality tests in pilot 
experiments in Essex despite being refused permission to do so.

 The £520,000-a-year Cabinet Office unit run by Dr David Halpern was 
told by VIA – whose members devised the personality test – to stop 
using the questionnaire because it had failed its scientific 
validation. 
 Last week, the Guardian revealed that a single mother of two said 
she was threatened with having her benefits removed if she didn't 
complete the "my strengths" character survey. It asked users to 
give graded answers to questions such as "I never go out of my way 
to visit museums" and "I have not created anything of beauty in the 
last year". 
 Official letters sent to jobseekers by the Department for Work and 
Pensions (DWP) stated that the test was "scientifically shown to 
find people's strengths". 
 Kelly Aluise, VIA's communications director, said the institute had 
previously been approached by a civil servant from the nudge team 
to use a slimmed-down version of its 120- and 240-question 
"character strengths" survey. 
 However, she said, the civil servant was refused permission by 
VIA's education director, Dr Ryan Niemiec. 
 "They were not allowed to use it," she said. 
 In correspondence seen by the Guardian, Niemiec said the test was a 
failure. "They are using the non-validated version … we had tested 
it a while back and it failed," Niemiec wrote. 
 In November 2011, the civil servant set up a 48-question version of 
the test for the Cabinet Office on the website to which jobseekers 
have been referred to complete the test, which has now been rolled 
out to other areas of the country. 
 The Guardian has been informed that complaints against the unit's 
use of the bogus survey have been lodged with the British 
Psychological Society and the Health and Care Professions Council, 
which regulate the practice of registered psychologists. 
 The DWP confirmed that qualified psychologists – understood to be 
from the nudge unit – had signed off the project, which was meant 
to boost confidence and help the unemployed back into work. 
 Aluise said VIA had asked the Behavioural Insight team to take down 
its survey and refer jobseekers to their own online version of the 
questionnaire. 
 Within hours of the Guardian contacting the Cabinet Office about 
the issue, the not-for-profit VIA institute, which says it is 
"dedicated to advancing … evidence-based practices of character 
strengths", declined to make further comment and said it had 
resolved its differences with the Behaviourial Insights team. 
 "Any misunderstandings that may have occurred between VIA and the 
Behavioural Insights team have been resolved at this point," it 
said. 
 The Cabinet Office said the nudge unit – which is being put up for 
sale – "has a good relationship with VIA, and they are in regular 
communication". 
 In response to questions about whether the test was validated, the 
Cabinet Office backed away from previous written assurances to 
jobseekers and said the survey was only "based on a scientifically 
validated questionnaire". 
 Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday, Gerry Stoker, 
professor of politics and governance at the University of 
Southampton, raised questions about the unit's ethical approval 
practice. 
 "What kind of process of ethical intervention have any of these 
interventions gone through?" he asked. 
 "When you're deceiving people or potentially … coercing people to 
be part of something that they don't know they are part of, I think 
that does raise significant issues."

 I stopped reading a mental health self-help book when the authors described Martin Seligman as a 'distinguished psychologist'. 
 He is notorious for his 1965 experiments which reduced dogs to a state of 'learned helplessness' -- that is, despair. So it's not surprising that he went on to contribute to the development of CIA interrogation methods. 
 If a working-class youth followed the classic pattern of early cruelty to animals, leading to later cruelty to humans, he would be classed as a psychopath. When a rich academic does the same thing, he's called a distinguished psychologist.

 ok guys my stance on this issue as with many that involves the gestapo is non compliance as much as possible without sanctions. 
 So my idea is this and please comment and rip this apart if possible. Sort of proof testing if you like. 
So to my idea, well what if we feck the system up by being compliant but by answering the questions with a no comment without saying no comment. 
So for example I could answer a question with 
"well yes Lucy I would love to answer your question and once my health issue is no longer an issue I would be pleased to discuss this with you in detail" 
Or words to that effect. Please click the link and read for more and better information.

 There was a good report online which highlighted that it was the unionists who set out to gloat over the success of the no vote who were the main attackers. 
 (PS I was on another forum where the argument was that the so-called nazi salutes were actually "red hand of ulster" salutes - so that's ok then!)

Most people who don’t have to visit a jobcentre wouldn’t care what they force the unemployed to do. 
That yes vote last week showed how many are happy with their lives. Regardless of the promises made to the Scots most of those who voted yes would have anyway. They could force us all to take the tests and find any reason to suspend payment of benefits even if it was illegal to do so. They would enjoy the fact that we would have to suffer for weeks before winning any appeal. The system is wrong when a person can suspend the payment of benefits with immediate effect without giving you a chance to give your side of the situation. Milliband saying yesterday that he wants to make the minimum wage £8 an hour by 2020 simply means an average of 25p a year increase until 2020. He puts forward things as if they really will make a difference but the better off will be getting a lot more than 25p a year increases and the difference between rich and poor will get even wider.

 If they are using a quick 2-5 minutes test - the like of which can be found in a womens magazine (do this quick test to see if you are depressed) Then they will probably be able to skate around any sort of medical negligence type claim. 
 But all is not lost - There are probably health and safety issues, and there might also be fun and games to be had with local council and "safeguarding adults" policies & duties. I actually think this is quite promising as the DWP can simply twist itself into pretzels over its own policies - but HSE and Safeguarding both belong elsewhere.

 DWP are already using their position of power to alter medical treatments.I was found 'Fit for Work' back in March and when I went to my GP to get another Fit Note my GP declined to give me one and said that if the DWP thought I was fit for work then I jolly well should get back to work. 
 So now I am trying to live precariously on what ever I can 'earn' or beg or borrow but am determined not to sign on again for JSA or ESA.

 Perhaps he is not fit for work, how the fuck would the DWP know? they're not Doctors. Signing-on can be too stressful for some people and I can fully understand why someone would want to avoid it. I'm unfit for work too, but the Doctors also won't give me a sick note either. I just claim JSA instead, and take medication to help me to be able to sign-on.
