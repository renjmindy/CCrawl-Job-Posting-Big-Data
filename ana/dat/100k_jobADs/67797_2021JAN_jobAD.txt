 Handling changes in your job situation

 I was working in a good department in my office, where I was very happy. Due to office politics, there was a reshuffle. I was put in a different section where work is really hectic and worse under a boss who is very un-accommodating. 
 Can you please advise us as to what I can do or chant to enable me to move back to my former department?

 Chant, “WALNUT CHANGE DIVINE ORDER” 
 Explanation 
 Walnut: a Bach flower remedy that helps us to manage all types of transitions. Please refer the blog:  http://healbybachflowers.wordpress.com/2009/03/27/the-21st-century-magic-pill-%e2%80%93-walnut-the-bach-flower-remedy/ 
 Change: a switch word to manage a situation from un-acceptable to acceptable situation 
 Divine Order: a situation, willed by the divine

 Dear Sir, 
 we both love each other, however our parents will not agree due to difference in caste. We both dont want to go against our parents and so we meet as friends with love in our hearts. We both agree that when we know our relationship will not work then why to continue. But both of us miss each other. Is there any switch word that will help us take the right decision. Is HOLE a switch word to find our right person? How many times should we chant?

1. Take the flower remedies Chicory walnut and Coral(gem stone). Take them orally for three months. Then you can forget the love and be comfortable. 
2. Chant "Change Divine order Find Divine Love" 
Change the love pain and regain the Divine order is the meaning 
3. There is one programme to find a right person. You have to write one statement one day. There will be ten statements, which you comeplete in ten days. Repeat the cycle for four times. You will find the right partner.The statements are prepared by Naran. 
4. You can also listen to cd "I LOVE MYSELF" and "Soul Love" daily.

 Sir, I am i such a bad situation and all i can do is trusting in the words you gave me. How many times should i chant RELEASE RESISTANCE FIND COUNT DIVINE NOW. The mony I need is huge, should i think of the sum and chant the switchwords? or should i just chant them and don´t think of anything? Any advice in chanting will help me a lot.

 dont think of anything. chant as many number of times as possible. write the switch words in a paper and keep it under the pillow. Carrry the paper with you when you are awake and see the words many times.
