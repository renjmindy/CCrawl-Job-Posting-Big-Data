 Top 5 Signs You Need to Switch Jobs 
 Danna Borbon 
 One of the hardest career decisions a person needs to make (next to choosing a career) is if they need to switch jobs. If like many professionals, you’ve been meticulous in choosing the organization you’re joining, then switching jobs doesn’t come easy. However, there are surefire signs that just says you need to start looking for a new job at  JobStream App  and start fresh with a new company. Here are some of them: 
 You Feel Complacent 
 Working the same job for years is great—only if you still feel driven. Have you stopped thinking about getting a promotion or working on other projects? A stagnant career may cause an employee to feel “too comfortable,” and forget about growing professionally. It’s important to keep yourself competitive and think about your next move when things are going too well. This doesn’t mean you need to leave your current job ASAP, but perhaps consider taking on other projects that will keep you on your toes. 
 There’s No Career Advancement 
 Company culture plays a crucial role in any organization. For instance, if your current employer doesn’t promote growth from within and would rather hire someone new for a superior role, it may be time to get yourself packing. You would want to give your time and effort to an employer who sees and values your worth. 
 You Have to Drag Yourself to Work 
 If you see your current job as just a means to make money, then it might be time to reconsider your options. A great career should make you feel good about yourself and inspire others as well. Work will always be a part of your life and holding a job that doesn’t give you any sense of pride and accomplishment won’t help you grow. Just keep in mind that you need to make a solid plan before leaving your current job. 
 Better Opportunity 
 Like they say, an opportunity knocks once in a lifetime. There are good offers, then there are irresistible offers. Receiving an irresistible offer is a good reason to quit your current 9-5, since a better offer means your employer isn’t meeting your expectations as an employee. Of course, you also need to consider other factors such as the work environment, distance, and the like. 
 Schedule 
 Working long hours or working the night shift can have a serious effect on your health and lifestyle. Lack of sleep, for instance, can result to more than just a grumpy mood. Losing sleep regularly can lead to life-threatening illnesses such as heart disease, obesity, and diabetes. It’s crucial for an individual to get the required hours of sleep in a day, so if you’re not used to working the night shift or extended hours, your work schedule is reason enough to switch jobs. 
 It may sound cliché, but  work-life balance  is essential. The company you work for should promote this and let employees live a healthy lifestyle in and out of the workplace.
