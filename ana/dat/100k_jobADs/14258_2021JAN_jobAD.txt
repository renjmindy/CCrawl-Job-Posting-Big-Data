You will have a training qualification and be confident in delivering in-house Health & Safety Training to target audiences across the group. 
You will be a proactive person who has a strong sense of work ethic and a desire to develop. You will be confident and a people person, keen to make a difference. You will be an excellent communicator and be good at using IT systems. You will be project orientated and able to excel in a remote working independent role.
