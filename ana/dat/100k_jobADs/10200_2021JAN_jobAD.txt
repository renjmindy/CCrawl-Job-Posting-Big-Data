 Workiva One of Fortune Magazine’s 100 Best Companies to Work For 
 March 5, 2020 
 Marty Vanderploeg 
 Workiva is honored to be recognized for the second time by FORTUNE® magazine as one of the  100 Best Companies to Work For® . We are grateful to be listed alongside some of the most successful and forward-thinking companies—many of whom are our customers—in this prestigious group. 
 Our mission at Workiva—to build trust in the global economy—is supported by our company values: customer success, innovation, trust, integrity, inclusion, collaboration, and accountability. To understand why Workiva is such a special place, simply take a closer look at what our values mean to us. 
 Customer success  : We are successful because we put our employees first, listen to their voices, and respond to their needs. This extra level of care gets passed on to our customers every day, which leads to some of the highest customer satisfaction scores in any industry. 
 Innovation  : **** Keeping our customers on the cutting edge of  technology  requires talented and dedicated employees, who are given the resources and freedom they need—backed by a culture of collaboration and diverse thought—to keep breaking new ground. 
 Trust  : Our Workiva platform helps our customers all over the world sleep better at night, knowing that their data is connected in one place and their business decisions are based on reports that are secure, transparent, and accurate. We provide thousands of companies and government agencies with the tools they need to collaborate and connect their data in a secure, cloud-based environment. We also rely on each other. Employees can use paid time-off to help each other in times of need or volunteer in their communities. 
 Integrity  : We communicate honestly and openly with our employees and our customers. This year we will eliminate single-use plastics in all our offices because it’s the right thing to do. We only have one home, and we want to take care of it. 
 Inclusion  : We foster a work environment that values all backgrounds, beliefs, and interests, and we recognize this diversity as an important part of our innovation and success.  Our culture  is so strong that it has its own tagline: “My Voice. My Company.” It reflects how our employees are empowered to speak openly through frequent town halls, live Q&As with executives, employee surveys, and digital-chat channels. 
 Collaboration  : We encourage people to truly support each other at work, through peer recognition, employee resource groups, and culture events. We are constantly connecting with each other through internal communication channels. 
 Accountability  : Workiva is a digital workplace with flexible work hours because sometimes real life happens between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Our cloud-based platform makes it possible for our employees to seamlessly work with team members, regardless of location. Our commitment to communication—through one-on-one meetings, video conferences, and digital chatrooms—keeps Workiva teams connected and focused on achieving business goals and objectives. 
 We made  FORTUNE’s 100 Best Companies to Work For list  because our values guide us in everything we do. They shape how we treat one another, how we serve our customers, and how we support the communities where we live and work. 
 Our mission gives us purpose, our company values guide everything we do, and our culture connects us in a workplace where we all belong.
