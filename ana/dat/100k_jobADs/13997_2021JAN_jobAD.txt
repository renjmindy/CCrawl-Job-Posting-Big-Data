 Company Description 
 Founded in 2019 by two proven entrepreneurs, Glorify is on a mission to bring the joy of connecting and reconnecting with God on a daily basis to Christians all around the world. Our vision is to become the leading Christian digital platform globally, reinventing how Christians connect with God and their community. Think Calm or Headspace but for the global Christian market. 
 The Glorify mobile app utilises bite-size readings, meditations, music and gamifications techniques to enable Christians to spend daily time with God through guided worship routines, curated content and a world-class user experience. 
 Backed by some of the leading Christian influencers globally, Glorify is targeting massive expansion and scale over the next 12 months. We have recently closed a large funding round and are now ready to expand the team in London, and internationally.
