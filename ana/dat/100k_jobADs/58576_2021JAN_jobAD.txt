 Zalando is Europe‚Äôs leading online platform for fashion, connecting customers, brands and partners across 17 markets. We drive digital solutions for fashion, logistics, advertising and research, bringing head-to-toe fashion to more than 23 million active customers through diverse skill-sets, interests and languages our teams choose to use. üåç. IT ALL STARTED WITH A SHOE... üë†...in a shared apartment/office/warehouse on Berlin‚Äôs trendy Torstrasse. Well, a few pairs of shoes actually. Since then we‚Äôve sold a lot more shoes and have grown to be Europe‚Äôs largest online fashion retailer or you may call us Europe's most fashionable tech department. Today, we offer fashion-lovers in 15 different countries our wide range of products ‚Äì from High Street favourites to designer brands, sportswear and kidswear for him and her. A lot has changed since then, but our core values have always remained the same ‚Äì combining great fashion with the latest technology and exceptional customer service. A PROUD COMMUNITY Over the years, we have built a strong community. We love to share our passions, insights and expertise for technologies and topics we love through 100+ self-organised guilds, internal tech talks, training initiatives, demos, local meet-up events, conferences and more. In addition to encouraging an engaged community, we support you in building your reputation as tech leader - not only among your peers at Zalando but industry-wide. We know that every new technology and methodology we implement involves a learning curve, so our teams are dedicated to help everyone get up to speed on using the tools they need to work successfully. OPEN SOURCE üì¢ We're passionate about collaboration and giving back to the community. Check out our open source projects to learn more about the technologies we are contributing to and building.
