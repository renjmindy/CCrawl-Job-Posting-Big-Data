 Snow Job 
 A blizzard blanketed New Jersey, but no worries, kids. Governor Chris Christie knows how to deal with Snow! 
 Original image 
 From  POLITICAL HOTSHEET  at  CBS NEWS  : 
 
 While Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was vacationing in Disney World this week, he was taking a few shots back home from some of his Democratic opponents as  the state dug out from a blizzard  that dumped more than two feet of snow in some places. 
 Christie's office is now pushing back against complaints that both he and the also-Republican lieutenant governor [Kim Guadagno] should never have taken a vacation at the same time, especially during a snow emergency. 
 While Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was vacationing in Disney World this week, he was taking a few shots back home from some of his Democratic opponents as  the state dug out from a blizzard  that dumped more than two feet of snow in some places. 
 Christie's office is now pushing back against complaints that both he and the also-Republican lieutenant governor should never have taken a vacation at the same time, especially during a snow emergency. 
 â€¦snipâ€¦ 
 [â€¦] Democratic State Sen. Raymond Lesniak [questioned] "the purpose of the office" of lieutenant governor, which was created in 2005, largely in response to the fallout from when former Governor Jim McGreevey left office suddenly. 
 "We clearly made a mistakeâ€¦and wasted money if the lieutenant governor is not going to be here when the governor is out of state," said Lesniak, according to  NorthJersey.com . 
 â€¦snipâ€¦ 
 "Thirty-one inches of snow. Hundreds of serious incidents, roads closed down, states of emergency. This is not an insignificant incidentâ€¦ This is serious," Lesniak said, according to NorthJersey.com. "I think it points to a real revaluation of at least the way this office is being handled in the future." 
 For his part, the [Democratic] acting governor of New Jersey while Christie is away, [State Senate President Steve] Sweeney, said he doesn't want to get involved in the dispute. 
 â€¦snipâ€¦ 
 While this appears to be a domestic squabble, Christie has drawn the admiration and attention of Republicans nationally for his straight-talking, tough style, and his Christmas holiday in the Magic Kingdom has been fodder for political media across the country. 
 Hanging out with Mickey Mouse while backs all over New Jersey ache under the strain of shoveling two feet of snow will probably not help his poll numbers at home either. The Hill also reports that Christie's popularity in New Jersey slipped five points in a Quinnipiac poll released this month. 
 
 They could have avoided all this, if they had just told Christie that it was another kind of blizzardâ€¦

Why, I bet that, not only would he have stayed in New Joisey, but Princess Sarah Palin would have joined him to continue with her war on the war on childhood obesity!

 Nice to know that Republican leaders are still following the example of their role model who sat gawping at a kid's book about a pet goat while the World Trade Center was blowing up. 
 Notice the expression on the huge dwarf (???) at the far right. I don't think that's Grumpy; it looks more like Christie is standing on his foot. Or maybe he's just mad about being the only person in the picture even further to the far right than Christie is. 
 Palin knows how to deal with cold weather. She would shoot the snow (and miss). But Christie looks pretty blissed out in that DQ picture. Methinks that's something with a little more oomph than ice cream, if you get my drift.

 What is it with GOP politicians who just happen to be on vacation and keep vacationing (or spent too long vacationing) when natural and other disasters strike?

 i don't think cc likes new joisey very much. he seems to like to spend his time everywhere else. 
 i wonder along with the dems as to why there's a lieutenant governor's position, when the person in that position is unavailable when the governor is away.

 NJ residents should stock up lots of snowballs in their freezers & pelt both the SOB's w snow upon their return!

 Step away from the scissors, Nonnie. My son, my VAIN 21 year old son, makes me cut his McFro. It's a nightmare. He refuses to let anyone else touch the locks, and I only agree to do it when I can't stand looking at him anymore. (This would be the point where he has three times more hair than face. ðŸ˜¯ )

 my son didn't cut his hair for something like 16 years, maybe more. i always said he was a hippie born a couple of decades too late. he always wore it in a ponytail. i never told him to cut it, because i knew that would be a sure-fire way to make sure he never did. one day, about a year or so ago, he comes walking in, and his head was shaved. i gasped, because i honestly didn't recognize him for a minute. everyone was shocked. i look at that day as the day he finally grew up.

 In my part of New Jersey Christie has been very unpopular all along - let's hope this makes him unpopular in the parts of New Jersey that actually voted for him. Great post, Nonnie, love the graphics!

 you, apparently, live in one of the smarter sections of new joisey. i can't see what anyone saw in this buffoon in the first place. i wouldn't trust anyone who worked for chimpy.

 It won't be too hard to locate him at mouseworld, just check the vendors selling cake. I'm trying to get used to the weird winter weather of the Sierra where the altitude of the snowline is the critical factor. We got it two days in a row at 2,000 at arriving. It's funny listening to traffic reports from Sacramento. First one I heard says: "So far, Donner Pass is still open". Hmm. If I go that way, better remember to take sandwiches!

 i bet he leaves a trail like snails do. i'm still trying to get used to the weird winter weather here. the last few years have been bizarre. it's rare that we get temps in the 30s, and that happened twice in the last week. 
 if you go to the donner pass, don't just bring sandwiches, look as unappetizing as you possible can.

 I heard that all seven dwarves and Snow White filed a sexual harassment suit against him. I hope that idiot got eaten alive by bedbugs while he was there.

 i heard that he stole their lunch, too. i think he could feed every bedbug in the world. not sure if that would be good or bad. would they thrive, having access to so much food, or would they die from all the toxic sludge that flows through his veins?

 I like how he continues to defend his action and now blame his wife. Christie thinks his job is cutting and slaying and not worrying about Pr. Well let's see. I don't think he realizes how much of plutos doo doo he stepped in

 and he's blaming mayor, too, and the media. it's everyone's fault but his. i think he just kissed any presidential hopes goodbye.

 Yeah, Christie will probably pull a Barbour and free the seven dwarves and then all will be right again in the world. By the way, the dwarf to Christie's right looks a bit too happy AND you can't see Christie's right hand, either. Just sayin' 
 Always loved that tune!

 i think the dwarf to cc's right is in shock. that's a grimace, not a smile, because he just heard cc's stomach rumbling, and he's scared.
