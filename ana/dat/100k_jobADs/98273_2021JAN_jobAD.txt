 How much is a job post? 
 Written by  Joe Visconti 
Updated over a week ago 
 Job posts are  free with an active WNW subscription . 
 The number of jobs you can post at the same time depends on the type of plan you have. 
 With a Basic plan, you get 1 active job post at a time. A Pro plan includes up to 3 active job posts at a time. 
 You can swap out job posts as frequently as you want. All of your jobs are stored under "My Jobs". 
 Please note, closing a job post is not the same as cancelling your subscription.
