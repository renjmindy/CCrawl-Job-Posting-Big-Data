 Gams stochastic programming 
 Published: Last month  Bids: 0 
 I have optimization a couple of deterministic optimization models.  I have to made two mayor improvements. 
 1. To make the optimization under a set of scenarios where parameter take several realizations.  It is important the aim is to optimize the objective function under several criterion like VaR, CVar or EV. The goal is not to make the optimization for every single realization. 
I will pass  you the deterministic model and the deliverable is the gdx model with three optimization alternatives mentioned (VaR, CVar and EV). 
2.  I have a deterministic model where the objective function is the benefit of agent A plus the benefit of agent B. 
We want to make it more realistic using a multilevel model.  Eventually in one level we want to introduce stochastic parameters. 
 The idea is two make it at a closed price, so please prove a quote for every service. 
 I have done this before but I am really short of time and I need some help. 
Thanks
