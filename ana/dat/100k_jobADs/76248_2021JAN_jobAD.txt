 Another insulting job hoop to jump through 
 By  hjonasson  on October 3, 2018 
 When looking for jobs, I appreciate companies that can get to the point about what they want, ask for my résumé and a sample of my work and then an interview if they feel we match. 
 What I do NOT appreciate are companies that make you jump through unnecessary hoops that have nothing to do with the position. Most of the time, these companies have hired a recruiting service that gives out the same basic tests for all positions, whether you are applying to be a flight attendant or a gardener. How much money are these recruiting companies making off large corporations that have no idea of their methods? 
 Last year, after applying for a job as a writer, I was told I would have a job interview via video chat over the computer. I went over my résumé, dressed nicely and clicked the button to connect for my interview. Instead of an actual person, it was a recorded video with text that asked, "How would you make the perfect sandwich?" I simply said, "No, I'm not doing this," and shut down the link. If a company is asking for someone to write text for their billing program, as this one was, then ask me about that particular subject and my work. I don't have time for psychological mind games to test quirky personality traits. 
 Now I've applied for another writing job for an internet company. They were interested in my résumé and asked me to take an online test. The instructions were, "block off an hour of your time and be well-rested so you can concentrate on the test." I wrongly assumed it would be a writing test with different case studies. 
 Nope. 
 It was not a writing test at all, but what I'm guessing must be some sort of "are you a psychopath" test after going through it. I took screenshots of some of the questions. Please tell me what this has to do with applying for a copywriting job: 
 From these questions, I gather this job would be looking for a megalomaniac who's been through some weird experiences and some weird food and plans to take over the world. 
 But when I applied with another company for the "take over the world" job, I only had to send a résumé and a cover letter, so I find it odd that the IT company writing job requires answers to these questions.
