  Job Seekers: 5 Smart Steps On Twitter  
 Rosa Elizabeth Vargas 
 February 20, 2014 
 Every job seeker who is using Twitter for job search purposes pretty much just gets on board and hastily creates a Twitter account. However, a few calculated steps will be invaluable in the launching of your Twitter account for an effective job search campaign.  Related:   How To Maximize The Impact Of Your Story With Social Media  Please read the following and see if you can tweak your account today. 
 
 1. Choose Your Twitter Account Name 
 Keep it professional, career, or industry relevant. 
 2. Include A Picture! Don't Be Shy 
 Although you are job searching, this is also a social networking site. Besides, no matter what hang-ups you have about your looks - interviews are still face-to-face! 
 3. Don't Protect Your Tweets 
 How will others determine if you are tweeting interesting and vital information? Are you asking us to follow you before we even know what you are tweeting about? Besides, what are you hiding? 
 4. Be Selective With Your Tweet Topics 
 Remember that every tweet you compose becomes a Google page and will remain in cyberspace forever, so don't talk about things that will come back to ruin your reputation or employability. 
 5. Create A Personal Account 
 Keep your Twitter account for job searching professionally branded. If you want to connect with friends and discuss more personal topics, create a personal account and tweet whatever you want but use a nickname or pseudo name for that account. You want your professional account to be the one to show up in Google when someone searches your name! Right? Remember your online profile and social media accounts represent your digital image.
