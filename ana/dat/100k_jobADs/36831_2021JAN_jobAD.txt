 The "Idea Etherverse" (or How to Be More Creative at Work) 
 Posted on  February 3, 2019  by   Buddy_Scalera 
 
 Original post: 2/4/2012 
 Updated: 2/3/2019 
 Introduction to Updates: Since writing this in 2012, the world of digital and creativity has evolved quite a bit. At the time, I was working in the digital marketing division of a large agency called Ogilvy CommonHealth Worldwide. The agency is still operating, but I have moved on to work on the client side. The updates here will reflect that shift in my employment role. 
 Talking About "Creativity" 
 In my line of work, people talk a lot about creativity. I've worked as a content strategist and copywriter at a marketing agency and on the client side. No matter where you work, people look to creative teams for fresh ideas. After all, that's why we're called "creatives."  Continue reading ->

 Help Wanted: Search Specialist 
 Posted on  December 30, 2008  by   Buddy_Scalera 
 As we increasingly move to an Internet-centric society, we're seeing all kinds of new and interesting careers spring up. Soon, we'll see some interesting career opportunities for smart, adaptable workers. 
 A few years ago, we saw the rise of professional bloggers and search engine marketing specialists. Right now, we're seeing professionals developing mobile applications and social media widgets. 
 In 2009, we'll see the evolution of the Search Specialist. Now, these people are already out there in niche jobs (and they'll probably be able to find this blog posting). But coming soon, we'll probably see headhunters and HR departments looking for knowledge workers who can quickly and effectively mine the Net for super-specific information. 
 It would be natural to expect this to go to someone with a library sciences degree, but I think Search Specialists will evolve from people who work within specific industries. 
 I'll give you an example. I worked as an editor at a small e-marketing agency specializing in pharmaceutical communications directed at healthcare professionals. On my team, I had an editor who was a wizard at uncovering information on the web. 
 Sure, she was good at Google, but that's a given. She also knew how to dig deeper and get information in other search engines, like Yahoo, Ask, and MSN (all of which give different results). She also knew how to search blogs, message boards, and news articles to dig up more information. 
 This is going back a few years before the big YouTube and Twitter explosion. But a Search Specialist will be the kind of person who can quickly and effectively dig up, organize, and present highly focused data sources. 
 In our case, this editor could dig up information, sort the gems from the junk, and generate an informed position on just about any topic you can imagine. Going forward, and it's going to be important to access all kinds of information on the public Net, even the stuff that isn't well tagged and indexed by Google. 
 Blogs, videos, Flash interfaces, games, e-books, Twitters posts, social networks (including Facebook & MySpace), manuals, databases, closed communities, news archives, software, all contain valuable information. Some of this information is indexed, but most of it is not. 
 Several industries already leverage search specialists, including patent and other legal businesses. In the future, other industries will seek people out who can mine and measure information from Net sources. 
 Search Specialists will be needle-in-a-haystack researchers who defy traditional job roles. Some of them will be research specialists or editors or scientists or journalists or work from home entrepreneurs. 
 In the beginning, they will be underpaid and under appreciated. But one day they will be valued and coveted knowledge workers who can extract stubborn data from nearly any source. In the right organization, they will be highly paid and highly promotable, especially as they research corporate strategies. 
 If you like to search, discover, and organize, it's probably a good time to start positioning yourself as a Search Specialist in your current career. Eventually, as the career landscape shifts, you'll be prepared for a new career as a Search Specialist.
