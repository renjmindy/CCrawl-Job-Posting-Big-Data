 13 Times Zoos Were Bad for Animals 
 "Many people aren’t aware of the cruelty behind zoos, so it’s good that you’re thinking about animals used for entertainment. When I was a kid, I went to the zoo all the time with my family. I loved pandas as a kid (still do!), and I thought being able to see them in person would be neat. But once I saw them “up close and personal,” I realized that the animals were miserable. 
 It instantly became very clear to me that the animals imprisoned in zoos are sad and don’t want to be kept in artificial environments, have people gawk at them, listen to children who bang on the windows of their enclosures, or have cameras flashing in their faces. To put it simply, zoos are imprisoning animals who want to be free. 
 Captive animals are  deprived of everything that is natural and important to them , and as a result, they become bored and lonely and many even suffer from a condition called “zoochosis.” If you’ve ever witnessed a captive animal rock and sway back and forth, you’ve seen the disease firsthand. This condition is so rampant in zoos that some zoos give animals a mood-altering drug, such as Prozac, because the public has started to catch on."

 Zoos are businesses that capitalize on breeding, buying, and selling animals. Their main priority is profit, not animal welfare. 
 How do we know? 
 1. Because these penguins are on anti-depressants   .

 The Humboldt penguins at Scarborough Sea Life Centre have been prescribed antidepressants  because they’re so unhappy . 
 2. Because this giraffe was killed and fed to lions   when he had outlived his “usefulness.” (NSFW)

 Marius …. He was 2 years old. 
 3. Because a gorilla was shot and killed after escaping from an “award-winning” exhibit   at the Dallas Zoo.

 4. Because the Gaza Zoo painted stripes on these donkeys to make them look like zebras.

 5. Because in 2003, the San Diego Zoo and Tampa’s Lowry Park Zoo imported 11 captured African elephants from Swaziland   .

 Elephants are good for ticket sales, and even the biggest zoos steal them from the wild. 
 6. Because in 2006, several accredited zoos   imported 33 monkeys who had been illegally trafficked by poachers in Africa.

 They could have worked with wildlife rehabilitators to return the primates to their natural habitat. 
 7. Because 90 percent of public aquariums studied had animals who demonstrated stereotypic (neurotic) behavior   . 
 Convicts Cichlids  |  Deanpemberton  |  CC BY-SA 3.0 
 These included interacting with invisible boundaries, repeatedly raising their heads above the surface of the water, spinning around an imaginary object, and frequently turning on one side and rubbing along the floor of the tank. 
 8. Because from 2006 to 2009, Missouri’s Dickerson Park Zoo handed over “surplus” giraffes, zebras, kangaroos, wallabies, and exotic antelopes   to questionable entities. 
 JohnBallZooBongo  |  BeckyAnne  |  CC BY-SA 3.0 
 These included Buddy Jordan, **** a notorious animal dealer who is known to have **** sold animals to hunting ranches, exotic-animal breeders, dealers, and unaccredited zoos. 
 9. Because New Jersey’s Cape May County Zoo sold two giraffes to an animal broker   who then sold them to a traveling circus.

 10. Because when baby animals who are exhibited in the Minnesota Zoo’s yearly farm display grow up and lose their youthful appeal, the zoo sends them to livestock auctions   .

 From there, many are ultimately sent to slaughter. 
 11. Because the chief of veterinary services at the Cleveland Zoo has even   called on members of the zoo community to support the use of surplus zoo animals in  medical experimentation   . 
 
 12. Because a bear starved to death at the Toledo Zoo after zoo officials locked her up to hibernate without food or water   .

 They didn’t know that her species doesn’t hibernate. 
 13. Because a kangaroo at the Cleveland Zoo had to be euthanized after being struck by a train running through the exhibit   . 
 Kangaroosclevezoo  |  Pwojdacz  |  CC BY-SA 3.0 
 She was at least the fifth animal to be struck by the train. 
 These are only a few of the many examples  of ways in which zoos have failed the animals they claim to care about. 
 The solution is easy: Instead of supporting zoos, support organizations that help protect the animals in their natural habitat.

 The Truth About {SOME} Zoos - Argument Project 
 Published on Mar 29, 2012

 PLEASE READ. 
Holy hell people. THIS IS NOT MY PERSONAL OPINION ABOUT ZOOS. And I KNOW that not ALL zoos are like this. THIS WAS JUST A PROJECT I DID FOR SCHOOL. It is in NO way, shape, or form meant to harm anyone or "get everyone to think zoos are bad" or something like that. IT WAS JUST A STINKING PROJECT. Get over yourself. 
 I am SICK AND TIRED of people messaging me saying how I "have no right" to say these claims or that "they're false statements". I didn't make this stuff up. You want my sources?

 I'm originally from Puerto Rico. I was born in Santurce and raised in Rio Piedras. I currently live in Florida - since 1999. I have a doctorate degree in Medicine; completed in 1976. My Internal Medicine specialty was completed in 1979. Worked for Puerto Rico's health system until 1985. At this time, I'm happily retired after working for the federal government for almost 28yrs. I also worked for the government of Puerto Rico from 1979 through 1985 .... for a total of almost 40 years as a physician. I want to offer any knowledge that I have to anyone "out there" who is interested. My views are liberal in almost every sense. My knowledge is "eclectic" - a bit of everything. Music and reading are my passion. Blogging has also become a very interesting endeavor. Metaphysical topics attract me. I'm interested in news - reporting human issues like injustice, discrimination and abuse - the "wrongly" affected. My intention is to bring this knowledge to an understandable level and to help anyone in need. I'm open to questions and will answer them to the best of my ability. Currently working on an enterprise whose main mission will be to bring peoples of all walks of life together. To be one .... since we ALL are ONE!! The future looks bright and promising!!!
