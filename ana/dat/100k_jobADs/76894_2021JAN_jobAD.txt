  Job is Posted Again After Interview!  
 Work It Daily 
 August 06, 2009 
 Dear Experts, I had 2 interviews for a position at publishing company (I have masters in publishing), they asked a lot about my school in the 2nd interview, I inquired about my status a week later but they won't return my calls, job posted again and then again 6wks later, I am confused-help? I have glowing references and great education and experience. Have to admit my self esteem is dropping from experience. Not that many Publishers in my area so I don't want to discount any.  Here is how our T.A.P. experts answered this question:   Q#236  Send e-mail re u saw repost, still int'd in wkg 4 co, remind of ur quals, wish them luck; lv gd imprsn. ( @juliaerickson )  Q#236  May have been a matter of culture fit instead of skills/experience. Keep trying. Your job will come soon. ( @gradversity )  Q#236  I understand frustration, but let it go, move on. Energy spent consternating better spent seeking new opps. ( @dawnbugni )  Q#236  It's a subjective process. Sometimes no tangible rhyme or reason for decisions. Can't take it personally. ( @dawnbugni )  Our Twitter Advice Project (T.A.P.) is no longer an active campaign. To find an answer to the above question, please use the "Search" box in the right-hand column of this website.
