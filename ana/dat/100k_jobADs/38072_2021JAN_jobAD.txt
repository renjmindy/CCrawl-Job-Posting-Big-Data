 SUMMER PARTY 
 
 Our annual summer party is an integral part of our corporate culture. It offers a nice balance to everyday business life. In addition to varied activities, the summer always ends in great locations where also the physical well-being is taken care of. 
 EXCURSIONS FOR APPRENTICES 
 
 As every year, the trip with our trainees also took place in 2019. 
 Here the trainees can also get to know each other better outside the company and exchange ideas with each other. This fun is by no means neglected – this year there was a race in the Kartcenter Landau. 
 CHRISTMAS PARTY 
 
 We always end the year with the whole company at a nice Christmas party. A successful and relaxed end of the year is very important to us. Therefore, our Christmas parties always take place in a beautiful setting with a great meal.
