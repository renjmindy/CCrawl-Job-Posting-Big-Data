  What The Romans Can Teach You About Career Change  
 Melissa C. Martin 
 June 15, 2013 
 Ever heard those demonic thoughts that swirl in our inner sanctum and resist giving way to the one thing humans patently avoid... changing their comfort zone? Risks. Stepping out of the comfort zone. Making a  career change . Our inner temptations to make that change, even one small change, need a guiding force. Pay attention to those inner temptations - even if it means confronting the status quo! Quite often, the riskiest career choices we make are the right ones! Ancient Roman poet Vergil said, "Fortune favours the bold." (You'll often hear me refer to the Ancient Romans and Greeks. Those Roman senators were the precursors of modern career change). Let me explain.  Can you identify with any of these change-resisting thoughts to a new career? 
 
 
 A lack of purpose ( changing jobs  to go to a parallel position that may dissatisfy you). 
 Not recognizing your values (we use them everyday as our inner compass of decision making). 
 Not being honest with the truth (only you have control over your inner truth, not others). 
 Allowing external factors to influence your decision (friends or family who think they know what's a good career fit). 
 Not paying attention to the power of the universe and its energy (serendipity often affects career change more than we know!). 
 Not being able to balance action and reflection. 
 Haven't rehearsed a possible "exit" from your job (be an actor for once). 
 No knowledge. 
 
 Yes, the Romans were wise and paid heed to the above factors. (And we think that we're wiser in this post-911 age? Maybe not). What do you think? Photo Credit:  Shutterstock
