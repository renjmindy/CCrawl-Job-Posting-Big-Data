 As utilization of the three  Career Readiness Modules  continues to expand throughout Minnesota State, the IT Center of Excellence (ITCoE) has been busy making improvements to the Modules and laying the groundwork to introduce digital badges tied to the Modules. To keep faculty abreast of what’s happening with the Modules and badging, ITCoE is launching a short series of podcasts to help communicate important updates and viewpoints. 
 In this first episode, leadership from ITCoE discuss the importance of teaching career readiness skills to IT and computer science students, employer viewpoints on career readiness skills, the value of the Career Readiness D2L Modules to faculty and students, and an explanation on how faculty can utilize the Modules and digital badges in their courses. 
 ITCoE leaders speaking on this podcast include: 
 
 Wilson Garland, Executive Director 
 Janice Aanenson, Director of Academic Initiatives 
 Chad Eckes, Manager, Career Readiness Curriculum
