 Working Girl 
 Now I wrote this post while I was job hunting, over a year ago, and for some reason forgot to post it. 
 So I am posting it now. Since then I currently work at three jobs, all ones I am very happy to be at. But prior to that, it was a long, hard, rejection-filled process, 
 So most think that after graduation they will get a job right away. They studied hard, worked hard, interned, etc. 
 But that's not how it is. Finding a job is hard out there. 
 When I was looking almost everything either wanted me to give my time for free or have ten years experience. I guess I should have started working as a preteen. Oh wait, that's  illegal . 
 I mean have you ever seen  The Secret of My Success  starring Michael J. Fox? That movie speaks to me like no other. 
 When he starts trying to get a job, no one will hire him for his age. Too short, too young, etc. 
 It can be annoying.  Real annoying. 
 But one day you will find something that uses your particular skill set. 
 No I'm not talking about that. 
 It might not be what you were expecting. It might not be what you thought you would do. But you keep hunting and you will find someone something. 
 Hope you enjoyed that blast from the past Yep it a lot of nos, but then I finally got a yes (3) and I'm very happy at all the places I work at now. 
 Good luck all you still searching out there!

 On the 8th Day 'Til Christmas: Holiday in Handcuffs (2007) 
 On the 8th day 'til Christmas my blogger gave to me 
 Holiday in Handcuffs (2007) 
 This film is another one of those that goes under the clich√© of two people who can't stand each other being stuck together for a period of time; and then end up falling in love. This copies the film, _ It Happened One Night . _That is such an influential film that I promise you I will do a review on it. 
 So this film was made by abc family, a part of their 25 Days of Christmas. It stars the amazing Melissa Joan Hart; sparking her return to acting; along with the very handsome Mario Lopez. I had the biggest crush on Mario Lopez when he was A.C. Slater on  Saved by the Bell . (Although he was my second, my heart first belonged to Mark-Paul Gosselaar). 
 So the film starts out with Trudy, (MJH), being ragged on by her parents. In everything she's been in lately, she always has mean parents, it makes you wonder if they are really like that. 
 
 Hmm 
 Anyways, her mom is complaining about Trudy. Everything about her and she does is wrong. In fact, one thing her mother always complains about is Trudy's hair, so she decided she would get a perm "to fix" it. It doesn't turn out as planned as she completely wrecks her hair. 
 Because she was distracted by her hair and a phone call from her mother she also misses a job interview. 
 
 What else could go wrong? 
 When she gets to work, Raj's Diner, her boyfriend stops by. Instead of going with her to her Christmas Family Reunion, he dumps her. 
 
 Trudy has a complete breakdown, kidnapping the next guy she sees, David (Mario Lopez), and takes him with her. She has a 19th century gun, but David manages to slip on some ice making it much easier for Trudy to lug him in her car. 
 Trudy ties him up with pantyhose and her scarf. She explains the situation and starts to tell him a little bit about herself. She runs out of gas and has to go get some, but the attendant comes out to pump her gas and sees David tied up. Trudy hurriedly explains that he's her bf and they are going away for a weekend of "fun". He runs back to his store and Trudy hurries to pump the gas before he gets back, worried he is going to call the cops. As the attendant comes out, he gives her free furry handcuffs for her "weekend". 
 So every Christmas Trudy's family rents out a place for Christmas where they can be away from the world. No cellphones, phones, or any electronics are allowed. This year they are going to a cabin far out in the middle of nowhere. She takes David there, but first goes into the cabin to tell her parents that "Nick", (as she is pretending David is Nick ), likes to pretend that he is kidnapped and doesn't want to be there. When she brings David in, he starts yelling about him being kidnapped but all Trudy's parents do is laugh. When her brother and sister also come in, they have the same result. Trudy also becomes the key-master, in charge of hiding the phones and keys from everyone. 
 
 Trudy also keeps an eye on David, by having him share the room with her; telling her mom that she's old enough to sleep in the same room as her bf. They end up sharing a room with bunk beds. That night David tries to escape, and Trudy catches him, bringing him back to the cabin. 
 
 The next day, David catches Trudy on the phone, and the two fight over it until Trudy crushes it with a meat mallet. The mom lends David some of the dad's old clothes, which are too small, causing him to be the butt of everyone's jokes. When the mom needs something from the store, he and Trudy's dad go out to get it. Trudy tries to stop them, but everyone convinces her it will be great "bonding time". While the guys are gone, Trudy's sister helps her with her hair; straightening it out. 
 
 David and the dad drive out to the closest store, which happens to be the same gas station that Trudy had stopped at before. When David tries to convince him that he was kidnapped and needs help; the man brings out a shotgun and tells him to go back to the pretty lady. David complies. As he and the dad are driving back; David tries to take the wheel, almost crashing them. The dad puts David in a chokehold and calms them down. When they get back, David is so bummed that he is still stuck there he flings himself down upon a chair. When he does that, his too-tight pants rip, and Trudy's older brother comes to his rescue by lending him some of his clothes. 
 When he goes to get the clothes, David discovers that Trudy's brother Jake has a phone. He borrows it and runs into the bathroom to hurriedly call his girlfriend, Jessica. When he reaches her, he can say nothing; because she is too busy yelling at him for standing her up. 
 I am not pleased 
 David is finally able to explain by bursting out that he was going to propose. Now this part made no sense to me. Jessica is the daughter of David's boss, and used to the high life. And he was going to propose to her in a diner? 
 
 That makes no sense! You think he would pick something a little more classy than Raj's Diner. 
 Anyways, he tells Jessica that he's been kidnapped and to send help asap. Jessica promises to help, eagerly thinking of the ring she will be receiving. 
 By this time Trudy has figured out what is going on, and picks the lock on the door. She grabs the phone and tosses it in the toilet, but it's too late by then. David laughs at her, and promises that he will be the best bf ever, just to make things worse when her family finds out what she did. He proves to be as her family tells him of all of Trudy's secrets, has him put the angel on the top of the tree, make Trudy fetch David pie, and has him read  '   Twas the Night Before Christmas . Trudy becomes extremely upset the way that her family seems to like David more than her. 
 After they read the book, the mom has them write out their Christmas lists and leaves Oreos and milk out for Santa. Here Trudy and David have a heart-to-heart. Trudy tells him that she is a disappointment to her parents and David tries to console her. 
 The next day is Christmas, and in the morning Trudy and David spend the day out having fun. They play hockey and take a walk out in the snow. They both learn more about each other as David reveals that his parents died when he was about six, and was raised by his grandpa. He worked his way through college and studied architecture, becoming a developer only because there was more money in it. Trudy realizes that while her family isn't perfect there is plenty to be thankful for. She also tells David about the best Christmas she's ever had. One year she was supposed to be in an ice-skating performance and it was canceled because of snow. She was so disappointed, that her father sprayed water over the patio, icing it up and decorated the whole area with lights so she could perform for them there. 
 Later, they go inside and play chess where they have some more heart-to-hearts and David realizes how sorry Trudy is for kidnapping him. They also just happen to walk under some mistletoe, causing the two to share a kiss and start up some feelings between the two. 
 Later when David is cleaning up, he finds an album with photos of Trudy's artwork. She does a lot of portraiture; very post-impressionism style. Trudy finds her mom, and discovers that not everything is perfect in her parent's marriage. 
 
 When present time comes around nobody gets what they want. Trudy receives a pink sweater, as her mom buys her one every year; Jake gets a tie; the Dad gets underwear; the mom a case of socket wrenches; and the grandma a mug that says "World's Greatest Grandma". David got a backscratcher and Katie (Trudy's sister) a book of all the law firms in the nation. Trudy is also given a briefcase, which starts another argument about Trudy's need to get a "real job". David can't watch her parents be so cruel to Trudy, and interrupts telling them that her artwork is amazing. He also pulls out his ring for Jessica and proposes. It's so sweet and romantic. 
 
 Meanwhile Jessica and the cops have tracked down Trudy's friend and coworker to find out where Trudy is. They interrupt her and her boyfriend, and when the cops threaten her, she spills all. 
 Back at the cabin, all are getting ready for Christmas dinner. In fact Trudy walks in on David getting ready, getting a great look at his bod. All I can say is I greatly appreciated the writers creating this scene. 
 Right before dinner, David gets Trudy and tells her he has a Christmas surprise. He has recreated her prefect Christmas. He sprayed the patio so it was icy, and put lights up everywhere; and asks her to show him her ice-skating routine. She does and the two's love for each other is cemented, but neither has realized it. 
 
 
 Christmas dinner arrives, and all hell breaks loose. Katie tells her parents that she dropped out of school and has used the tuition to start a pilates studio in CA. Jake reveals that he is gay and has been seeing a man for a long time. The parents tell all about their marital problems. Just as all is revealed, the cops break in arresting everyone and letting the cat out of the bag about the kidnapping. 
 
 Everyone spends the night in jail. The next day they are all released as David chooses to not press charges. 
 Trudy realizes that she is in love with David, but puts herself into her painting, creating a piece about David's Christmas surprise. 
 Meanwhile David is starting to see that Jessica isn't the right person for him. He starts to reevaluate what his life is going to be like with her, and not quite pleased with what it will be like. 
 As all this is happening, one of Trudy's pieces is picked to be in a show. She invites her brother to come to it, and he brings along his boyfriend. At the show Trudy is surprised to see the rest of the family. The parents have been in counseling and all have promised to be more open with each other. Trudy's piece also gets sold. However, her happiness is short-lived as she is heartbroken over David, he got married the Saturday before. 
 Trudy leaves the show by herself, and is kidnapped. She is blindfolded and taken somewhere by‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.David! David is the one who had purchased her picture and came to tell her he couldn't marry Jessica. That not only is he in love with her, but she inspired him to create his own architectural firm. The film ends with the two being together; happily ever after!
