 What is a librarian? 
 Librarians oversee the proper functioning of various types of public libraries, school libraries, or law libraries. 
 What does a librarian do? 
 Librarians organize the library database and help people find materials and resources. Their responsibilities may vary based on the library they work for. For example, in large libraries, librarians usually specialize in a specific domain, such as administration, IT management, or the children's library. 
 Overall, general librarian duties include: 
 
 Developing and updating library inventory 
 Handling requests by patrons 
 Researching and implementing new information management techniques 
 
 When crafting your own librarian job description, it’s important to clearly define librarian job requirements and responsibilities based on the needs of the specific position you want to fill. 
 Job brief 
 We are looking for an experienced librarian with a passion for learning and books to join our team.

 To do this job, you’ll need to be a people person, since you’ll regularly interact with patrons and other library employees. Endurance and patience is also a must, as you’ll often handle multiple duties at the same time, for instance, showing people how to use the resources database or updating the information system. 
 If you fit this description and you’re also adept in shushing noisy patrons, we’d like to hear from you.

 Help patrons research reading materials and references 
 Answer patrons’ questions via phone or email 
 Publish and update content on the library’s website (e.g. book summaries, reviews, blog, etc.) 
 Research and implement new information system techniques 
 Organize activities and promotional events (e.g. children’s storytelling, author readings, book sales, etc.) 
 Manage library budgeting and billing for new equipment 
 Supervise library assistants and other staff 
 
 Requirements 
 
 Previous experience as a librarian 
 Experience using computers and working with electronic databases 
 Familiarity with information management systems
