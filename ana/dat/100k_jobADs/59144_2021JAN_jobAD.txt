  Job Search Motivation From A-Z  
 Melissa C. Martin 
 August 11, 2013 
 How's your  job search motivation  these days? While job seekers experience setbacks, disappointments, or perceived failures, their motivational compass needs to be recharged. With the countless negatives a (long) job search entails, how do can job seekers stay motivated? Consider these tips from A to Z and how they apply to job seekers:  A  -  Achieve your dreams . Avoid negative people, things and places. Eleanor Roosevelt once said, “the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.”  B  -  Believe in your self, and in what you can do . When was the last time that you reviewed your successes, accomplishments, skills and qualifications?  C  –  Consider things on every angle and aspect . Motivation comes from determination. To be able to understand life, you should feel the sun from both sides. If your job search is not yielding results, change the approach and take risks.  D  –  Don’t give up and don’t give in . Thomas Edison failed once, twice, more than thrice before he came up with his invention and perfected the incandescent light bulb. Make motivation your steering wheel.  E  –  Enjoy . Learn as if you’ll live forever.  Motivation  takes place when people have intrinsic goals (inward).  F  –  Family and Friends are life’s greatest treasures . Don’t lose sight of them. They can be your best supports in a long job search.  G  –  Give more than what is enough . Where does motivation and self- improvement take place, at work? At home? At school? It happens when you exert extra effort in doing things.  H  –  Hang on to your dreams . The "little" stars in your dreams may be your driving force.  I  –  Ignore those who try to destroy you . Don’t let other people to get the best of you. Resist the comopany of toxic people – the kind of friends who dislike hearing about your successes. True friends will applaud your efforts and act as your bellweather of support.  J  –  Just be yourself . The key to success is to be yourself. And the key to failure is to try to please everyone. For example, if you are unable to land two interviews in a week, reconfigure goals that are realistic.  K  –  Keep trying no matter how hard life may seem . Realize that unemployment is temporary. Eventually, it will be in your control, and that's why you need to gauge your intrinsic motivational levels.  L  –  Learn to love your self.  Now isn’t that easy? Quite often, layoffs, for example, are not a reflection of you, but the dour economy.  M  –  Make things happen.  Motivation is when "your dreams are put into work clothes." (Sorry, I cannot claim this phrase. I do not know its original author).  N  –  Network strategically . Most jobs are not are never advertised (up to 85%). The larger your network, the more motivated you will be to keep your job search fresh and active.  O  –  Open your eyes . People should learn the horse attitude and horse sense. They see things in two ways: how they want things to be, and how they should be. Reflect on things that have gone well so far.  P  –  Practice makes perfect . Practice is about motivation. It lets us learn repertoire and ways to recover from our mistakes.  Q  –  Quitters never win . And winners never quit. So, choose your fate – are you going to be a quitter? Or a winner?  R  –  Ready yourself . Motivation is also about preparation. Goal achievers know this fact intimately.  S  –  Stop procrastinating . Set goals. Only three percent of adults write down their goals. Use job search management resources such as JibberJobber.com  T  –  Take control of your life . Discipline or self-control is symbiotic with motivation. Both are key factors in self- improvement. Develop a  360 degree job search marketing plan , which includes social networks.  U  –  Understand others . If you know very well how to talk, you should also learn how to listen. Yearn to understand first, and to be understood second.  V  –  Visualize it . Athletes are well known for visualizing success. You can do the same to boost your motivation levels.  W  –  Want it more than anything . Dreaming means believing.  X  –  X Factor is what will make you different from the others . When you are motivated, you tend to put on “extras” on your life like extra time for family, extra help at work, extra care for friends, and so on.  Y  –  You are unique . No one in this world looks, acts, or talks like you. Value your life and existence, because you’re just going to spend it once. See your USP (unique selling points) to potential employers, recruiters, hiring managers and contacts.  Z  –  Zero in on your dreams and go for it!!!  Photo Credit:  Shutterstock
