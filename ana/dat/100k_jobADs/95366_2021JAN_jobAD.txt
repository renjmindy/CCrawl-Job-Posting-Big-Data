 Tessian 
 Tessian protects every business's mission by securing the human layer. 
 We're building intelligent security that works for human beings _  as they are_, not how security policies would like them to be. Using machine learning technology, Tessian automatically predicts and eliminates advanced threats on email caused by human error - like data exfiltration, accidental data loss, business email compromise and phishing attacks - with minimal disruption to employees' workflow. As a result, employees are empowered to do their best work, without security getting in their way. 
 Founded in 2013, Tessian is backed by renowned investors like Sequoia, Accel and Balderton and has hubs in San Francisco, Boston, and London. 
 Design at Tessian 
 We're looking for a Visual Designer to join our stellar design team, to sit within and work closely with Marketing to deliver groundbreaking artistry that both respects our brand guidelines and continues to scale the Tessian brand story to a global audience. 
 You'll communicate the Tessian narrative through a variety of assets across internal and external channels, and you'll be responsible for managing stakeholders and project timelines as they request design work. 
 This could include working alongside Marcomms to lead the visual identity of our research reports, collaborating with Product Marketing on product launch websites, or running branded ad campaigns with our Demand Generation team. You'll be an integral part of helping marketing deliver on their KPIs.
