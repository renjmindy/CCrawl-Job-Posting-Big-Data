 A 23-year-old Chicago man's job search will continue after he sent naked selfies to the human resources manager of at a company where he had just been offered a job. 
 Yikes. I mean, we know you’re supposed to send a thank you note after an interview, of course, but this is ridiculous. 
 Actually, the man says it was a mistake. He meant to send the selfies to someone else. 
 The story goes that the human resources manager informed police earlier this month that the individual had sent her two nude photographs of himself. 
 "There was a conditional offer of employment made to this particular applicant," Elmhurst Police Chief Michael Ruth told the Chicago Tribune. But then, "He texted the HR director and sent a nude photo of himself." 
 I’m guessing his face wasn’t in the shots because it wasn’t until he followed up with a phone call the next morning that “company officials saw the number on the caller ID and realized he was the nude selfie sender.” 
 Police contacted the man who admitted to sending the photographs but said "they were actually meant for another individual and were sent to the victim in error," the police report states. "(Police) advised the offender to cease any contact with the victim." 
 They didn’t pursue charges but Ruth said, “My understanding is they've rescinded the offer of employment.” 
 He also said his department is seeing more sexting-related mishaps. 
 "We're seeing it much more often now with our young people sending inappropriate photos of themselves," he said. "They're sharing it with someone else and the next thing you know it takes on a life of its own." 
 OK, seriously kids, you’ve got to keep your naked selfies and your job communications clearly labeled and maybe even on separate devices. Also, is everyone out there taking naked pictures of themselves? It seems like a weird thing to do. But maybe we’re just old fogies around here. 
 Anyway, career tip of the day: don’t sent naked pictures of yourself to the HR manager. We hope you learned a valuable lesson here today.
