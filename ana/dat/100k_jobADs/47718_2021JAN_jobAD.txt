 Job 21 
 1 But Job answered and said, 
 2 Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations. 
 3 Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on. 
 4 As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled? 
 5 Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth. 
 6 Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh. 
 7 Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power? 
 8 Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes. 
 9 Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them. 
 10 Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf. 
 11 They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance. 
 12 They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ. 
 13 They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave. 
 14 Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. 
 15 What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him? 
 16 Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 
 17 How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger. 
 18 They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away. 
 19 God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it. 
 20 His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty. 
 21 For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst? 
 22 Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high. 
 23 One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet. 
 24 His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow. 
 25 And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure. 
 26 They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them. 
 27 Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me. 
 28 For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked? 
 29 Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens, 
 30 That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath. 
 31 Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done? 
 32 Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb. 
 33 The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him. 
 34 How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?

 We have no control over what happens to us most of the time. The only thing we have complete control over is our attitude and how we process our thoughts. Jobs biggest mistake what's my name again to question God about what was happening to him. When we lose faith and trust in the Almighty our heart begins to be affected. When going through a trial we must be careful to guard our heart from our emotions and not allow it to be hardened thru it. There is something to gain and learn from everything we go through.

 Verse 34 ERV “So your empty words are no comfort to me. There is no truth at all in your answers!” Accusations do not bring comfort or peace to a soul; but, are merely that….accusations! Sometimes a mere hand shack, a smile, or a good hug (if appropriate) is more comforting than a cliche of speeches. Lord help us to know when to keep quiet and when to speak. A well guided prayer missile will hit its target better than a misguided torpedo that explodes upon impact. 
 Ecclesiastes 3:7 NLT "A time to tear and a time to mend. A time to be quiet and a time to speak."

 FIRST THE KINGDOM 
THE KING IS LORD 
 22 Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high. 
 Living in our day, this seems to be a valid question to a society that knows not GOD. There seem to be many people alive that believe that they know more than GOD. With repeated rejection of the WORD of GOD and HIS Holy ways. 
 With what we are witness to unfolding in these last days in the "christian" people. The approval of homosexuality, abortion and unification of religion with muslims, buddhists, catholics and protestants uniting together. It is a definite sign that many are not reading and obey the WORD of GOD. 
 We must hold fast to the teaching of the apostles doctrine of the New Birth salvation and a lifestyle of holiness. We cannot teach GOD anything. HE alone in judge. 
 Lets share HIS GOspel message today and invite people to serve HIM. Miracle Revival begins tonight at 7:30. Dont miss anything HE is doing; come to receive your MIRACLE. In JESUS name.

 Never make assumptions. Just because something looks a certain way doesn’t mean that’s what it is. You never know the full situation. How can we pass judgement on someone without all the facts and based on our own opinions? We shouldn’t be judging in the first place. “Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:” 
‭‭Luke‬ ‭6:37‬ ‭KJV‬‬

 Psalm 49: 
6. They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; 
 7. None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him: 
 8. (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:) 
 9. That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption. 
 10. For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others. 
 16. Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased; 
 17. For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him. 
 18. Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself. 
 19. He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.

Sometimes there’s a burning in our spirit that says I gotta get this across I gotta tell them this Word. I gotta tell them the truth. I experience this at work. 9/10 I have no idea how people are gonna respond to a little bit of preaching of Jesus name baptism or the oneness of God, but the Holy Ghost helps me with that boldness and says who cares if they mock you at least you’re giving them truth. At least you’re telling them my word. Let’s be bold in Jesus name and reach these people.

 Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done? Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb. The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him. 
Job 21:31‭-‬33 KJV 
 https://bible.com/bible/1/job.21.31-33.KJV 
 How can I declare my way to God. I can't; this isn't a my way or the highway situation. I cant have it my way and be faithful to God. That is a lot of mantality in the world. Oh yeah, go to church and then do as you please it's ok. It's not ok; there are steps that have to be followed in the bible. Be in the world, but not of the world. Greater is He that is in me; than he tha is in the world. How can I repay what has been done for me. I'm not sure if there is a way to repay God for all that he has done for me. I feel like the clods of the valley at times. 
clod 
From an unused root meaning to pile together; a lump of clay -- clod. 
I feel like that unmolded lump of clay that is just lying around waiting for the potter's wheel. How can I be shaped and formed if I'm not doing my part. Yeah I can receive and learn, but what benefit do I get if I just brush it off like dust on my clothes. Lord help me and continue to mold me. Thank you Jesus.

 https://bible.com/bible/1/job.21.14-15.KJV 
 It's sad, some people wont do anything unless it benefits them in a monetary way, and they wont help anyone unless it makes them a profit, I understand if I pray and seek First the Kingdom, God will provide, some people may beleive that the time they spend praying is taking away from the money they can be making, or their productivity which leads to making money. The bible says the love of Money is the root of all evil, so why place our trust in something that in the end has no value! 
 For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.

 Bear with me, and let me speak. After I have spoken, you may resume mocking me. “My complaint is with God, not with people. I have good reason to be so impatient. Look at me and be stunned. Put your hand over your mouth in shock. When I think about what I am saying, I shudder. My body trembles. 
Job 21:3‭-‬6 NLT 
 https://bible.com/bible/116/job.21.3-6.NLT 
 Job is venting his frustrations, but he's doing it to the wrong people. I don't ever like to come to the throne of God with complaints, but we have that ability. If I'm distraught about something I can approach my Father and King about whatever is troubling my heart. He is always so straight forward and kind. If I have the wrong mentality then He corrects me. If I'm needing answers then one way or another He gives them to me. Thank You Lord for allowing me to come before You with anything, unashamed.

 And yet they say to God, ‘Go away. We want no part of you and your ways. Who is the Almighty, and why should we obey him? What good will it do us to pray?’ (They think their prosperity is of their own doing, but I will have nothing to do with that kind of thinking.) 
Job 21:14‭-‬16 NLT 
 Unfortunately this is the thought process of a cast majority of our world. It's easier to belittle life to merely moments on earth that you get to determine the course of. But the truth is that we all have a God to face when we pass from this life. This life is what determines our eternity and too often people forget that! We consider benefits to decisions and ideas that will prosper us on this earth, but what with spiritually benefit us? Do we seek to gain spiritual ground too? Job said he will have no part in this thinking - be as Job today. Be firm, be bold, be prayerful, and seek ye first the Kingdom!

 “But who are we to tell God how to run his affairs? He’s dealing with matters that are way over our heads. …Naively you claim that the castles of tyrants fall to pieces, that the achievements of the wicked collapse. 
Job 21:22‭, 28 MSG 
 Job's argument is sound: it's naive to think that you can judge a person's standing with God by their current circumstances. Things are not always as we think they should be. Situations are never as cut and dried as we imagine. God's ways are not our ways. His thoughts inconceivable to us. Sometimes the wicked prosper, the righteous suffer, sin is pleasurable, and worship is a sacrifice. He is dealing with matters way above our heads, and we must trust in Him. 
 The Earth is not meant to be fair. We cannot look at others and judge them, or judge ourselves by them. It is enough that we look to God and align our spirits with His sovereignty, believing that, whether we understand it or not, He is always working for our good.

 AMP - 16 “But notice, the prosperity of the wicked is not in their hand (in their power); The counsel of the wicked [and the mystery of God’s dealings with the ungodly] is far from my comprehension. 
 At times, when our eyes are looking through our carnality, we might feel the same way - the people of the world are blessed with great jobs and success, while God's people seem to have the "poverty" "woe is me" mentality. 
 That is not God. Whether I am well or sick, rich or poor, I am a child of King. Many times we live way below our privilege, but whether we are saved or unsaved, the bible says it rains on the just as well as the unjust. We many not see the struggles that people of the world go through, but for sure they have struggles just like we do. When we begin to feel like we are the underdog, we need to go to the SAVIOR in prayer and ask Him to reveal to us the situation through His eyes. He sees the end from the beginning and every little detail in between. 
 Don't judge others, saved or unsaved, because you are not walking in their footsteps.

 What a sad statement spoken by some. Maybe out of ignorance. Maybe traditionally what has been passed down to them from generations to generations.. Or they truly are not wanting any part of God. We live in a day that everyone thinks there answer is the correct one . How glorious we can say have you had a look at the Book. Again there has to be a willingness. Again sadness floods my heart . A mere invitation to someone the other day and the first words back to me “we are not religious people”…..my comment you don’t have to be religious to come to church. My prayer is that a true relationship would grip their hearts . Before they say we don’t want any knowledge of God and then they too will hear “Depart I never knew you”! Lord lead us to those seeking knowledge and wanting to find answers before it is too late . In Jesus name.

 It doesnt take much to see, that our world is in trouble. It seems that every time you read about something in the news, it goes against the very being of God. In a time where people are doing what feels right, and is right in their own sight. We need a God move. We need the Holy Ghost Fire to fall and consume our altars and everything around it. We have to prepare it for that Fire. As we begin our journey , the next few months, in 40 days. I am challenged to seek ever deeper for God, and where His Spirit is leading me. May the fire of my altar never burn out, that I may keep it burning hotter. We need God in our world and it will start with us. When we have the Fire, then other will catch fire around us.

 Their mentality is this: “Your ways are painful, therefore we desire to live by our flesh. We desire to follow our will and not Yours.” 
 This is such a dangerous state of mind to live in. Because no matter how painful the process, His plans, His Will, will always have the greater outcome! 
 “For I know the plans I have for you,” says the Lord. “They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope.”

 The Grass is not always greener on the other side- 
 7Why do the wicked live on, 
growing old and increasing in power? 
8They see their children established around them, 
their offspring before their eyes. 
9Their homes are safe and free from fear; 
the rod of God is not on them.NIV 
 Job was asking these questions while feeling tormented by God. He felt as though he was being so troubled that everyone that was wicked was prospering. But when we as Christians feel that way we need to look at it from God’s viewpoint. 
 Everything that glitters is not always gold. We must never feel as though we are being punished and not allowing to prosper. The scripture states that if we seek first the kingdom and his righteousness, that all these things shall be given unto you. We have to place God first in our priorities and life. We have to make sure nothing else takes precedence 
 Mark 12:30 states- 
Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.' 
 I live the kingdom!

 I like the way Job tells them to stop talking! But what he is telling them is that his complaint is with God and he is not complaining to them. He is maintaining his integrity to God and they cannot understand his affliction any more than Job does. This reminds us that there are some situations that we do not understand and that we must endure and wait on God. God does not let Job, a righteous man, know what he is doing nor the purpose of his trial. Waiting on the Lord- serving him despite your situation, renews our strength. We can take our plight to God in prayer and be like Job.

 iLove the Kingdom 
 Morning Ya'll 
So this morning as I was studying the Word I came across a revelation. Yep, Ole Job's name in ancient Hebrew is powerful. Wonder what mamma was thinking… The root of his name is as follows: 
 H347 (Strong) 
אִיּוֹב 
'ı̂yôb 
From H340; hated (that is, persecuted); Ijob, the patriarch famous for his patience: - Job. 
 Wow. With a name that hints at being hated, I wonder if at the time of his birth his momma felt hated, or if she hated him for his unplanned arrival. Nevertheless, I feel like Job refused to allow what folks called him (or what his momma named him) to affect his heart. We find that no matter who hated and persecuted him that he somehow would overcome the trials of life. 
 Job makes an interesting comment in Job 21:15. He is declaring that the following statement is how the evil folk think. "What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?" 
 I know that there are no saved folk in church that would audibly make that statement…We all know there is profit in prayer. But if we all truly believed that there was "profit" in prayer then we would all get a "Job" and Go Pray. Many are spiritually broke and overdrawn because the prayer bank is depleted. True, we all "hate" to get up from our peaceful sleep and go pray…sure we hate to strain our vocals and pay the price in prayer…but prayer takes work and when you work, that means you have a "Job" and we know that Job in the Hebrew means "hated". 
 Conclusion: 
Noone said that having a Job would be easy. Prayer is work and most of the time work is not easy. Regardless, don't despise hard work but embrace it. Make your lazy carcass get up and pray…Force your flesh to do what it don't wanna do…and learn to be happy when you are doing it. 
 Jas 5:11 Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.

 Regardless of our class, race, or gender. We will all lay in the same dust of the earth, and face the same judgment. 
 Galatians 6:4-6 (MSG) 
"Make a careful exploration of who you are and the work you have been given, and then sink yourself into that. Don’t be impressed with yourself. Don’t compare yourself with others. Each of you must take responsibility for doing the creative best you can with your own life. Be very sure now, you who have been trained to a self-sufficient maturity, that you enter into a generous common life with those who have trained you, sharing all the good things that you have and experience."

 Many believe they are better than others due to wealth, fame or stature. They feel invincible to the things of life. Little do the realize, they will return to dust just like everyone else. Doesn't matter if your rich or poor, we'll all going to die. So worship and serve God daily, to ensure your path to heaven.

 Our time on earth is short compaired to eternity. I think id rather suffer for a short time then spend eternity in hell. Those who are wicked, living in there wealth and sacurity, may have everything, but where do they go after this life is over? Our time is short but eternity is forever. God is a just God whatever is done here on earth you will have to answer for. Wether it be now or later. So even if your at your lowest and you feel like life is hopeless, remember who your father is, remember that he has a far greater place for after this life as long as you keep your faith in him. As long as we have breath, remember that we are still covered by his grace. Remember his promise and keep pushing through, breakthrough the torment and look past the tribulations. God has plans that are far greater then our understanding.

 Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power? 
Job 21:7 KJV 
Job is sharing another side of the wicked where they are not judged right away and it SEEMS like they are getting away with it. The wise man also saw this type of unjust treatment:. All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness. 
Ecclesiastes 7:15 KJV 
Some men falsely believe because they are not judged immediately, they won't be judged. 
Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. 
Ecclesiastes 8:11 KJV 
Finally, even David got discouraged when he saw the prosperity of the wicked. that is until he went to the house of God and so there is an eternal judgement coming upon all mankind. 
For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me; Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end. 
Psalms 73:3‭, ‬16‭-‬17 KJV

Jobs terror 
vs-6 
All Jobs life he has shared the views expressed by his three friends. The disasters that stripped him of everthing have forced Job to rethink not just some but all of his beliefs. 
God has all the answers -though perhaps not the one we expect

 We must not be intimidated by the wicked. The God that we serve is more powerful and stronger. He is our refuge in the time of trouble. In him we can find rest.

 18 They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away. 
 Unlike the wicked we are to be anchored in God. So a chord that even when the storms come we are anchored. The Holy Ghost is what anchors us in him.

 1 But Job answered and said, 
 2 Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations. 
 3 Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on. 
 Because of the way Job’s friends kept repeating themselves and their arguments to him, it was easy for Job to feel that they simply were not listening to him. 
Instead, Job was determined to prove that he had listened to what his counselors had said. 
Job’s hardness towards his friends has not lessened at all, nor has their hardness towards him. They speak with sharp and sarcastic words to each other. 
 Job’s real point of crisis was his conflict with God, not with man (especially with his friends). His crisis was fundamentally spiritual in nature, much more than being a medical crisis, an economic crisis, a social crisis, or a family crisis. His struggle was against God, and he wondered where God was in the midst of this very dark time. 
Job’s friends looked at him and mostly accused and condemned him. He wanted them to take a step back (as it were) and be astonished at what had happened to this good and godly man.

 Who is the Almighty, and why should we obey him? What good will it do us to pray?’ (They think their prosperity is of their own doing, but I will have nothing to do with that kind of thinking.) 
Job 21:15‭-‬16 NLT 
 If dont have the mind of Christ, everything we accomplish and have, we believe its of our own doing. When in reality it's all due to God's grace and mercy that He allows us all our accomplishments. We must decrease so He can increase.

 Everything we have is because of Him, Jesus. He has given all our needs and protects us from the devourer

 Let this be a start the to our anthem as a church family. To all the naysayers and negative Nancys on the blogs, the websites or yelp reviews: Please listen carefully to the following speech and let this be a consolation to you, your family and whomever else you see fit.

 4 As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled? 
 5 Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth. 
 6 Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh. 
 7 Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?
