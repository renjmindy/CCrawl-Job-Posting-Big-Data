 Freelance Craft Developer LOCALCONTRACT 
 Job Description 
 We are looking to develop a relationship with a freelance Craft Developer that can be our go-to person to help us with the development and maintenance of our illustration studio's new portfolio site. At the moment, the site has been built on Craft and is about 90% completed, however we would like to work with someone to help us take it over the line. Immediate needs would be: setting up a small shop section on the site, helping us make any final design changes and generally getting everything buttoned up. Going forward we would be looking for help with maintenance of the site.
