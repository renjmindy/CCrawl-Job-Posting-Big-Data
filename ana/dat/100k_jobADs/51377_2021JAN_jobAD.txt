 "It is Not Your Job" by Caitlyn Siehl (repost) 
 On  October 7, 2016September 12, 2016  By  Christina's Words In  Poetry ,  Repost 
 when your little girl 
asks you if she‚Äôs pretty 
your heart will drop like a wineglass 
on the hardwood floor 
part of you will want to say 
of course you are, don‚Äôt ever question it 
and the other part 
the part that is clawing at 
you 
will want to grab her by her shoulders 
look straight into the wells of 
her eyes until they echo back to you 
and say 
you do not have to be if you don‚Äôt want to 
it is not your job 
both will feel right 
one will feel better 
she will only understand the first 
when she wants to cut her hair off 
or wear her brother‚Äôs clothes 
you will feel the words in your 
mouth like marbles 
you do not have to be pretty if you don‚Äôt want to 
it is not your job

 (I will be on a digital hiatus/detox during October. I 'll be running a collection of previously posted material from 2014, the first year of Words. Hopefully it will be new or nearly new to most of you. I may be slow to reply to comments or emails that need response. Thanks for understanding, xo, Christy)
