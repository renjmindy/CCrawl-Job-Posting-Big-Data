 About us 
 At Perlego, we're working hard to make education accessible to all. In this digital age, we believe that anyone should be able to learn anything at any time. Knowledge should be more accessible, not locked behind sky-high price tags. 
 Over the past 4 years our goal has been to support students across the UK & Europe to access quality books. The next stage of Perlego is two fold: 1) expand our support to students globally, and 2) build a product that goes beyond the book, a platform that helps students study smarter and more effectively. 
 What we 're looking for 
 We're looking for a talented and ambitious Business Development Manager to join our Commercial team. You'll be part of our 'core-markets' team focusing on growth in english-speaking regions. 
 It 's the perfect role for you if you have: 
 
 3+ years of experience in a BD / Sales role 
 Exceptional communication (verbal and written) skills - you should thrive speaking to everyone from a librarian to a CEO of a multinational 
 Strong understanding of the best practices of B2B sales - everything from how to build awareness through to how to nurture and up-sell accounts 
 Consultative, strategic mindset (always thinking 3 steps ahead of the client, the team, the targets) 
 Data literate and analytical, can pull on relevant data-points to make smarter decisions to help the sales process 
 Excellent stakeholder management skills 
 Emotional intelligence and a collaborative, team spirit 
 Positive, resilient outlook on life 
 A hustler who respects quality. You are quick and get things done, but understand the importance of delivering quality work - especially when client facing. 
 Perspective with a sense of humour - sales can be tough after all! 
 You prioritise self-care and self-development 
 
 ⭐️ It 's a plus if you have: 
 
 Entrepreneurial spirit and experience in a high-growth environment 
 Experience in revenue operations and/or hands on experience with building best practise B2B processes 
 Have a general interest in books, reading and always learning new things! 
 
 What you 'll do 
 
 Expanding our B2B client base in our core-markets - primarily UK, ANZ, Africa and english-speaking institutions and corporates globally 
 Owning the end-to-end BD process - from identifying new segments, prospecting, outreach, negotiation and closing 
 Achieving sales targets - both your individual sales target & helping the B2B team to achieve the wider team sales target 
 Go beyond sales - understand that sales requires a 360 degree approach, think creatively about new ways to build brand awareness and drive revenue, working collaboratively with our marketing team 
 Be a product advocate - live and breath the product feeding insights and client feedback through to the product team for continuous development 
 Build long-lasting relationships - you understand that BD is more than just selling, you nurture and build your client accounts to be Perlego's biggest fans 
 Be data-driven - you understand the importance of data and use this to improve the BD process and strategic direction 
 
 Why should you work at Perlego? 
 Apart from our mission, we foster a unique company culture championing self-empowerment, personal development, direct communication and mutual support. We're proud of our  4.8 Glassdoor reviews  and the fact that 97% of our team would recommend Perlego as a place to work.
