 Munjoba: Kshetrapala Bhairava 
 Written by  mmpandit 
 Lord of the Spirits: 
 Munj: The spirit of a dead boy who has undergone the thread ceremony but not got married. 
 Munjoba: The story of a Deity who is the Lord of the Spirits and who revealed himself in a very dramatic manner to his caretaker family. This story is quite unbelievable and shows the Adrshya Jagat or the Invisible World…. something which looks like an empty space but actually is home to that which normally never reveals itself. 
 Jai Mahakaal

 Hi Dr Manishji, 
How do you appease this god or do the pooja? 
Which temple is shown in your movie?
