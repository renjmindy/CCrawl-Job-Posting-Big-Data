 My name is Wilhelmina Lundy and I am a servant of God, it is the most amazing job that I can do which is allow God to use and fill me up with his presence hallelujah!!!!! Okay I won't keep you long let's get in to the word. 
 Job Chapter 22 
 Eliphaz says to Job, can a man be of benefit to God? can even a wise man benefits him? what pleasures would it give the almighty if you were righteous? what would he gain if your ways were blameless? 
 Is it for your righteousness that he rebukes you and brings charges against you? your wickedness is not great? are your sins not endless? you demanded pledge ( to be protected covered) from your brothers for no reason. 
 Eliphaz says to job you stripped men of their clothing leaving them naked. you gave no water to the weary, and don't feed the hungry. you were a powerful man owning. an honored man, living on it. You sent widows away empty-handed, and worked the fatherless until they had no more strength. That's why traps are all around you, why suddenly danger terrifies you,why it's so dark you can't see. 
 Eliphaz again assumes what could have put Job in the position that he was in thinking he could neglected his neighbors. and that 's why everything going on has him trapped and why he fears danger because everything around him is falling. why he feels God snuffed out his lamp and left him in darkness, why he is in tears. 
 Eliphaz goes on to say; Do you think God can only see the tall stars that he can't see through darkness, he is in heaven blocked from everything that goes on. He asks Job will you keep walking the old path that you did, that evil men walked. They were carried off before their time, their foundations washed away by the flood.They told God to leave them alone!! What can the almighty do to us? they ask. Yet it was he who filled their houses with good things. so I stand distant from the advice of the wicked. 
 Eliphaz says that the wicked lost before their time when they rejected God. he says I would stay distant from the advice of the wicked. which is true you take that advice from those who reject God and you 'll learn quick that the wicked prospers only for a little while. Eliphaz though was wrong about Job walking the path of an Evil man he just assumed that because Job was going through so much turmoil that he must have crossed God. 
 Eliphaz says that the righteous see their run and rejoice the innocent mock them, saying surely our enemies are destroyed and fire destroys their wealth. Eliphaz says submit to God and be at peace with him and you will prosper obey his commands, if you go back to God he will restore you, Eliphaz encourages Job to repent. 
 Eliphaz and the rest are forgetting to listen to Job, telling a man who is telling you he didn 't do anything wrong against God to deserve what he is going through, puts you in the b=not being a good supporter category. I remember when I first began this walk the first things I learned was listening and Love. when helping others God's people or not he have to listen to them and then respond with love. this weekend I was on a prayer call and gotten some valuable advice, which was you have to learn how to Love the Hell out of people. 
 Glory to God, God bless you all!!! 
 Now for the important part , if you are looking for salvation, google, download the free bible app, or turn your bible to Romans 10:9 and confess with your mouth believe in your heart that Jesus was born man died on the cross and God raised him from the dead you will be saved. get yourself in a sound bible based church and enjoy a wonderful relationship with our sovereign God Jesus Christ.
