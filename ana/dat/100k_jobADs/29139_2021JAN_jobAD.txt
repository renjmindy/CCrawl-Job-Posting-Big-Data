 Pericoronitis should and usually does resolve on its own, without antibiotics. Typically, antibiotics are not needed for routine extractions. There is a chance of infection forming, but following the dentist’s instructions will keep the risk small. These usually include avoiding suction in the mouth, as well as food with small particles like nuts/seeds. The day after the extraction, gentle saltwater rinses can help keep the site clean.For the first few days, some pain and swelling is normal. After that, if you notice increasing pain or swelling, or a foul taste odor, or difficulty swallowing, you should contact your doctor to check for infection. If you ever have difficulty breathing due to swelling, seek emergency care immediately.
