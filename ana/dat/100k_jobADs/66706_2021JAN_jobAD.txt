 Jobs: Assistant Professor in Modern Middle East and Jewish History, Penn State (Nov 1, 2014) 
 Posted on  September 29, 2014  by   Aryeh 
 The Pennsylvania State University Department of History and the Jewish Studies Program invite applications for a tenure-track position at the rank of assistant professor in modern Middle East Studies and Jewish History. Research focus and teaching interests are open, but the successful applicant will teach undergraduate courses at all levels in the Israel-Palestine and Arab-Israeli conflicts and in the history of Ottoman and mandate Palestine. Interest in transnational, postcolonial, and other theoretical perspectives is particularly welcome. Ability to contribute to an array of global studies initiatives in the College of the Liberal Arts, focusing on the study of global conflict, cultures, environment, and rights, is a real asset; working with the Collegeâ€™s new Center for Humanities and Information is also possible. The appointment will be held jointly in the Department of History and the Jewish Studies Program, and will begin in August 2015. The successful applicant should be able to enhance the interdisciplinary strengths of both units, demonstrate an active research agenda, and contribute immediately to both graduate and undergraduate teaching. Normal teaching load is 2-2. Dedication to the undergraduate missions of both the History Department and the Jewish Studies Program is essential.  Candidate must have a Ph.D. in hand by the date of appointment. 
 Submit a curriculum vitae, a letter of application that describes current and future research, and up to three articles and/or book chapters  at  https://app2.ohr.psu.edu/Jobs/External/EVMS2_External/currentap1.cfm#53185 . Additionally, please arrange to have  three letters of reference  sent to Sandi Moyer at sjm1@psu.edu.  Application review will begin November 1, 2014  , but dossiers will be accepted until the position is filled. Questions can be directed to Ben Schreier, Interim Director of Jewish Studies, at bjs44@psu.edu.
