 Web Developer (junior/mid-weight) for full service agency REMOTEPERMANENT 
 Job Description 
 We are looking for a talented web developer with a passion for both front-end design and back-end performance. 
 You’ll need to have commercial experience of building modern, fast and responsive websites using HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP - and the ability to work with the rest of the Dynam team to create clean, usable and accessible web pages. 
 The job includes helping to maintain existing websites, but you will also have the chance to express your creativity as part of new web projects. Experience in using CraftCMS is highly advantageous. We’re interested to hear from developers who are passionate about what they do and who enjoy continually improving their skillset. 
 Dynam is a full-service digital agency so you will be working alongside our project management, marketing and design teams to deliver web solutions for a wide range of clients. You will respond to feedback from both our internal teams and external clients. Demonstrating your ability to listen to others and to communicate well about things like project progress and timescales will stand you in good stead. 
 Join us, and you’ll join a team that works hard and supports each other; our culture at Dynam is centred around being upfront, working together, keeping it fresh and continuous learning. We have offices in Inverness and Glasgow, but we would welcome applicants looking to work with us remotely as we are all currently working from home. We’ll supply you with any software and hardware you need to do the job.

 1-2 years commercial experience using HTML, CSS and Javascript 
 Proficient in PHP and MySQL 
 Up-to-date knowledge of SEO principles 
 
 Advantages 
 
 Experience of working in an agency environment 
 CraftCMS / ExpressionEngine website development 
 CraftCMS plugin development 
 Web design experience (although our designers do the majority of any design work)
