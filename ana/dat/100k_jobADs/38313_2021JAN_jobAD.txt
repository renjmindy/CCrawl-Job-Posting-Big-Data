 What is a School Administrator? 
 School Administrators oversee administrative tasks in schools, colleges or other educational institutions. They ensure that the organization runs smoothly and they also manage facilities and staff. 
 What does a School Administrator do? 
 The duties of school administrators may vary depending on the size and type of school they work in. For example, school administrators in small day care centers (where they may be the only member of the administrative team) have different scope of responsibility than at a large college (where they may specialize in a specific area). Generally though, School Administrators manage budgets, handle logistics and act as a point of reference for everyone in the school. 
 School Administrator responsibilities include: 
 
 Coordinating all administrative processes. 
 Managing budgets, policies and events. 
 Resolving conflicts or other issues as they occur. 
 
 What are the qualities of a School Administrator? 
 School Administrators are capable planners, possess good judgment, and are skilled in handling relations with various people (staff, parents, students, regulatory bodies and the public). A great School Administrator also has an attention to detail and conflict management skills.
