 Hello! 
 I have a huge farmhouse that is: 
1 x kitchen, living and dining (open plan) 
1 x butlers pantry 
1 x games room 
1 x formal sitting room 
1 x internal hallway with internal courtyard (U shaped with wrap around hallway)

1 x mud room 
1 x laundry 
3 x bedrooms with ensuites 
1 x huge kids bunk room

 I need renders for all rooms. I would like to do this in stages, 2-3 rooms per week or fortnight. I will need some changes made to the work once my client reviews. 
 I need a designer who will keep the designs confidential, not share details of work. If the work is of top standard, I have many more high end projects coming so will need someone to work with on a continual basis. 
 Thanks, 
Johanna

 Building plans and drawings required for a restaurant next to the h...

 We would like to open a restaurant on the harbour, and have taken over an existing building. 
 The building would need to be changed to allow for:

3. 
 Possible meeting rooms/ conferencing

 We are therefore looking at plans and renderings to give us direction in terms of the way to go. 
 We will then finalise the plans into building plans such that the renovations can begin. 
 We have attached some photos of the existing site. The total area is approximately 1500sqm, and has a basement, large open middle level, and a half an upstairs level.
