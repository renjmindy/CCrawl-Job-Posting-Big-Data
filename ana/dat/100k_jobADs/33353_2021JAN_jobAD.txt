 AND Introduction 
 At AND, we accelerate the development of digital capabilities. In practice, that means helping ambitious leaders and organisations build the teams, products, processes and even operational structures they need to close the digital skills gap within their organisation today, so that they thrive tomorrow. 
 Clients rely on our experience, agility and craft skills across tech and business strategy, software development and product management to address some of the toughest challenges facing their businesses. 
 We bring aboard thinkers, tinkerers, passionate software craftspeople and inspiring technologists to help us solve these challenges. Together, we’re united by a sense of pragmatism, purpose and a deeply-held belief that digital products and technology alone won’t transform a business or save the world: it’s the people that count. 
 About You 
 As a Regional Marketing Manager, you will be responsible for engaging with local leadership and ANDis to strongly position AND in the regional market, with the aim of converting that market profile into revenue. As a result you will need to be able to:Plan and execute marketing activities, in the North region, with the aim of: 
 
 Building the profile and presence of AND in the regional area; 
 
 - Identifying, actively pursuing and qualifying regional prospects; 
- Converting prospects into qualified leads to support the business development pipeline; 
- Deepening existing priority client relationships. 
 
 Work with the Marketing Operations Lead to define, agree and continuously improve lead generation practices in close collaboration with AND’s Client Partnerships team. 
 Deeply embed yourself within your Hub region, building strong stakeholder relationships with the Hub and across it’s Clubs to understand the local market dynamics, and networks - ensuring all teams are working to a clearly defined regional strategy and lead generation process. 
 Identify and surface stories, activities and outcomes within your Hub region that can inform and support wider marketing activity led by the central Market Impact team - from feeding social media updates to ideas for central events, content and campaign development. 
 Develop and create marketing-led sales enablement collateral utilising brand guidelines and templates for your Hub, including the timely creation of case study assets with the support of Market Impact. 
 In partnership with the Hub Event Planner, ideate and deliver a focused lead generation and awareness-orientated event programme to engage new prospects and strengthen existing client relationships. 
 
 To do this, it’s essential you are: 
 
 Experienced in B2B marketing with 5+ years experience, preferably with a strong background in technology and/or professional services. 
 Evidence of establishing and scaling lead generation processes, working with sales functions to map, define and optimise lead generation and lead nurturing cycles. 
 A marketing generalist with a deep background in business development and evidence of nurturing prospects across complex and long sales cycles. 
 Experienced in stakeholder management, and the ability to balance and direct competing priorities and needs across different Hub areas. 
 Be a passionate ambassador for brand and marketing, understanding the need for impactful regional activity balanced within a coherent, consistent brand. 
 
 Joining AND 
 From the work we deliver, to the way we serve and support our people, we work hard to ensure that there’s nowhere quite like AND. But joining a company is a two-way street: the fit has to work on both sides. So before you apply, here’s three key things to understand about us: 
 
 We’re built for people - like, real humans. Not ‘resources’ or ‘staff’. That means happiness and wellbeing really do matter to us, and we hate unnecessary hierarchy and bureaucracy. 
 There’s no well-trodden path ahead: AND is growing fast and forging a new trail. That’s exciting, and gives us all the autonomy and opportunity we love - but bear in mind it also demands focus, patience and resilience. 
 Diversity is a priority. After all, to build great products that a wide variety of different people love to use, we need a wide variety of people to help us build them. So diversity is more than a policy or a word: it’s business critical for us. 
 
 Still sound good? Great! Fill out the short application form below and we’ll be in touch.
