 Caregiver Jobs for TESDA Certified Caregivers 
 Posted on  July 17, 2009  by  caregiver 
 This caregiver jobs placement specialists is committed to serving the needs of Canadian Families. Originally, the said agency focused on placing medical professionals internationally. Now, because of the increasing need for qualified caregivers, they now specialize on the placement of qualified and caring nannies and caregiver jobs applicants with Canadian families. 
 Canadian families need the assurance that the caregiver they hire is completely qualified to perform their duties. And because 90% of the caregivers employed in caregiver jobs come from the Philippines, the said caregiver jobs agency decided to forge an alliance with TESDA or Technical Education and Skills Development Agency in the Philippines who in turn initiated a specialized training program specifically tailored to the Canadian labor market. The graduates of this program by TESDA are the only caregivers who are qualified to work in Canadian caregiver jobs. 
 The Philippines has always been a favorite source of caregiver jobs applicants willing to work abroad caring for children, seniors and persons with disabilities. They are talented and committed people who provide excellent care and support to Canadian families every day. 
 This caregiver jobs agency’s unparalleled standard of excellence and commitment to matching employers  with top quality caregiver jobs applicants includes mandatory completion of the TESDA Certification for Canadian Caregiver Training Program. All caregivers who pass the one-on-one personal interview screening process, reference checks, and criminal background check are the ones who will qualify for caregiver jobs placement through the said caregiver jobs agency.

 Jhovy, 
 At present, the Canadian government is currently not accepting applicants who are directly applying from the Philippines, Nepal, and India because the processing of papers in these countries takes almost 18 months and the Canadian employers cannot wait that long. But if you are applying for a POEA approved caregiver job for Canada through a POEA accredited recruitment agency, then it is possible that you may get hired especially if you have at least 72 units in college and graduated from a TESDA accredited training center and passed the TESDA caregiver qualification examination. 
 Thanks for visiting Caregiver Work Abroad.
