 Okay 
 Look At This! it's a Full-time job 
 Anchor Worldwide is looking for an ACD Copywriter in New York, USA. 
 About 
 We are looking for ACD level team with huge ambitions and humble attitudes. We have world-class brands to work on and no-name startups to make known (and lots of clients in between). We think faster with smaller budgets. And sometimes shoot and edit the ideas we pitch. We want smart creatives who are great with clients–and also great with their co-workers (no a$$-holes). 
 If you're a copywriter who is currently flying solo, great! If you've got an AD partner, fantastic! Singles and partners both welcome to apply. 
 We have an unconventional approach to work —so if you’re looking to burn time in status meetings circling back and putting pins in things, we’re not for you. If you’re good with selling one good idea quarterly, then we’re also not for you. And unlike the merger behemoths with their blended names and endless resources, here you will work with your own hands. As a team, you will craft gorgeous decks to sell gorgeous ideas. Nothing is beneath you. Or above you. Your success is our success. We want a team who loves their job, loves their work and yet always want to be better. If this sounds like you, we’d love to talk. 
 **Please note that on site is not a requirement during COVID. That said, we are looking for folks based in New York City.
