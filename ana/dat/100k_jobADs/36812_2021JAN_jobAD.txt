 The Best Marketing Advice I've Ever Heard 
 
 I am a huge fan of the  Content Marketing Institute  (CMI) and I believe that  Joe Pulizzi  and  Robert Rose  have been doing a phenomenal job of bringing insightful thought leadership around content marketing to marketers around the world. 
 I was reading a  blog post  on their site last week and they were interviewing Robert Rose and it gave me one of the wisest, most sound marketing advice I have ever heard. Just to let you know Robert Rose is the Chief Strategy Officer at CMI and he was talking about his new book coming out called  Experiences: The 7th Era of Marketing . 
 They asked him what was the most valuable advice you have given personally or professionally? He told them that his grandfather was a wealth of information and advice and years ago he shared this wisdom with him: 
 
 What experience have you created for somebody lately? 
 
 After I read that I thought to myself wow I can't believe how amazing this is! I paused and thought about it for a minute. You can use this advice for so many areas in your life not just marketing. But since I had my marketing hat on (or turban) this is probably the  best marketing advice I have ever heard. 
 Every day that goes by marketing now is becoming more of a customer approach, experience and service than just advertising. _The way people want to be  approached, engaged, acquired, and retained all relates to the experience  your brand provides for them. _Take any brand in the world, when customers think about them they relive the experience in the mind. Our job is to create the best possible experience we can through all the channels available to us in this digital business era. Going through that experience you learn a lot about yourself and your business. 
 My Instant Change  : The steps I now take in formulating my marketing strategies should have a great and meaningful answer to the question  " What experience have you created for somebody lately?" 
 Thank you Robert Rose's grandfather!

 Mark Twain for everyone! 
 
 I love Mark Twain. 
 There are so many quotes by him all over the internet but this one really resonated with me. When you actually find out why, your life changes instantly.

 Meeting Keith Ferrazzi 
 Had to share this.. 
 One of the books I really recommend is to read is "  Never Eat Alone  " by Keith Ferrazzi. You can look at it as a masterful book on networking or you can look at it as a career changing book. I had a career change after I read that book on building relationships and actually doing what I want to do in life. Working for Gartner I am very fortunate in meeting authors and great entrepreneurs. 
 This past week I actually got to meet Keith Ferrazzi.  He is definitely the way he wants you to be . Very generous, humble and smart. He has a new book out called "  Who 's got your back ." Just started reading it and its amazing.. Hope you will too.
