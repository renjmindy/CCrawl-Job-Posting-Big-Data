 How to Maneuver Job Searching When You Still Have a Job   
 Job Search 
 
 It being easier to get a job when you already have a job is more than just a saying, it’s a fact. A company wants to hire the best talent available, which usually means he or she is committed elsewhere given their skills. Exceptions exist, but overall  applying while employed makes you more marketable . 
 The actionable side of this, however, makes matters more difficult. In most cases, you won’t tell your current employer you’re looking elsewhere, which means you need to tread carefully through your search. Here’s how to maneuver through job searching when you still have a job. 
 Keep your LinkedIn Updated 
 Neglecting your LinkedIn can be an immediate giveaway when your job search begins. It’s important to take time regularly to update everything so there isn’t a suspicious amount of changes when you re-enter your job search. An employer may notice a better presence online and be alerted to your actions. 
 Keep It on the Low 
 Even if you have a close work friend, you should make sure no one is aware at work. All it takes is one rumor to spread that alerts the entire office and can cause bridges to burn. Depending on your reason for leaving and your relationship with your supervisor, you might tell them. When you’re applying and interviewing, leave off current co-workers as references and ask that your current employer not be contacted. 
 Keep It Positive 
 Inevitably you will be asked in an interview why you’re leaving your current employer. You might be having a terrible experience, but you can’t express it that way to the prospective employer. Work out your response ahead of time so you’re ready to answer the question gracefully and move on. A lack of preparation might mean you ramble, leading to more negative thoughts that ultimately reflect poorly on you. 
 Keep it Out of Your Office Time 
 As eager as you are to find a new job, don’t spend your days at work searching and applying for new positions. Similarly, try and schedule your interviews out of work hours. This way, your behavior isn’t suggesting potential changes. 
 Keep Focused 
 As you look toward your next venture, it can be easy to lose sight of what you’re currently doing. When this happens, you can become unfocused at work and ultimately leave on worse terms than you intended based on performance. You can’t predict how long the job search will take, so make sure you’re still focused at your current job.
