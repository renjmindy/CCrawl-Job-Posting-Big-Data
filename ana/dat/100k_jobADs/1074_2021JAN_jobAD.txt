 ABOUT URBAN 
 Urban is the wellness app for busy people. It's a way to book massages, beauty treatments, personal training and more to your door in as little as 60 minutes. 
 Founders Jack and Giles opened Urban (then called Urban Massage) in 2014, driven not only to make massage treatments more accessible to all, but also to make the industry more fair to practitioners. Connecting with clients through Urban gave massage pros a way to run their own mobile businesses on their own hours, taking home a much bigger cut of the booking fee for their efforts. 
 Urban's since grown to offer more at-home wellness services, having welcomed expert beauticians, physiotherapists, osteopaths and personal trainers onto the app to deliver their treatments and sessions to busy people across the city. The app now operates in London, Paris, Manchester and Birmingham. 
 To date, Urban's delivered well over 650,000 treatments, with over 3,800 practitioners using the app to earn a living doing what they love.
