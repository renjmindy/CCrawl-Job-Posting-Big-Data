 You can always type in the email editor freely in the language of your choice. However, if you wish to change the language of the selectable templates, choose the preferred language from the drop-down menu above the email editor. 
 For e-signature documents, you can upload templates in the language you want to communicate in. However, we recommend writing the template in the same language as the job for a consistent candidate experience.
