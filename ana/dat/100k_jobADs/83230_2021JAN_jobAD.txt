 The Smoldering Crater Set Before You 
 Oh what a rough week or two. 
 A very old WIP I did in Bryce and Poser. Not a selfie, but it's how I feel right now. 
 Special torture followed up by a work week from hellâ€¦ (84 hours in 7 days) has left me a mess. No writing done in that time, but a lot of anxiety over book sales and everything I should not be concerned with. Butâ€¦ it has been illuminating to struggle through this. I've learned how easily a single sale pops up your ranking, if only for a day or even a few hours, not to mention how important listing your book in the right list will help in exposure. 
 It is also surprising to see how Amazon ads work. Not what I thought, and certainly not as effective as I thought, but then again, that could be also because of my pricing. $3.99 seems to be daunting for many people, so I have an idea and if you are out there listening, I'd sure like to hear opinions. ðŸ™‚ 
 I'm thinking of splitting the book up into 3 volumes. Price the first one as free and the second two at $0.99. It will not have the same cover, just something simple, tasteful and elegant using the seal. Nor will it have the map. Those are the benefits of buying the whole book in one piece, but perfect for those not sure if they want to invest in the first book of the series. Opinions now accepted. ðŸ˜‰ 
 I'm also a little concerned with who to use as my POD supplier for my hardcover and paperback. I'm not thrilled with Createspace (because your royalties for their Expanded Distribution are beyond laughable.), nor Ingram Spark (For reasons not worth going into). Direct2Digital looks the best, but they can't sell on Amazon, so that's a big concern but it could sell on Kobo and Smashwords among others. Soâ€¦ it'll still be on Barnes & Noble too. Sigh. Plus the cost is looking as high as $15.00 for trade paperbacks! Yipes! (Most not for me) 
 Anyway, that's why the silence for a long period. I could not get around so many things. 
 BTW Reviewers! I haven't seen too many around save for a few of y'all who have been fantastic! They really do matter a lot for sales and rankings and promotions, so if you haven't done one yet on Amazon, Smashwords or Kobo, (or Goodreads if you use it) please do! ðŸ˜€ BTW, if anyone has had any problems purchasing on Amazon, let me know! Please! One person tipped me off that Kindle's and the iPad ap may not be accepting purchases for my book. That's just dirty pool if it's happening to others. Otherwise you can still get it from the other two main vendors. 
 Okay, nowâ€¦ the plan as it sits right now. Stop focusing so hard on book 1. Work a new cover image, and see about splitting the book into 3 parts for sale, cheap. And of course, I will be ecstatic if I can get 10 chapters done by this time next week, 5 by Monday. So that's the hope and the goal. I am going to be pushing hard to finish book 2's first draft by Easter again. So that's the big goal.
