  Facebook Career Fairy: Transition From Retail To Career in HR  
 Work It Daily 
 August 15, 2012 
 Trying to transition from  retail  to career in HR can be a challenge, especially without experience. We received the following career wish from one of our Facebook fans: 
 
 
 "I wish that I could find employment with little to no experience. I've worked in customer service (retail) during my undergraduate days, but now I've shifted to human resources for my graduate degree. I've been "between jobs" since I graduated in 2010. How do I find a position in HR with no direct experience? "My ultimate career goal is to get into employee development and conduct classes on how to bring out the best in your employees, handling problem employees, and so on. I even offer advice and coach a friend of mine who is a general manager on how to motivate and handle his employees, and it has truly been working for him (he won an award for best manager of the period). "I've highlighted my education on my resume with coursework, listed skills that I have acquired from previous jobs that would be useful in an HR position, and also used keywords to be located in the applicant tracking system and cater them for each job description. "Even though I'm 24 and will be done with my Masters soon, I don't want to go back to stocking shoes or working at a gas station! I'm seeking a career... I've even looked into internships with no avail... HELP!" - Kam
