 We Sent You to Stop the War: Angry Voters Try In Vain To Remind McCain His Job Is To Represent Them - 6 September 2013

 Here's the infuriating spectacle of John 'Never-Met-A-War-I-Didn't-Like' McCain at town meetings in Arizona, ostensibly set up for the quintessentially democratic purpose of letting him hear what the people who elected him to his job  want him to do, except when those people really don't  want  to go to war with Syria, at which discomforting impasse he pointedly fails to hear what they are saying and pointlessly argues that "Assad is a merciless butcher," even though they haven't argued otherwise and are making entirely valid cogent points about why that is not the issue. The most rage-inducing moment is a tough call: When his eyebrows lift in supremely patronizing dismissal of a woman's fervent call for diplomacy? When a Vietnam veteran  notes that the U.S. has likewise used chemical weapons - ie: napalm - and McCain responds, “Napalm is a terrible weapon (and) wars are terrible, but…you had an enemy, and war is hell (and) if you killed that enemy, you probably prevented that enemy from killing one of (our) people (and) that’s what I think is a bit of a difference here,” because apparently he never saw or even saw pictures of those napalmed children running screaming down the road? Or just the disheartening entire exhibition that is his hollow version of democracy in action? Appalling, all of it. 
 "Why are you not listening to the people and staying out of Syria? It’s not our fight.”
