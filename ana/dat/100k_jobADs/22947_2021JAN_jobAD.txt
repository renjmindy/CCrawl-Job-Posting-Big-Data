  Job Seeker Says: I've Got a Passion for NOTHING!  
 Work It Daily 
 December 03, 2009 
 By CAREEREALISM-Approved Expert ,  Melissa C. Martin   Dear Experts,   I’ve taken all the tests and can’t find a single job I’m excited about. I can’t imagine a job I would find interesting and no amount of money will drive me to do work that I hate. How does one turn around their complete distaste for work?  Dear dissatisfied, Surely there is something that  impassions  you. I don't know which tests you're referring to, but quite often, they refer to skills (which has nothing to do with what interests you). Skills do not equal interest.  Talents,  on the other hand, are entirely different. So let's start with that. What  talents  do you have? They don't have to be work-related. If you still cannot, answer, ask other people what you are talented in. Another way of defining talents is your natural gifts or what do you have a knack for? Friends and family can help you with answering that. Another option is to look at  motivators . Think about school or community projects. What has motivated you in the past? Can't figure it out on you own? You can take a quiz for  free  that will list your 10 motivators. Check it out  here ! Are there any social causes you believe in? Any charities that align with your values? ex: Red Cross, Cancer Society, etc. Furthermore,  interests  really tell the tale. Or simply looking at national occupational codes. Failing that. What books do you read? What movies do you like? What music do you like? Sometimes patterns from those things emerge. If you have a so-called distaste for work, try  www.fabjobs.com , which looks at non-conventional jobs. The last strategy is to ask people whom you admire or people who are working in a field they like, and ask them how they get to where they are now. Best of luck. There is something for everyone out there.  CAREEREALISM Expert, Melissa Martin is a bilingual career coach  who specializes in offering career counseling by phone.
