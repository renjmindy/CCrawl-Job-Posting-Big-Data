 Side effects of being AUTHENTIC -3 
 Posted on  April 1, 2017  by   AryaaAkshay 
 
 The side effects of shining one's authentic self are many! For starters, we really get to  enjoy the differences in opinion  cuz we agree no two people can think 'exactly' alike one hundred percent!! 
 N that brings us to end up  being our own best buddy!  Cuz it's not others job to get us..it's our job to get us, n their job to get themself .. 
 And when everyone is just getting busy being WHO THEY ARE, it doesn't matter what others think of you. 'Difference of opinion' ï»¿one can say, n just ignore it all! 
 It's important for one, to totally understand their calling, n urges! What do they like, what do they dislike.. Being who they are n shining that light out, is why we came here. 
 I'm just gonna be doing my business n taking care of how happy I stay! What others think about that is their work not mine ðŸ™‚ 
 What say you??
