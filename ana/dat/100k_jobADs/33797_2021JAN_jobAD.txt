  Will My College Job Reflect Poorly On Me?  
 Work It Daily 
 May 14, 2009 
 Dear Experts, I am about to start sending out resumes for a new job, close to graduation in December. I have been working at my school's cafeteria for the past 3 years for the Room and Board program. It is great during school, because all my living expenses are paid for less than 20 hours a week. I have a question about my resume, because I can't really put that I've worked in a cafeteria for the last 3 years and nothing else. Should I get a quick internship, and then put only that on my resume? Or put nothing as past work experience and just put clubs and activities I am involved in?  Here is how the T.A.P. experts answered on Twitter:   @heatherhuhman   Q#123  Agree w/other experts, but an internship isn't a bad idea. Can help determine if you like your field!  @dawnbugni   Q#123  Rez not about the job title, it's solid presentation of skills & benefits. Doesn't matter where learned.  @resumesrevealed   Q#123  Do put wkg ur way thru sch on ur resume; learned valuble CustSvc/Rel Mgmnt skills; own it; put postv spin on it.  @louise_fletcher   Q#123  Agree with everyone else - include work experience and talk about what makes you good at it!  @kgrantcareers   Q#123  List all experience and positions including clubs and memberships. Look @ job descriptions and customize res 4 jobs .   @gradversity   Q#123  Include all work experience & activities. It shows a lot about your character having worked through school  .   @juliaerickson   Q#123  Ditto others; call it "Food Service Associate" - 3 yrs gd record; what skills lrnd? also inc activities.  @keppiecareers   Q#123  Focus on key skills and accomplishments in job. Think service, team, initiative, etc. Leverage on resume.  @ValueIntoWords   Q#123  DO include current job; think: how did my actions improve productivity/efficiencies?  @DebraWheatman   Q#123  Cafeteria experience leverages communication and organization. Add it! Additional internship can help too.  @askamanager   Q#123  When you have little experience, what you DO have matters. Cafeteria job stays, but get an internship too if you can.
