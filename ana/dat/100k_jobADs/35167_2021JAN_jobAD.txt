 The Right Tool for the Job for Clearview Demolition 
 Posted: November 21, 2018 | Category:  Buying a Work Truck , Service Trucks 
 From his office in Chilliwack, BC, Travis Scott coordinates his crew of more than 40 technical staff, deploying them to work sites across BC, Alberta, and the Yukon Territories to tackle Western Canada’s toughest demolition and remediation projects. As maintenance manager and foreman at Clearview Demolition, Travis and his team have specialized in industrial and institutional building demolition since 2006. Clearview’s fleet of equipment includes a fleet of over a dozen excavators with hydraulic demolition and crushing attachments as well as several mobile crushers, all assigned to Clearview’s work sites across Western Canada. 
 Travis contacted Work Truck West to look into replacing his current work truck and trailer setup in June 2018. “We had worked with ShearForce, Work Truck West’s excavator attachment division, for several years on the equipment side,” explained Travis. “We were hoping to replace our current setup with a fully upfitted mechanics service truck as we were getting more and more jobs in urban centers like Vancouver and found it really hard to maneuver the trailer in tight spaces. Plus we like the accessibility of the tool cabinets from the outside of the truck as opposed to digging around inside the back of the box or in a dark trailer.” 
 The Clearview crew opted for a standard 11’ enclosed mechanics service body with a 5,000 lb hydraulic crane and 40 CFM air compressor and added a Lubemate oil recovery system, extra toolboxes, and a bumper vice for added functionality in the field. “We were really happy with the end result of this truck package,” said Travis. “It will definitely add value to our business and our ability to service our equipment in the field.” And the timing couldn’t be better with Clearview taking on more projects further from home base. “We cover a very large territory with our services,” said Travis, “the new truck will add some flexibility and assurance for our crews, no matter where they may be working.”
