 Palms employees sign petition to retain jobs after Station Casinos takes over 
 __ Marie Kelley 
 __ July 22, 2016 
 __ Latest Casino and Gambling News ,  Las Vegas ,  Labor Relations ,  Nevada 
 Station Casinos is set to take over the  Palms Casino  of Las Vegas,  Nevada  and current employees of the Palms want to keep their positions of employment. In hopes of doing so, hundreds of employees of the venue have signed a petition to maintain their positions as well as benefits and seniority once the new owner takes control. 
 Culinary Union  reported the petition signing on Thursday, alleging that Station had not offered a commitment in writing for job security of workers who already hold positions at the Palms. The positions in question include those who work at the coffee shop, the main kitchen and bakery as well as the buffet, all working for Sodexo, a food service company. 
 The petition was signed by hundreds of such employees at the Palms and was given to management this past Monday. Lori Nelson, a spokeswoman for Station, stated that employees were told they could keep their jobs as well as benefits and seniority, just hours after the purchase was announced back in May. Nelson commented this week that Station Casinos reiterated this promise to employees via a letter penned by the general manager of the casino which was handed out on Wednesday of this week. 
 Nelson stated that in the letter, the company reconfirmed that they are committed to the hourly team members and that reapplying is not needed. The employees will retain their original hire date which includes seniority, wages, title and position. The union would like to see this promise include the employees of Sodexo, with Nelson stating that Station had yet to address third party operators and is currently focused on employees who are directly employed by the casino. 
 It was back in May that Red Rock Resorts Inc., the parent company of Station, announced they would be  buying the Palms , spending $312.5 million in the process. The company would purchase the Palms from TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners with the deal still needed regulatory approval. The deal should be finalized before the end of this year. 
 Since 2015, the Culinary Union has been trying to organize at the Palms Casino and has been fighting Station Casinos as well. The group plans on sending the petition to several groups including Station, the Governor of the state, Brian Sandoval and the Nevada Gaming Commission.
