 On The Job Injury Attorneys Queens 
 At Polsky, Shouldice & Rosen, P.C., our  On The Job Injury Attorneys Queens  families trust are experienced in handling workers compensation related cases. So if you or a loved one was injured at work, or came down with a serious illness, then we suggest getting some legal guidance before proceeding further. There are instances where a lawyer may not be needed, but it’s better to have someone watching out for your best interests so you can get the benefits you need to recover. 
 If you want to find out what your legal options are and whether you are eligible for certain types of coverage under workers compensation, call Polsky, Shouldice & Rosen, P.C. today. 
 Not All Businesses Carry Workers Comp Benefits 
 The first step is finding out whether the company you work for has a workers compensation program. All states are required by law to have workers comp insurance, however, there are jobs that are exempt from this rule. People who are volunteers, independent contractors, business owners, railroad workers, longshoremen, gardeners, and farm workers may not be guaranteed workers comp benefits. If you are not sure whether you qualify and what steps to take next, contact our Queens On The Job Injury Attorneys for a consultation. 
 Requirements for Eligibility 
 There are factors that can make someone eligible or ineligible for workers compensation benefits. For example, you may be denied benefits if it is shown that you were under the influence of a substance at the time of the accident, intentionally harmed yourself to get money, or initiated a physical altercation with a coworker. Establishing blame in a workers comp claim is not so much important, as this program was created to reduce tensions between employee and employer if an injury accident were to occur. Other requirements for workers comp benefits include: 
 
 Your employer has workers comp insurance 
 You are considered an employee for the company (part-time, full-time, temporary, and seasonal workers are covered. Independent contractors and volunteers are not eligible) 
 You were injured or became sick due to job-related responsibilities (this includes situations where you are traveling for work) 
 
 Most Common Workplace Injuries 
 ** 
** Falls, trips, and slips are some of the most common reasons why workers compensation claims are filed. Other injuries that are common include broken bones, traumatic brain injuries, sprained muscles, soft tissue damage, lacerations, whiplash, and more. These injuries may have been caused due to faulty machinery, defective equipment, lack of safety gear, and unsafe working conditions. Additionally, workers comp programs cover medical expenses for people who have gotten sick after being exposed to things like asbestos and other harmful substances. 
 If you or someone you care deeply for endured serious and painful injuries while at work or when traveling for their job, then please call  Polsky, Shouldice & Rosen, P.C.  to book your brief free initial consultation with our Attorneys for On The Job Injury in Queens.
