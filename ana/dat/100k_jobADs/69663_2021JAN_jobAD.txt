 Princess Nellie and Major Stanley Jober 
 Major Stanley Jober  (1883-1958) was a diminutive immigrant from Warsaw, Poland. Estimates on his height vary wildly, from 36 to 46 inches tall. His wife was 30-inch tall  Nellie Frances Way  (1884-1941), billed as “Princess Nellie”, and known to be an accomplished violin player and seamstress. The pair played the Otis Smith Circus and the Mighty Doris-Col. Francis Ferrari Show. They toured the country for years in a specially customized truck, eventually retiring to Waterford, Connecticut when the Depression hit in the 1930s. They lived in a specially built miniature house, the foundation of which measured 10 x 30 feet.
