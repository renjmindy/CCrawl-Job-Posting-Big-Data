 Overview

 The Financial Analyst will be pivotal to the development of reports for senior management, who will in turn use the information to develop a range of performance measures and benchmarks to ensure sales activity is maximised and commercial decisions are well-supported with insightful data. 
 Key technical skills include advanced Excel & Business Warehouse, ideally with use of an ERP such as Navision, SAP or Oracle.
