 ABOUT THE OPERATIONS COORDINATOR ROLE As the Operations Coordinator, you are fundamental to Instawork's success. You will own your market. Your super powers are agile problem-solving, execution, people skills and business development. You'll nurture and grow partner accounts. You'll drive projects from conception through implementation. You are customer-obsessed, intellectually curious and excited by the opportunity to drive the company forward. We’re constantly innovating and refining our operations strategy, and you’re a huge piece of it. 
 We are looking for someone with the mix of operational prowess to get great work done, the hustle to build a business from scratch, the empathy and negotiation skills needed to bring out the best from partners and professionals, and innovation that's required to develop outside-the-box solutions. 
 Strategy, sales and account management, local operations, marketing, project management, marketplace analytics, and customer experience all sit under the operations manager's broad umbrella of responsibilities. To be successful you will develop a deep understanding of how to enter and ramp a market. This is where creativity meets problem solving and execution. 
 You’ll report to the Regional General Manager. The two of you will work side-by-side to make Instawork a success in your local city. You'll interact with Operations peers across on a daily business to learn and share insights. It’ll be a challenging and rewarding journey.
