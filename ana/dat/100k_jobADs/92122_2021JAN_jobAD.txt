 This global Multi-billion pound FTSE100 organisation is in a state of huge growth through ever increasing international demand and are gearing up for a record 2021. In line with this they are going through a period of group wide engineering improvement and looking at how they manage their manufacturing engineering assets and engineering processes to maximise both efficiency and reliability. 
 In line with this, they are strengthening their Asset Management team across the UK and now require the appointment of experienced Reliability Engineers to join their asset management team and support a number of the sites in the improvement of the overall manufacturing offering and to manage assets through their entire life-cycle supporting safety, performance, risk-consequence management and total cost of ownership. 
 The Reliability Engineers will define equipment criticality in relation to safety, productivity and quality impact supporting the prioritisation and selection of appropriate asset care strategies and tactics. They will develop and manage the programme of equipment inspection and repair whilst effectively supporting the engineering team to achieve target requirements in safety, production output, quality and cost. Working closely with the Planner/Scheduler to identify and rectify issues whilst improving the standards of the department and maintaining high standards within Environment, Health & Safety, Housekeeping, Performance, Waste, Communication and Continuous Improvement and support the Engineering Manager to deliver the key objectives and KPI's for Operations. 
 You will champion the smooth running of the Asset care requirements and be responsible for the development and ongoing update of the preventive and predictive maintenance program to meaningful analysis and reporting of reliability related matters. You will manage risk to an accepted level while supporting the organization's strategic objectives in the areas of environmental, health and safety, asset availability, quality and productivity. The Reliability Engineer will work with the Engineering team in the development, justification & delivery of CAPEX budgets and projects and will identify critical spares, service level agreements and timeliness in order to manage engineering inventory and optimise working capital. 
 The role will involve a strong input from both a PPM / TPM and Continuous Improvement perspective and will require a proven ability to gather data, analyse and problem solve in order to maximise reliability of all assets across the sites. You will have a strong engineering knowledge base and will understand the impact of decisions made from both a financial and process / end user perspective. The Engineer will lead by example and have a right first time approach and support the development, justification & delivery of CAPEX budgets and projects while generating and improving profitability through value engineering. 
 Ideally qualified to Degree / HND level in an engineering related field, the Reliability Engineer will have proven experience in Production support, maintenance, CAPEX and continuous improvement, ideally from within a high volume and fast paced environment. 
 The role offers challenge and opportunity in a truly global environment where the career development potential is unrivalled and where progression is available for those who deliver the results.
