 trust me, 
 it's my job 
 THE JOB AT BACKBASE 
 The primary responsibility of the VP of Digital Sales will be to boost sales results to new soaring heights within the North-American market. Following the founders’ vision, strategy, and innovation, the role requires the development and execution of a winning sales strategy. 
 1. Strategy 
The ideal candidate is a strategic thinker and an operational driver who ensures successful closure of the complete sales cycle. The candidate should be able to craft winning strategies aligned with the global vision and strategy and execute the go-to-market strategy and operational plans to surpass sales targets. The VP determines and monitors the department's key performance indicators, such as, pipeline generation, activity/contact rate, win/loss reasons, and quote closure rate. In addition, the candidate must be able to anticipate and react quickly in an ever-changing environment to clients in order to gain and keep their vested trust. Furthermore, the VP is up to date on market trends, customer feedback, and long- and short-term opportunities in the market. 
 2. Leadership 
The ideal candidate must be an exceptional sales leader, not settling for the ordinary, but continues to drive the team to overachieve sales goals. Displaying a high standard of behavior, earning the respect from external customers and partners, as well as from the internal leadership team and colleagues. 
 A very important aspect of this position is to support and drive the sales team to increase productivity and forecast accuracy - consistently supporting them on leading sales indicators (activities, pipeline, forecast). The VP is an energetic team leader, leading by example and constantly keeping a pulse on team performance and progress. 
The candidate will participate in corporate succession planning activities, write and deliver employee reviews, keep close looks on employee morale, and create a positive working environment in which the team can thrive. Hiring, training, and developing team members is an inevitable part of the job. 
 3. Sales Effectiveness - closing 
The ideal candidate should be a true hunter with the expertise to drive complex sales negotiations and closings to a successful end. The candidate will manage very large, high-profile prospective enterprise accounts as well as local based Credit Unions. Experience with crafting winning sales proposals is right in the candidate’s wheelhouse. The candidate will ensure sales employees are trained and equipped with the product knowledge, sales mechanics, and personal-skills that they require to be successful. It will be important to partner with other departments like marketing and alliance management to develop lead generation and revenue generation programs, and to create high performing sales collateral. 
 4. Continuous Improvement 
The ideal candidate should continually improve the effectiveness of the sales organization and enhance productivity, efficiency, and customer satisfaction. The VP will oversee and drive the adoption of sales tools, including customer relationship management (Salesforce.com) and other internal sales tools. He/She will also partner with information technology leaders to identify and implement new technology and improve existing technology based on business needs. Additionally, the candidate will improve, document, and enforce sales policies, standard operating procedures, and best practices, and continuously streamline the sales processes and demand the proper “hygiene”.  apply now

 Backbase Careers 
 you impact 
 an industry 
 SALES 
 Banking is changing rapidly. We’re on a mission to serve 10% of all smartphone users worldwide with a Backbase-powered financial app. Yes, that means 400 million people. Ambitious? Yes. Challenging? Absolutely. But we see it as exploring millions of initiatives and flexing our brainpower. 
 Our Sales team is a key element in achieving this mission. We are passionate about technology and customer-centric solutions. Here, we impact an industry beyond just selling software by changing the way people experience banking globally. 
 team  challenge 
 SALES 
 We are industry distributors. We know that our solution is the best possible in the niche market but if you think that winning clients over comes by itself, think again. At Backbase, you get to combine your passion for sales and technology to gain trust and understand clients’ needs. It’s not an easy task! It’s your job to work together with Solution Engineers and our Professional Service experts to explain to the biggest financial institutions globally how to drive innovation and provide a flawless user experience on every touchpoint. 
 Of course, it comes with additional benefits. Our Sales team is relatively small, so with your can-do attitude and entrepreneurial mindset, you’d be able to make a difference within the industry. A happy customer means a positive impact on the lives of millions of end-users around the world. 
 explore the world 
 Traveling is a big part of your job: whether you represent Backbase at a conference or onsite of the client, if you don’t have that frequent flyer card, you’d gain one pretty quickly. 
 high-value deals 
 Our clients are the biggest financial institution around the world. So you can imagine - the deals that we close are massive and responsibility is high. 
 ahead of tech 
 We believe that innovation should keep moving forward. That’s why we constantly re-invest in our product to make it better for our customers. 
 fun 
 Friday beers, yearly parties, team outings, Strong Vikings competitions, travels around the world. Here, you’d build real friendships. 
 team  structure 
 SALES 
 For the size of the organization (850+ people), we have a rather small Global Sales team, counting around 60 Sales Representatives in 11 offices across the world. Our SVP of Sales (located in Amsterdam HQ) is leading the team and strategy. Together with Regional Sales Directors and their teams of Account Executives and Business Development Representatives, they are responsible for achieving the yearly revenue and customer acquisition goals. 
 The majority of the Sales team is based in our Amsterdam HQ but we also have small local sales teams based in the US ( Atlanta & Princeton), Frankfurt, Mexico, Dubai, Singapore, Japan, India and Australia which helps us to be closer and stay relevant to the clients in the area.
