 Office Careers - Part 2 
 February 20, 2020February 20, 2020  /  Terri 
 Part 2 I'm adding a link to the second part of this story about Office Careers. I will say the workers comp legal community, myself included, have been raising concerns about Office Careers to the Department for years. It's a bit disingenuous for Rich Wilson to claim ignorance. More than a dozen times, evidence that injured workers had obtained no skills in these programs has been presented to the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals. 100% of those times the Judge has found in the workers favor. 
 If you are a injured worker, currently being retrained at Office Careers, and you have  any  concerns about your training program, I strongly urge you to talk to a workers comp attorney.
