 Huge farm fire in Sussex: animals rescued from blaze 
 Animals have been rescued by firefighters from a blaze at a farm in Sussex. 
 West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service said they were called at 9.30am last night (December 10) to a farm in Five Oaks Road, Slinfold, near Horsham, West Sussex, to reports of a barn fire. 
 When crews arrived, the blaze had spread to several buildings, and firefighters spent hours battling the flames. 
 Six fire engines and two water carriers attended the blaze. 
 With Christmas around the corner, the animals to be saved reportedly included turkeys, pigs and cows. A fire service spokesman said firefighters rescued livestock and moved them to safety in unaffected buildings. 
 No people needed to be rescued. 
 It is currently unknown if any animals perished in the fire. 
 Police and the ambulance service were on scene as part of the routine response to this size incident. 
 At around 2am today (December 11) the majority of crews left the scene with one fire engine remaining. 
 The cause of the fire is still being investigated, the fire service said.
