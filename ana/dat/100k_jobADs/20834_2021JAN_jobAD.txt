  4 Things Women Should Do When Choosing What To Wear To An Interview

 A key thing to consider when preparing for a job interview is what you're going to wear. 
 Although your appearance is not the most important thing in an interview, applying too much makeup or having the wrong accessories can hurt your chances of getting the job. 
 
 When you're in the interview, you should be focusing on your interviewer and their questions.  You don't want to worry about your fashion choices DURING the interview!  That's why it's so important to prepare your interview look ahead of time. 
 Here are four tips to consider before you decide on your next interview look. 
 Wear Something You're Confident In 
 First of all, if you never wear a dress, costume, or skirt in your leisure time, you should not start wearing one for an interview. There are also  fashionable business clothes from Lipsy London  out there if that's more your style. During an interview, it's always better to stay true to yourself since you are very excited (and sometimes even insecure). 
 Find The Right Shoes 
 Feel as comfortable as possible - even if it's a challenge to find the right shoes for a job interview. They should neither make you nor your legs extremely long, as you want to convince with your skills and not your looks, right? (And twisting your ankle when stepping into the office might not be the most professional look, so just keep it on the down low.) 
 Dress Like Your Future Colleagues 
 If you don't know if a business suit and heeled shoes will be the right choice, sit down in a nearby café a couple of days before your interview and take a look at your (hopefully) future colleagues - what are they wearing? Is there  any fashion trap  you might step into with your choice so far? 
 Don't Wear Too Much Makeup 
 When it comes to makeup and accessories, you should use as much as necessary but as little as possible - everything distracting the interviewer from your personality and skills might end in some attempts to flirt, but surely not in a serious conversation or labor contract afterwards. Of course - nobody should ever take a wedding ring off and if you have skin problems because of pimples, you will surely feel better using some light concealer. But there is no need for smokey eyes and pink lip gloss, so just underline your natural beauty a bit without exaggerating the usage of your vanity case. 
 So, good luck in your next interview! 
 Keep in mind to stay true to yourself and you will not have to blame yourself afterwards if it goes wrong, because then the company did a mistake!
