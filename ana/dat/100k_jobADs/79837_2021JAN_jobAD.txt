 #23 To Get A Job, Or Not To Get A Job 
 Posted by georginatait6 25th Mar 202026th Mar 2020 Posted in Uncategorized 
 I recently went to a talk, organised by the uni newspaper, about how to get into journalism. Here are the positives and negatives I took from the talk: 
 
 Free pizza and free chocolate fingers👍🏼 
 A good catch up with my old flat mate (👍🏼) whilst they sorted out the blown up projector which made them half an hour late 👎🏼 
 Right now, you need to be writing for Redbrick (the newspaper) and doing your own blog (what I’m doing already, yay) 👍🏼 
 Grades don’t matter too much, you just need to be doing extra-curricular stuff👍🏼 
 Show off your crazy side in an interview (to an extent) 👍🏼 
 You should probably do a post grad to increase your chances of getting a job👎🏼 
 The pay is usually shite, unless you’re one of a kind 👎🏼 
 
 So yeah, it was a bit of a rollercoaster, but overall, I’m doing everything right so far. The pay is shit, but I plan to win the lottery, so that’s fine. The only thing I’m not doing right, is planning a gap year for after uni. Instead, I should be deciding where to do my post grad. Problem is, I don’t want to do one. I’m only half way through my degree and I’m ready to graduate already. I’m DONE with education. Even though I don’t expect to pay back my tuition fees ever anyway, the idea of an even fatter debt does not make me jump for joy. 
 All my birthday presents must be lottery tickets from now on, thank you. 
 Ironically, the alumni at the talk had all not done a post grad, which gives me hope. They had all taken the hard route and had to do extra shit to get into the industry, but they got there. 
 And just being a student, ugh. The inner Queen in me is crying - I need to be living up in my castle, getting fed Oreos and having my toe nails painted. My body can’t cope with unlimited washing up, cheap Aldi crisps and 9am lectures for much longer. 
 To be fair, these are peng from Aldi, but I want to be able to spend a stupid amount of money on crisps and not be mad about it. 
 Of course, I’m being a bit naive here and in reality, I will be living off Aldi quality stuff rather than Waitrose level shit for a while longer. The number of graduates that worked tirelessly until 4am the night before a deadline, to then not actually get a job is slightly worrying. I actually wanted to be a speech therapist last year, but quickly ditched that idea, partly due to the need for further education after my degree (which was a no from me), and partly down to me rediscovering my passion for writing shite blogs like this about my life problems. 
 I’ve always viewed creative writing as ‘just a hobby’, but surely, if you can make your hobby your job, you should do exactly that? I want to love my job in the future, so I can come home and twerk on my husband with a smile on my face, rather than trudge home and be the grumpy slob that I currently am. I don’t want to be a Karen that: 
 
 Attends couples therapy 
 Has to use a dildo 
 Drives a Honda Jazz (sorry not sorry) 
 Watches Eastenders as part of a ‘perfect night in’ 
 
 I want to be a GEORGINA that has bomb ass nails, only a small double chin, an actual fun job where they always have cake in the office, a kid that swims competitively for England or something and a husband that cooks like Jamie Oliver.

 Hello. I am a bored university student with way too much time to waste. In order to have something to whack onto my CV, I write for the uni newspaper. The articles have to be written in a formal manner, so this is my platform to rewrite my articles with the correct amount of sass that they originally deserved.   View more posts
