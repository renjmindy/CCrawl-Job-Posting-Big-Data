 Job opportunity - EU institutions 
 Posted in  News  by  WordstoDeeds 
 The European Personnel Selection Office is looking for talented, motivated translators from across Europe to work for the EU Institutions in the following languages: German, Greek, Spanish or Swedish. 
 Here is an extract from the job presentation (also available in German and French). 
 A multilingual organisation like the EU needs high quality translation and relies on professional linguists to keep it running smoothly. The role of the language services in the various EU institutions and bodies is to support and strengthen multilingual communication in Europe and to help Europeans understand EU policies. 
 You will be working in a challenging, multi-cultural environment, playing an essential role in the development of policy and legislation which has a positive effect on the lives of 505 million people. 
 Our selection procedures for translators are intended for candidates who have a perfect command, both written and spoken, of the language of the selection procedure (mother tongue or equivalent knowledge), backed by a thorough knowledge of at least two other EU languages, one of which is English, French or German. If you are not up to this standard, we would strongly advise you not to apply. 
 You should combine a university degree-level with a very self-motivated approach and the drive and determination to make a major contribution. Although professional experience is not required previous experience as a translator would be beneficial.

 Deadline for applications:  5 August 2014, 12.00 (Brussels time)
