 Are you looking to work for a dynamic 3rd party logistics service provider? 
 My client is looking for an individual to join their team onsite as a Key Account Manager working strategically with their existing customer base. The role will involve dealing with clients daily either customer facing or online ensuring the highest levels of customer service are maintained. The salary for the role will be c£45,000. 
 I am looking for a Key Account Manager to join a prominent 3rd party distribution specialist who have been performing to an exceptional level recently with distribution figures at a higher level than their traditional Christmas peak. This has all been achieved despite the current financial pitfalls other companies are facing, due to this they have renegotiated contract extensions with multiple clients and with new contract wins also in the offing it means that the future has never looked brighter! 
 You will report to the Commercial Manager onsite and you will have his full support and backing as you implement plans for future expansion. As a business they are committed to developing their workforce, striving to meet the highest levels of excellence in a demanding environment. 
 The main function for the Key Account Manager is to develop, build and maintain long term profitable business partnerships with an existing customer. You will work closely with your client portfolio to forecast and track key account metrics to deliver the best level of service possible. 
 As the Key Account Manager, you will be responsible for nurturing existing customer accounts and offering logistics solutions as and when required. You will ensure a high level of customer satisfaction at all times and contribute to on-boarding new business in line with set targets. My client's distribution base includes a range of clients covering e-commerce, technology and leading FMCG brands. A candidate who can demonstrate previous success from account management within these sectors would be preferable. 
 As the Key Account Manager, you will have experience of working within a well-structured sales environment. You will be a proficient user of Windows based programmes Excel and Word and have experience of fully integrated system-based sales order processing. You will have strong sales and customer relationship development skills with the ability to negotiate at multiple levels with customer and supplier organisations. 
 The Key Account Manager role is based at my client's site in Minworth on the outskirts of Birmingham and is a Full-time position, the successful candidate will receive a salary of c£45,000 with additional benefits.
