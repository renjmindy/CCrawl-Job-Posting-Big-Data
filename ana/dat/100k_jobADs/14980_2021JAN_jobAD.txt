  Company isn't Hiring, Can I Create My Own Job?  
 Work It Daily 
 July 15, 2009 
 Dear Experts, I interned at a company this past spring and really enjoyed my experience there. I'd love to work full-time but their are currently no job openings. I'm still volunteering on a part-time basis there so I can stay involved in case anything opens up but I think it may take till summer's end for that to happen. I can't wait that long! How do you think my manager would react if I approached her about hiring me for a position or role I created? Basically, what if I made up my own job? A job that would suit me perfectly and be a benefit to the company. Would they laugh in my face? What approach would I take?  Here is how our T.A.P. experts answered this question:   Q#204  Agree w/othrs: bld biz case 4 creating new job, mktg plan 2 sell it; cd start PT, grow 2 FT if $ issue. ( @juliaerickson )  Q#204  I like the idea & initiative, but understand that the company finances will play a huge role in your plan's viability. ( @gradversity )  Q#204  You're basically selling your services 2 them. Make a good enough case, and they'll buy. Solve a problem! ( @beneubanks )  Q#204  Make sure new job is needed/wanted-provide boss w/list of results you can deliver. ( @teenarose )  Q#204  Create a job description 4 yourself & present a business case for how the role would benefit the company. Great idea! ( @DebraWheatman )  Q#204  ABSOLUTELY pitch job idea. Won't get laughed at. May not get hired now, but they'll keep you in mind! ( @jtodonnell )  Q#204  Try it. Won't seem strange & you may get what you want. They may say no but won't laugh at you. Good luck! ( @askamanager )  Our Twitter Advice Project (T.A.P.) is no longer an active campaign.
