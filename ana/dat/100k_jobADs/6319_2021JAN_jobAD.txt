  3 Career Mistakes To Avoid At All Costs  
 J.T. O'Donnell 
 June 11, 2012 
 Okay, so the economy can’t make up its mind.  Unemployment  goes down... and then up. The financial market goes up... and then down. Facebook’s stock starts high... and ends low. Anybody starting to feel sick from the rollercoaster ride our economic recovery is on? I am! Now, during times like these, I realize the LAST thing you want to hear is you could be making mistakes that could hurt your  career . But alas, uncertain times cause errors in judgement. 
 
 Career Mistakes To Avoid At All Costs 
 Here are three things I’m telling all my CareerHMO members these days:  Mistake 1 - Staying in a job you hate.  Not bothering to look for a new, better job when you hate the one you are in is a recipe for disaster. Here’s why... While you think you are a pro at hiding your distaste for your _________ (insert manager, co-worker, project, client, etc.), the reality is people can tell. And, should your company decide it needs to do some "restructuring" to increase profits and stability, the first people they look to let go are the ones that don’t seem to really want to be there. Trust me, you are not an academy award-winning actor. Otherwise, you’d be in Hollywood right now and not in a job you hate! Moreover, when we aren’t engaged in our jobs we make mistakes - and even the little ones add up. So, if you are unhappy, make a plan and commit to getting out. And don’t stop looking until you find the right thing. Make a move now, or risk having the move made for you.  Mistake #2 - Thinking you are too busy to develop a personal brand.  I’m amazed at how many people aren’t taking the concept of personal branding seriously. Trust me when I say there are no “employees” any more. We are all "businesses of one" - and that means we need to build strong brands. I especially cringe when someone who is currently working says, “I don’t need to do that stuff because I have a job.” You don’t have a job - you have one client, and that client could drop you tomorrow. Then how will you pay the bills?  Personal branding  is something we all need to do, regardless of our career situation. It’s not who you know... it’s who knows YOU. Ask anyone who has been out of work for six months or more and they’ll tell you how important it is to have a strong personal brand. Personal branding takes time. So, while I’m not suggesting you spend five hours a day on it, I do suggest you build and commit to a scheduled plan for growing your brand. Companies that do great marketing stay in business. People who do great personal branding stay employed!  Mistake #3 - Not being on Google+.  I realize you are saying, “Is she kidding? I’m already on Facebook, Linkedin, and Twitter - and I barely use those. What do I need another platform for?” Well, here’s the thing: Google+ isn’t just another platform, it’s the solution to your social networking challenges. It’s easier to understand than Twitter, has better follower interaction than LinkedIn, and is visually more appealing than Facebook. Plus, being an early-adopter of technology like this will earn you respect and trust from those around you. Any time we are on the "tip of the curl" of a technology, we show others how smart we are. Google+ is going to make you look good. In fact, I’m so passionate about Google+ I created a FREE video tutorial and e-guide for all our readers called, “5 Steps to Becoming a Google+ Powerhouse.” Trust me, invest a little time in building your Google+ profile and you’ll be thanking me later! We can’t rest on our career laurels any more. Staying on top of trends and new expectations is the only way to ensure we will be able to stay employable. I hope you will take heed and make sure you aren’t making any of the mistakes above. It’s better to be safe than sorry!
