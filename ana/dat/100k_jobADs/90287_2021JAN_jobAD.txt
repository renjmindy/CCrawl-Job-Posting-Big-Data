Your key focus will be delivering highly reliable and scalable applications in a fast-paced environment. You will be working in close contact with experienced engineers in the team and across the Bloomberg organization. The team operates in an agile manner where everyone is expected to contribute ideas in an open discussion to achieve the team's time-to-market objectives. Our culture puts an emphasis on applying industry standard practices and tools to bear on the challenges we face, and we embrace open source technologies wherever appropriate.
