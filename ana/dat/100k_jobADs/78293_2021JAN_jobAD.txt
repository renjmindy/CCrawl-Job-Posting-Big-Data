  2013: Best Outlook In Years For Those Changing Careers  
 Lisa Sperow 
 December 21, 2012 
 Good news for those interested in  changing careers  in 2013, according to the article, “ Jobs: Getting Ahead in 2013 ” in CNN Money. “If you’re eager to land a new job, win a promotion, or snag a decent raise, next year will be your best chance since 2007 to get ahead – especially for professional workers,” says the article. Further, if you’re looking for a job in accounting, finance, legal, advertising, marketing, or technology, you can look forward to a pay increase, as salaries in these fields are expected to grow 3.7% in 2013, according to  Robert Half International’s 2013 Salary Guide . What’s more, CareerBuilder has identified a list of occupations that are on an upward trajectory regarding employment. The list includes accountants, computer systems analysts, and event coordinators. Okay, so... yay. It’s a better outlook for jobs than we’ve seen in the last few years, but… what does this mean for you? Sounds like if you’re an accountant, you’ve got it made! But what if you’re not an accountant? Or… what if you are, and you’ve grown to hate accounting? What if you’re already employed in one of the supposed “hot” fields, and you’re miserable? Will a pay increase of 3.7% make it all better? Forget about employment trends for a minute. If you’re unhappy with your career and want to make a change, you’ll need to look inward first. 
 
 Getting Ahead In 2013 For Those Changing Careers: Where To Start 
 It  is  fantastic news that the employment outlook overall is positive for the coming year. If you’re ready for a career change, then 2013  can  be your year to get ahead. You just need to know where to start. So that you can avoid moving from one ill-fitting career to another, the place to start is  not  with the latest “Hot Jobs” lists, but with a thorough self-evaluation. Instead of starting with job boards and trying to match yourself to any number of positions posted, let’s create your ideal job from scratch first. We’re going to take a look at YOU and what you have to offer first.  Skills & Abilities : What do you do really well? What do you enjoy doing? Write down your strength areas. Don’t be shy! And no editing – there are no “stupid” answers here. Include the things that truly bring you joy and that you are naturally skilled in. And lose the resume-speak. Since your current job is not a fit for you, don’t bother writing down things that you can do with competence but don’t enjoy. Going back to the accountant example, if you’ve had it up to your eyeballs with creating balance sheets and ledgers, then leave them off your list. Make the list as exhaustive as possible, and don’t sell yourself short.  Personality  : We are who we are. And the more we can be our authentic, true selves, the happier (and, ultimately, more productive) we will be. We perform best in environments and positions that are in our comfort zones. Do you prefer to work alone or with lots of people? Do you like routine and predictability, or would you rather have each day be its own adventure? How independent are you? What kind of environment would you be most comfortable in?  Passions and Interests  : Let’s think about the end game for a minute:  Why  do you do what you do? We’re dismissing “to get a paycheck” as an answer here, because (presumably) you've already got one of those, and you know that there’s got to be an answer  beyond  that one. What  really  gets you excited? What kind of organization would you  love  to work for? How could you put your talents to use in ways that would be fulfilling and satisfying – beyond the paycheck? We've all got areas that interest us more than others – fashion, electronics, education, politics, animals, children, ministry, music - the list goes on. Almost any industry can use almost any skill set. Which one would you like to offer yours to? 
 Your Career Outlook 
 If you’re going to make a career change, take the time to do it right. Chances are that the quickie fix of job hopping to another company in the same type of position or industry isn’t going to provide the lasting satisfaction that you seek. Take the time to analyze your own skills, personality, and passions, and create the outline for your dream job - customized just to you. You should be able to state, very specifically, the kind of work that you’re looking for and what type of environment/industry/organization you’re targeting. Once you’ve got this figured out – tell everyone you know! Network like crazy! Go for it with gusto! 2013  can  be the year you get ahead with your career. And if you’re thinking of becoming an accountant... you’re in luck! Photo Credit:  Shutterstock
