 List of Non Phone Work at Home Jobs 
 Published by  aw1219  on May 20, 2016May 20, 2016 
 We may earn money or products from some of the companies mentioned in this post. 
 So you want to work from home but you only want a non-phone work at home job. For many, this may be their only option because they have a lot of distractions in their home or noise in the background. Still others may simply prefer to engage in work outside of the customer service realm. If this is your case, to talk to customers over the telephone. There are many reasons why people want to do this and if this is the case for you also please be assured that you can still work from home because there are several jobs, gigs, and tasks that you can do to earn extra income online. 
 You may be surprised to know that there are a lot of non phone work at home jobs because of the growth of the Internet and more and more people having access to it. Especially would this be the case if the company has a lot of virtual needs. It is much more cost effective and easier to hire telecommuters to complete their work for them. Some of the jobs could be in writing, transcription, participating in online juries, data entry, chatting, and so many more things. I have included a list of legitimate work at home jobs, tasks, assignments, and more that you can do on a full time basis, part time, or in your spare time. 
 Here is a list of legitimate non phone work at home jobs that you can sign up with online to start making some extra cash.
