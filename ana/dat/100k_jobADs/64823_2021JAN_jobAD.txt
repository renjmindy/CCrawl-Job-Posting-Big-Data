 About us 
 You are 6x more likely to die from a fire if you live in a house share and we think that is outright wrong. We're on a mission to help landlords create and maintain the safest accommodation for tenants across the UK. Yuno is breathing fresh air into the way the property industry manages licensing and compliance. We've just launched our MVP in London and after great demand from our partners, are planning a national rollout early 2021. We're an early stage startup with buckets of potential offering huge opportunities to learn and grow with the company. 
 **The role  ** 
 You'll be our first Account Manager hire so there is huge potential to grow and take on more roles and responsibilities. Initially, here's what you can expect to be working on day to day: 
 
 Liaising with clients from point of instruction through to application submission 
 Communicating over email, phone and SMS with clients, contractors and partners 
 Managing our internal processes, ensuring all runs smoothly 
 Coordinating with our contractors to ensure home visits are professional and certificates produced promptly 
 Anything and everything that helps Yuno to grow! 
 
 What you 'll need 
 We're looking for a superstar who's detail focused and customer orientated with some or all of these qualities: 
 
 Outstanding attention to detail - laser focussed on grammar, spelling and formatting 
 Excellent telephone manner - comfortable dealing with and adapting to client's needs 
 An eye for improvement - willing to test new processes for continuous improvement 
 A positive attitude - willing to throw themselves into any situation and learn 
 
 If some or all of the above sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you! 
 Compensation & benefits 
 
 £18,000 - £23,000 dependant on experience 
 Equity stake in the business 
 20 holidays + 8 bank holidays 
 Day off on your birthday 
 
 Location 
 
 Remote, UK. 
 We have a lovely office in a co-working space in London but regularly work remotely so this position can be based anywhere in the UK!
