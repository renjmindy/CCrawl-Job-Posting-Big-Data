 Hello Readers, 
 I thought this might be of interest to those who are looking for a job in Ireland, and want to find out more where the new jobs are being created. The majority of job announcements are covered in the press, but it may then be challenging to find out where those new companies are located and where you can apply for the jobs. 
 I came across the below list on the  Jobseeker app from Intreo . In the app is a section of job announcements, which you can find on the  The Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed  website. Do check out their website, it has a number of resources for people who are unemployed, and sign up to  their E-Bulletin  to get updates. 
 As so many Irish people are returning home for Christmas, I am sure it will be topic of conversation topic over the Christmas table. For those who are thinking of moving back, or wanting to move to Ireland, the below list gives you an idea of the job creation efforts around Ireland. I have just pasted in December and November. To find out prior to October 2015, click  here . It's great to see all the announcements in once place! 
 Click on any of the links, and you'll find out where the company is located, the type of jobs available and where to apply.
