 Touchy Feely Takeaways 
 Posted on  July 7, 2015  |  Leave a comment 
 As I come to the end of my time at the Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB), I have begun to reflect on what I will take away from my experience. The Stanford MBA program is renowned for many unique classes. At the top of this list is one called OB374:  Interpersonal Dynamics ,  which is fondly known as  ‘Touchy Feely’ (TF), so I’ll start there.

 An experiment

 Recruitment of new staff can be a costly exercise. 
 In emerging industries built of fledgling businesses, networks are at core of how positions are filled. 
 Recently a local company contacted me asking if there was anyone in my network suitable to fill a biochemistry role? 
 Not knowing anyone who was actively looking for a new job (especially considering that many people these days are passive job seekers) I decided to post it on my facebook and see what response I would get. Three candidates in less than 3 hours. Not bad. 
 From these three I put forward and recommended one to the company. Following an interview they ended up hiring that person. Success for social media. 
 
 In recruitment social media is still an untapped resource in NZ whether it be Facebook, Twitter, blogging or Linkedin. 
 Given the current state of the job market, job seekers need to be at the top of their game. This goes beyond adding notches to the CV to being savvy, multifaceted and proactive about how you go after securing that new position. Use every tool at your disposal. 
 From the point of recruiters/ employers the early adoption of these new technologies has mainly been used for background checking purposes as opposed to direct marketing for openings. This is despite immediate benefits for such tasks as filling short term work contracts, filling positions for small enterprises or for aiding the initial ‘casting of the net’ for applicants.
