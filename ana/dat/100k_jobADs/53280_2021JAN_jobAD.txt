 They say that good help is hard to find. And while that is very true, it is even truer that good help is hard to keep. It becomes even more true when it is referring to startups. And that is just one of the  challenges startups have to face . By its very nature, a startup is an unproven venture. Quality help will want certain assurances such as: 
 
 There will be ongoing work tomorrow, and into the future 
 They will be paid adequately, and on time 
 There is room to grow with the company 
 
 Startups can’t really promise any of that. They are surviving on venture capitol, one round at a time. If you are going to convince a top engineer working for one of the major tech companies to jump ship and work for you, there are some things you will need to have in your favor. 
 You will need a big idea that feels like an inevitable sure thing. Or, you will need an important idea that makes other jobs seem trivial by comparison. And even with those things, you are going to need a heck of a sales pitch that allows your prospective employee to catch the vision you have for the future.

 The medical field is one of the most sought after career paths in the world. If you think about the job most associated with helping other people, a physician will likely be the first thing that comes to mind. Becoming a doctor is one of the noblest things a person can do with their lives. 
 It is also one of the better-paying jobs you can do regardless of where in the world you happen to live. While it is true that some lineman whose name you don’t know, on a losing NFL team, with a mediocre career likely makes more than the average doctor, that player’s career will be short and brutish. And at the end of it, he will need to spend what money he has saved on seeing a good doctor. 
 Not only is being a doctor a noble job and one of the highest paying jobs, it is also one of the most respected jobs. There is much esteem associated with saving lives. That said, there are many people who would love to contribute to that cause, but who have an aversion to close contact with, well, people. The good news is that there are many ways to contribute to the healing arts without becoming a doctor. Here are 5. 
 1. Pharmacist 
 You probably felt like a pharmacist the first time you used one of those online  pill identifier  tools to help a loved one figure out what those pills were. You know, the ones in the bottle with the worn out label. It is the feeling you get when you help someone sort out a medical issue without the 12 years of school. 
 That feeling might lead you to pursue formal  pharmacy career training . The average annual salary for a pharmacist is over $112,000.  Click Here to Read Article …

 While everyone understands that work is what brings the money in, some people have a hard time staying motivated during a long eight to ten-hour day at the office. Everyone has their days where they are  extremely motivated  and get a ton done and then there are the days when you just feel blah and won’t to do nothing but hit the door at 5 pm. If you are finding yourself having many more blah days than days where you are extremely motivated, this article is for you. With that in mind, read on below for a few of the top tips to help you stay motivated when you’re at the office. 
 Grab a Quick Cup of Joe 
 There is nothing better than  office coffee machines  to keep you motivated. If your office has one, then take a quick break when you start to feel like you are lagging behind, and grab a quick cup of Joe. You would be surprised at how much of a pick-me-up a cup of coffee can be in the middle of a shift.

 After coming up with a good business idea and launching a business, the biggest challenge a new business faces is getting enough leads. This can be overcome by learning about effective marketing. However, even after a company has created a successful marketing campaign, the business will not prosper unless the sales team can convert those leads into sales. 
 Let’s face it, selling is difficult. Human beings are complicated and persuading someone to part with their money is often difficult in an economy where the cost of living is constantly rising. You have to convince them that your product or service is of more value than the money they hold in their hands. 
 With that in mind, let’s take a look at some ways a company can optimize their sales process to convert more leads into sales after marketing has done most of the heavy lifting.

 Today’s startups are exceedingly scattered operations. Instead of a centralized work environment such as an office, managers and employees are functioning remotely, using the web as a means to share and communicate. In many cases it’s ideal way to begin a business, as the talent pool is greatly expanded, payroll reduced, and the overhead associated with “brick and mortar” practically eliminated. 
 The academic world has been slow to catch up with this change, leaving many business majors unsure of how to go about leading a scattered workforce. While all situations are different and therefore require an individually crafted approach, the following suggestions for efficiently managing remote workers are sure to come in handy in all cases: 
 Utilize multipurpose management software 
 It’s hard enough for business leaders to keep track of operations in an office where everything is under their watchful eye, let alone when workers are across the map. There’s no shame in depending on comprehensive, multipurpose management software to get the job done. Some, such as  Asure Software , include a human capital management platform. This gives business leaders access to detailed data about employee productivity.  Click Here to Read Article …

 Have you ever had to manage conflict at a job? When I was eighteen and fresh out of high school, I was offered my  first job  in which interacting with coworkers was a requirement. 
 I didn’t have much of anything to compare the experience to, but I sensed early on that there was some serious conflict brewing between the ladies I worked with. There was constant talking behind each other’s backs and harsh criticism was commonplace. Those who weren’t passive aggressive were just downright nasty. 
 But being the youngest in the bunch, I didn’t think it was my place to speak up and I feared that certain individuals would turn on me if I simply excused myself from the conflict.  Click Here to Read Article …
