 Do you have specialist experience in the implementation and roll out of ERP systems within a manufacturing or engineering based environment? Can you support a site wide roll out and group level integration of an ERP system into this type of environment and assist with its integration into current manufacturing, finance and logistics systems and support the training and understanding of the workforce in regards to the new system? 
 This engineering and manufacturing site is a key facility within the EMEA region of what is a global business and they have just undertaken the implementation of a their new PLEX ERP system across the whole facility and now require the support of an experienced ERP Support Analyst who can help them to deliver the required level of support, understanding and training for the business and its workforce. 
 You will help to create and document the correct new processes and SOP's and will be the key point of contact for all queries and issues raised across the facility. The ability to look at the whole site and the system from a mindset of continuous improvement will be essential and a previous background in some form of manufacturing and / or engineering type environment will be key. Previous experience within an ERP / MRP implementation and roll out based position will be crucial and any exposure to the PLEX system will be highly advantageous but not essential. 
 If you would like to discuss this opportunity in more detail or to apply, please get in contact with Matt Harris for more information.
