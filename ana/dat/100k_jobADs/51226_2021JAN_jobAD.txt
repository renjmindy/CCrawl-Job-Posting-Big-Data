 MA Jobs & Workforce Summit Recap: This Year, We Mean Business! 
 In case you missed it, the  Workforce Solutions Group (WSG) , with support and in partnership with  SkillWorks , successfully hosted the  7th Annual Massachusetts Jobs and Workforce Summit  on Wednesday, October 26 in Devens, MA. Every year, the Workforce Solutions group brings more than 300 key policy makers, business, labor, and education leaders, to present the latest information about statewide labor and credential needs, higher education initiatives and career pathways for young adults. This year’s theme?  We Mean Business! 
 The WSG is a statewide coalition of business, labor, workforce and community groups  (including SkillWorks!)  working to improve talent pipelines in the Commonwealth. Our work is focused on developing and building capacity in accessible pathways to education and employment for all MA residents, so naturally, we ALWAYS mean business! 
 This year we really wanted to underscore  BUSINESS  and employers as key partners in our work and advocacy around improving talent pipelines so business have the workforce they need and residents have access to quality jobs and career pathways to thrive. 
 This year's Summit featured keynote speakers including Governor Charlie Baker, Congressman Seth Moulton, and Secretary Ronald Walker II, dynamic plenary sessions including business leaders, the  new pay equity law in MA  and youth leadership and policy advocacy today, and of course, the  coveted  Workforce Champion awards! 
 In our featured Business Leader Panel:  Building High Road Partnership and Quality Jobs  ,  Nancy Snyder, President of  Commonwealth Corporation , moderated a valuable discussion between panelists Joseph Quinn, Sr. Director at  Walmart , Rachel Kaprielian, SVP at  Vertex  Pharmaceuticals, and Dane Linn, VP of the  National Business Roundtable  – each of whom have expertise working with educational institutions, employers, and workforce development professional to develop and implement high value partnerships across a wide variety of industry sectors. From  inspiring students in STEM  education to creating  career paths for veterans  to working with students in vocational schools to impacting  national education and workforce development policy , it was the type of constructive conversation that was immediately applicable to the workforce, education, and labor leaders, practitioners, and advocates in the room. Each business leader also emphasized the importance and necessity of creating these partnerships to generate and sustain talent pipelines for employers, with access and opportunity for all Massachusetts residents. 
 Thanks to this and other conversations, attendees at the Summit were brimming with excitement, enthusiasm, and readiness to take ideas and learnings from the day back to their own communities to continue working to enact change.

 Increase accountability measures  by adopting common performance measures for job training, education and employment programs and implement wage record matching for all programs. 
 Expand successful career and vocational technical pathways  for high school students and disconnected youth. 
 Increase interagency coordination  to leverage and maximize existing resources such as the federal SNAP to Skills program and work study programs.
