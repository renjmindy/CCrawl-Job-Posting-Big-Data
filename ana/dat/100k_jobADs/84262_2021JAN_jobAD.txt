 4 Quick and Easy Ways to Ace the BCC Premium Demo Lesson 
 Sep  29 
 Hi fellow-RJ tutors! I am writing this in my attempt to find potential tutors to join the BCC (Business Conversation Curriculum) Premium Tutor Pool of RareJob. I also would like to help the aspiring Premium Tutors to set their apprehensions aside and pass the demo lesson successfully. 
 EXPECTATIONS FROM BCC PREMIUM TUTORS: 
 You must have seen the  ad about the program of RareJob  about Premium Lessons. 
 You must have internalized by now that, as a BCC Premium Tutor, you are expected to: 
 
 
 Use the appropriate material and adhere to studentâ€™s request 
 Use video camera in all premium lessons 
 Ensure good sound quality all throughout the premium lesson 
 Wear smart casual clothes in all premium lessons 
 Conduct lessons in an appropriate teaching environment (i.e. no unnecessary sounds, items or people on the background) 
 
 
 That's according to RareJob. 
 Now, you might be interested to join the said program but haply, dreading the demo lesson. 
 As I have mentioned, I am writing this to help you calm your ponies. I myself had millions of butterflies in my tummy (lol!) during the mock lesson and the coaching session but **the key to acing both is preparation. 
** 
Here are the four (4) quick and easy ways to ace your upcoming BCC Premium demo class: 
 1.  FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH THE LESSON FLOW. 
As you may have observed, Jissen materials are different from RJ4B materials so  read the material sent by the business team thoroughly.  Needless to say, make sure that you also follow the guidelines. 
 2.  PREPARE THIS TEMPLATE ON YOUR NOTEPAD. 
 
 "OVERALL SCORE 
 Vocabulary/Phrases 
 Grammar 
 Pronunciation " 
 
 Make sure that you copy-paste all your corrections to your notepad every time you give your corrections.  Doing this will ensure that you are ready to send an accomplished feedback note to the student towards the end of your lesson. 
 IMPORTANT NOTE:  Send the accomplished notes before starting to tell your feedback about your student's performance during the lesson. 
 FAQ: 
How do we know the scoring system? They are written at the end of the material. Go, figure it out. ðŸ™‚ 
 3.  BE PROFESSIONAL. 
 While you can be very friendly in your regular lessons, you are expected to be professional when teaching business conversation students. Smiling with your eyes during your classes with business students should be enough according to our very helpful  Tutor Nikki.B  to make your students feel that you are listening to them. By the way, she has also answered a few FAQs of some aspiring premium tutors. Please pay her blog a visit  here. 
 4. **GIVE YOUR BEST AND TRUST IN THE LORD. 
** 
 Be prepared before the lesson. Be attentive during the lesson. Be responsible after the lesson (i.e. accomplish your notes). Most of all, remember this verse: 
 
 Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established. Proverbs 16:3 
 
 That's all! Ganbatte! ðŸ˜€ 
 After reading these tips, I hope you will sincerely consider joining the program. Please send me the following if you want me to refer you. Please trust that I will keep your information private. Of course, I need to send your info to the business team so they can contact you. ðŸ™‚

 5 Reasons You Should Join RareJob 
 Jul  15 
 HOW I FOUND RAREJOB 
 Finding RareJob Company was a blessing in disguise. 
 I found RareJob's advertisement when I was originally searching for a job for my sister online. It was just in time when I also started considering helping my husband in our financial needs in the ministry and helping my mother in the Philippines as well! That was in August 2013. 
 Reading through the qualifications on the advertisement, I thought to myself. "Maybe I should give it a try."  After much prayers, God helped me to pass the screening, demo lesson and the interview! 
 So I started working at home ever since then and I thought this job is, indeed, a rare find! 
 So why should you consider joining  RareJob Philippines? Here you go! You will: 
 1. HAVE FULL CONTROL OF YOUR TIME. 
 You can teach anytime during the day from  5AM to 12MN.  You can choose to teach for 19 hours or just 30 minutes each day. You can also decide to teach every single day of the month, once a week, once every two weeks, once a month or not at all. ðŸ™‚ ** The bottom line is  ** _  you are your own boss. _   ðŸ™‚ 
 Have a look on how flexible your schedule can be. 
 Here, you can see that I decided to teach for four hours on one day, one hour on another day and I did not teach on the 13th of July. It's extremely flexible, isn't it? 
 2.  BE ABLE TO HELP YOUR FAMILY FINANCIALLY WITHOUT WORKING LIKE A HORSE. 
 The company offers substantial incentives for: 
 
 perfect attendance in a month (i.e. having less than 2.5% class cancellation rate due to blackout, connection problem and so on.) 
 video lessons for at least 100 classes each month (i.e. 50 hours/month) 
 excellent teaching which is based on the students' evaluation. The awardees receive incentives in the quarter they qualified as  "Good Tutors" . 
 converting applicants like your friends and others to become tutors. 
 being a recommended TOEFL coach/tutor. 
 passing general tutoring skills evaluations. 
 being a  Premium Lesson Tutor. 
 teaching on peak hours or holidays. 
 
 Therefore, you can imagine that  you can earn EXTRA without sacrificing your time for your family and your other priorities. 
 So if you're a mother like me, you'll get a happier baby! ðŸ™‚ 
 Sweet, isn't she? 
 3. LEARN FROM YOUR POLITE AND PROFESSIONAL STUDENTS. 
 Most of the students are Japanese. There are also instances when Brazilians, Russians, Koreans, Chinese, Taiwanese, and other nationalities residing in Japan, take online lessons from RareJob. 
 Needless to say,  students are from different walks of life . I have experienced teaching children to read simple children's stories in English, having free conversation with stay-at-home moms like me, teaching grammar to elementary and high school students, helping university students pass TOEFL/IELTS exams or job interviews, teaching Business English to career people in and out of Japan.  It is noteworthy that 99.9% of the students are very polite and receptive during their booked lessons. 
 4. HAVE A CHANCE TO LEARN JAPANESE CULTURE AND HAVE VIRTUAL TOURS AT THE COMFORT OF YOUR HOME. 
 I have personally grown a lot in my knowledge of Japanese culture. Before teaching Japanese, I only knew very general information about Japan.  Gradually, talking with my students helped me grow not only in my skills in teaching, but also in understanding festivals, food, and faith of Japanese people. 
 Some of my business students even take me to virtual tours to Japanese prefectures or cities abroad while taking online classes. 
 Look forward to having a virtual tour if you join RareJob! ðŸ™‚ 
 5. HAVE ANOTHER SOURCE OF INCOME, IN CASE YOU HAVE A FULL-TIME JOB. 
 I have heard that there are RareJob tutors who are lawyers, doctors, teachers, office staff, university students and so on.  If you happen to be doing the ministry or pursuing another career, you can still consider joining. Use your free time to earn extra for your emergency needs! ðŸ™‚ 
 Why don't you give it a try? ðŸ™‚ 
 This is it! The job you have been waiting for-it's up to you if you wanna do it full-time or part-time! ðŸ™‚ 
 APPLICATION PROCESS 
 Soâ€¦.after sharing with you the five (5) reasons why you should join RareJob, I am hoping and praying that you have decided to be in at this point. 
 Here's a quick tutorial on how you can get started:
