 "‚Ä¶government does not create jobs" 
 Posted on  September 15, 2011  by   Seth 
 I would prefer it if more politicians sounded like Herman Cain. Here is a great paragraph that he wrote in  today's  Wall Street Journal : 
 
 As a longtime leader in the business community, I know firsthand that government does not create jobs. It can only create the conditions in which businesses operate. These conditions can spur growth, or they can suppress it. The conditions imposed by the current administration have suppressed growth. 
 
 I've heard Cain derided by both left and right as a simple "pizza maker". Yet, I've heard very few politicians who understood this truth.

 Well, to be a nit-picker, govt. can create union jobs, of course at great expense to the rest of us. üòâ

 I believe that falls under this part of Cain's comment: "‚Ä¶or they can suppress it."

 If he only made one pizza chain, one pizza store, one pizza, it would still be one more than the great job creator currently in the Whitehouse.
