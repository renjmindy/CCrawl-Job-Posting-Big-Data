 Job 20 
 1 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 
 2 Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste. 
 3 I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer. 
 4 Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth, 
 5 That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment? 
 6 Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds; 
 7 Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he? 
 8 He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night. 
 9 The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him. 
 10 His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods. 
 11 His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust. 
 12 Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue; 
 13 Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth: 
 14 Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him. 
 15 He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly. 
 16 He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him. 
 17 He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter. 
 18 That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein. 
 19 Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not; 
 20 Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired. 
 21 There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods. 
 22 In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him. 
 23 When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating. 
 24 He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through. 
 25 It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him. 
 26 All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle. 
 27 The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him. 
 28 The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath. 
 29 This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.

 Wow, Zophar goes at it again…..nothing like your so called friends to point out every little detail that your supposedly doing wrong! In reading this, we would think "I would never do such a thing"; but, we must be very careful before we speak. 
 James 4:11-12 AMP says "Believers, do not speak against or slander one another. He who speaks [self-righteously] against a brother or [a]judges his brother [hypocritically], speaks against the Law and judges the Law. If you judge the Law, you are not a doer of the Law but a judge of it. There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the One who is able to save and to destroy [the one God who has the absolute power of life and death]; but who are you to [hypocritically or self-righteously] pass judgment on your neighbor?"

 We need to be careful not to be quick to say God is telling us to say something. Often times it can just as easily be our own subjective opinion. And we think that it adds power by saying that it's God when you God may have no part in it and it's our own strong emotion that urges us. It's important to be sensitive to the spirit of God and speak whenever he says speak but we need to be mindful to keep ourselves and check that it's not just our flash trying to sound spiritual.

 Psalm 73: 
2. But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped. 
 3. For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. 
 17. Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end. 
 18.Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction. 
 22. So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.

 Job 20 
Again Job’s friend approached him. Again not with words of encouragement but speaking to him as if he had done something wrong…….help us Lord to encourage. Zophar gives a great picture of what will happen to the wicked but could he not have used words to encourage Job and not beat him down more…..yes the wicked will be judged yes Job probably had reversed everything over and over in his mind . 
 Zophar may have needed to examine his own heart. 
This why we are the saints and not the pastor. You could say something that could destroy someone not knowing the inside story. We cannot be quick to judge and swift to tell it lest it wounds the already wounded. In Jesus name. Lord set a guard over my lips . In Jesus name. 
 Proverbs 6:12-16 ESV 
A worthless person, a wicked man, goes about with crooked speech, winks with his eyes, signals with his feet, points with his finger, with perverted heart devises evil, continually sowing discord; therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in a moment he will be broken beyond healing. There are six things that the Lord hates, seven that are an abomination to him: 
 haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood 
a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are quick to rush into evil, 
a false witness who pours out lies and a person who stirs up conflict in the community. 
 My son, keep your father's command and do not forsake your mother's teaching. 
 Bind them always on your heart; fasten them around your neck.

 a quote I found 
“If you can’t be the pencil to write someone’s happiness be the eraser to erase their sadness “. Prayer is the key.., 
 Humility in His presence submission to Him repenting and relinquish all to him. He is the true joy giver. 
Oh such love when we bow in prayer 
and bring friends family and enemies before the throne of God. He is the source of strength ……His eraser big…

 “All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.” 
‭‭Job‬ ‭20:26‬ ‭KJV‬‬ 
 Don’t let your fire go out. 
To expose those secret things we must put some light on the situation. 
The Holy Ghost or the Word is the light that guides us. I wanna make sure my light doesn’t go out and I wanna make sure my light is bright so it’s back to the altar because the light on the Alastair never went out so if I don’t want my light to go out I’m going back to the altar that when dark sneaky things try to come my way I’ll be able to surface them quickly or catch myself and say woah now Jackson is this Christlike. I wanna make sure my spirit is right especially in this time and this hour.

 This is the reward that God gives the wicked. It is the inheritance decreed by God.” 
Job 20:29 NLT 
 Knowing the truth, we also know the end. Reading a chapter like this reminds me of the song "Help Me" by Bro. Cort Chavis. There are souls living this destructive lifestyle, who are headed to a dark end. How fitting for a service like last night's - Lord revive our passion for the lost!

 I’ve had to endure your insults, but now my spirit prompts me to reply. “Don’t you realize that from the beginning of time, ever since people were first placed on the earth, the triumph of the wicked has been short lived and the joy of the godless has been only temporary? Their children will beg from the poor, for they must give back their stolen riches. They will vomit the wealth they swallowed. God won’t let them keep it down. They will give back everything they worked for. Their wealth will bring them no joy. For they oppressed the poor and left them destitute. They foreclosed on their homes. The heavens will reveal their guilt, and the earth will testify against them. A flood will sweep away their house. God’s anger will descend on them in torrents. This is the reward that God gives the wicked. It is the inheritance decreed by God.” 
Job 20:3‭-‬5‭, ‬10‭, ‬15‭-‬15‭, ‬18‭-‬19‭, ‬27‭-‬29 NLT 
 https://bible.com/bible/116/job.20.3-29.NLT 
 What's sad about this is that Zophar appears to be talking just to talk. He calls himself a friend of Job, but the declaration he makes about the inheritance of godless have nothing to do with what we know about Job. Sounds like he was judging and accusing Job just by his position in life. We know that Job was a wealthy man. But we also know he would meet commune with the LORD daily and interceed for others. I don't know any wicked intercessors….just saying. We must be careful to speak out of love and not judgement when we're reaching for the lost. We must guide people no matter who they are to the merciful and forgiving arms of our Lord. How much greater is it to see a loved one for friend break down and let go of their sinful ways while Jesus just holds them in His arms, rather than them turn afraid and alone because we've condemned them for their bad deeds…? Let God be God. We are just a guiding tool and a conduit.

 19 Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not; 
 From the marginal reference here, we learn that the meaning of the last clause is, "He hath not built it up." He took a house that was not his, a house he had not built. Zophar here was brutally charging Job with all kinds of sins, without any evidence whatever; he was multiplying his allegations in the hope of hitting something that might have been true.

 Before we accuse someone of anything we must have proof. Not just go by what others say. Or personal opinion. 
 “You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.

 “You shall not spread a false report. You shall not join hands with a wicked man to be a malicious witness.

Job 20:2‭-‬4 KJV

 There are times where I have to check myself. I have spoken out of turn; it was a thought from God. No; it was me. I now watch what I say and to whom I say it to. I may go days before I say anything. I have to make sure that I'm hearing God and not allowing my flesh to get in the way. People can be turned away from going to the house of God from our/my words. Did I know what was coming this morning, no. A lot of times I have no idea what I'm going to blog, but the Holy Spirit knows. I have to truly make sure that my words are according to the gospel and that they are not just what I want to put down. The flesh can be very deceptive. I may think oh yeah this is of God; but of course this time it was of Joe. Lord thank you for guiding my mind and heart in the word.

 It his important to stay humble and don't let pride and wickedness get in the way. You will loose everything. It is better to be humble and righteous because the reward is plenty. Than to be prideful and wicked because the judgement is many.

 Looking back about 5 year ago i remember someone saying to me you Lost you hearing because you did something God didn't appreciate . I responded back why do you assume that and why do you judge me I believe God got something planned for me. Don't assume just because someone is going through a storm doesn't mean they did something bad

 The wisdom of the world 
 1 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 
2 Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste. 
 I just had a conversation with a coworker of mine. She considers herself a Christian. But when I told her about my weeks schedule for church events and meets this week. She expressed little time I had for myself. My response was," yes, you're right I dont have much time for myself. However, it's not about me, it's about His Kingdom and what we are doing to expand it." She was surprised at my response. 
 The "wisdom" of this world is not that of God. In a world where it's all about how I feel and what make me look good. The Kingdom at hand is what's truly important. 
 Seek ye first the Kingdom

 “the triumph of the wicked has been short lived and the joy of the godless has been only temporary? Though the pride of the godless reaches to the heavens and their heads touch the clouds, yet they will vanish forever, thrown away like their own dung. Those who knew them will ask, ‘Where are they?’ They will fade like a dream and not be found. They will vanish like a vision in the night.” 
‭‭Job‬ ‭20:5-8‬ ‭NLT‬‬ 
 The wicked will disappear and fade like a dream. There is nothing you can do for them but try to pray and encourage them to turn away from sin and follow God so they don’t die lost. The main responsibility of us is to reach out to them. Think of it this way, you are at the edge of a cliff and you see someone hanging on the side, they cannot speak but you can see the look on their face says “Help me”, do you let your insecurities and fear of rejection stop you from reaching out to pull them up? Do you look else where and pretend they are not there? Or do you put your faith into action and help save them so they don’t die lost? How many people do we pass by at work or in the store or in school that are on the edge of their own and we just pass by not reaching out? God help us to be bold! Be blessed today and extend a helping hand, you don’t know how you can change someone’s life.

 You see, this lil feller confessed his folly. This is exactly what we should not do. He says, "My thoughts cause me to answer…" and not only does he answer, but he answers in haste. These are mistakes of character. Verse #3 goes deeper. He says "the spirit of my understanding causes me to answer." We see these "spiritual" folks all the time. They always have a "word" from God. They saw the heavens open up and the angels calling them home, but they told Jesus they wanted to stay here for awhile longer. 
 This lil feller should not have brought such accusations against Job. He should have held his peace. This is what we should do most of the time as well. We might have a word, but let that word come in season under the leadership of the Pastor.

 How many times do we give an answer from our own understanding…when we should seek God for the answer or for direction. We get ourselves in a bind when we follow the natural and not the spiritual.

 This is why my unsettling thoughts compel me to answer, because I am upset! I have heard a rebuke that insults me, and my understanding makes me reply. 
Job 20:2‭-‬3 HCSB 
 Wow. We've gone from "you're probably in this mess because you've sinned and need to repent" to "you're a no-good sinner and you deserve all this and more!" 
 Angry words always escalate. Therefore, the absolute worst time to open our mouths is when our upset thoughts compel us to. Responding in anger will almost always lead us into sin. If we would be godly, then, we must follow the example of our Lord and learn to take insult without retaliation. 
 "He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.' 
Isaiah 53:7 KJV 
 As I quoted a few days ago, anger works not the righteousness of God. Rarely does anything initiated by anger turn out well for the initiator. Anger exposes our uncrucified flesh, prevents us from walking in the Spirit, and corrupts our witness before other men. In short, anger makes a hypocrite of us all, who are professing Christianity. 
 The Word tells us that we must learn to subdue it: 
 Be ye angry, and sin not… 
Ephesians 4:26 KJV 
 This is nearly impossible to do if our mouths are running away with us, for the tongue, especially fueled by anger, is an "unruly evil, full of deadly poison." 
 Finally, we cannot live an angry life and please God at the same time. 
 "And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you." 
Ephesians 4:30‭-‬32 KJV

 1Then Zophar the Naamathite replied: 
2“My troubled thoughts prompt me to answer 
because I am greatly disturbed. 
3I hear a rebuke that dishonors me, 
and my understanding inspires me to reply. 
4“Surely you know how it has been from of old, 
ever since mankind a was placed on the earth, 
5that the mirth of the wicked is brief, 
the joy of the godless lasts but a moment. 
6Though the pride of the godless person reaches to the heavens 
and his head touches the clouds, 
7he will perish forever, like his own dung; 
those who have seen him will say, ‘Where is he?’ NIV 
 Zophar answers the problem precisely of the wicked. Those that are supposedly your friends but are in it for their own agendas. There is a problem with the egos of those that think being prosperous in sin will allow them to reach higher than those that have humility leading them. 
 The society will eventually explode with the wrath of God and destroy the vile of the earth. We have to try to give understanding by preaching the word of God and even though we get rejected we still have to push on. We can not sell God shirt, we can not water down his word to convince others to try it and see if they like it. We have to preach the unadulterated truth and keep the fire burning bright. We are going to have to compel them to come. 
 It’s the truth that will set us free. 
 I love the Kingdom!

 Although the statement above is correct, and there are things the wicked will have to answer for, and time will be paid. However, this wasn't the case for Job. Although, everything stood against him, as if he was wicked, we are not to cast judgment and condemnation on those around us. We don't always have to understand or agree with it all, our mission to seek FIRST the Kingdom. And in doing so, God will lead us through our daily relationships and conversations.

 FIRST THE KINGDOM 
THE KINGS REWARD 
 29 This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God. 
 It seems as we are focused on "Seek FIRST The Kingdom of GOD" there is not much need or thought about what happens to the wicked or those who do not seek to LIVE for GOD. 
 However we learn in this chapter that GOD in HIS infinite wisdom has a plan for those that do not seek FIRST The Kingdom of GOD and choose rather to live a wicked life. 
 As we long for and celebrate the HOPE of Salvation and Eternal Life with JESUS as HE has planned for and prepared. We see that there is also a plan for those that choose to neglect, disobey and refuse the counsel of GOD. Verses 19-28 reveal the plan of GOD for those that choose to not submit to and follow GOD. 
 Choose this day who you will serve.

 MSG - “Such God-denying people are never content with what they have 
or who they are; 
their greed drives them relentlessly. 
They plunder everything 
but they can’t hold on to any of it. 
Just when they think they have it all, disaster strikes; 
they’re served up a plate full of misery. 
When they’ve filled their bellies with that, 
God gives them a taste of his anger, 
and they get to chew on that for a while. 
As they run for their lives from one disaster, 
they run smack into another. 
They’re knocked around from pillar to post, 
beaten to within an inch of their lives. 
They’re trapped in a house of horrors, 
and see their loot disappear down a black hole. 
Their lives are a total loss— 
not a penny to their name, not so much as a bean. 
God will strip them of their sin-soaked clothes 
and hang their dirty laundry out for all to see. 
Life is a complete wipeout for them, 
nothing surviving God’s wrath. 
There! That’s God’s blueprint for the wicked— 
what they have to look forward to. 
 This portion of scripture describes a "hopeless" generation, much like the one we live in. But the Church of the Living God has "hope" to offer them. We must take the initiative and share what we know, the gospel of Jesus Christ with them, giving them an out, an answer, bringing them HOPE. 
 1 Corinthians 15:19 If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.

 Do you not know this from the old days, Since the time that man was placed on the earth, That the triumphing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the godless is only for a moment? 
JOB 20:4‭-‬5 AMP 
 His promise is forever. What ever attacks you qhat ever comes at you, will only last a short while. If your in constant anquish or greif, or somthing or someone is bringing you down, stop and evalute your spiritual life. Granted Job was a faithful man and righteous. But maybe if he would have stopped complaining about his situation, stopped bringing himself down, the trial would have been over a little quicker. We take our earth shattering moments and let them shatter us to the point where it has some long term effects. If we would learn how to boost ourselves up spiritually, the pain would only be there for ahort while. Because we wouldnt let it bother us. We have to remember who we belong to. Who our comforter and protector is. We have to boost our spirits up so that we lean on our faith in him, that he will carry us through.

 When we respond out of anger or hurt feelings, it will almost always come back to bite us. This is because we often are only trying to retaliate, and make them feel the way we felt. But this is not how a “Christ like” person would respond. 
 Instead of giving an immediate response out of anger. We need to learn to take a few breaths and ask Jesus the appropriate way to respond. 
It’s not something easily learned, it will take discipline. But when doing this, we will notice a shift in our attitude. 
 “He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.” 
‭‭Proverbs‬ ‭16:32‬ ‭KJV‬‬ 
 “A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife.” 
‭‭Proverbs‬ ‭15:18‬ ‭KJV‬‬

 The heritage appointed unto him (the wicked man) by God 
Job 20:24-25 
24) He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through. 
25) It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him. 
VERSES 
The heritage of the servants of the LORD 
Isaiah 54:17 
17) No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. 
 For the wicked man, the iron weapon shall strike him through, BUT for the servant of the Lord, NO weapon formed against him shall prosper.

 Sin in this world is only for just a moment or the pleasure of it. When you send that sin can be wiped away by true forgiveness the turning away of that sin. The pleasure of sin is sweet for the flesh but deadly for the spirit. We need to realize That Jesus is forever and his kingdom is eternal And we need to value the kingdom in Jesus more than our personal sinful desires.

 5the triumph of the wicked has been short lived 
and the joy of the godless has been only temporary? 
 Yes, sin a a spur of the moment thing. It’s to satisfy your flesh instantly. But sin slowly erodes your spiritual connection with God. We have to constantly praise and worship God to keep sin away.

 28 The increase of his house will depart, and his goods will flow away in the day of His wrath. This is the portion from God for a wicked man, the heritage appointed to him by God.

 Though the pride of the godless reaches to the heavens and their heads touch the clouds, yet they will vanish forever, thrown away like their own dung. Those who knew them will ask, ‘Where are they?’ 
Job 20:6‭-‬7 NLT 
The pride of the godless will certainly be the end of them. Pride always sets God's law in motion. 
Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall. 
Proverbs 16:18 KJV 
The fear of the Lord is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate. 
Proverbs 8:13 KJV 
And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted. 
Matthew 23:12 KJV 
God hates selfish pride. Therefore, the proud will not be exalted.

 Job 20: 1-29 Zophar’s focuses on two key ideas: the prosperity of the wicked is short, and his doom is sure. 
 v.29 This is a portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God. 
 v.26 All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him ; It shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle/tent. 
 Psalms 21:9 Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the Lord shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.

 Though this does not necessarily pertain to Job, it is however true. While Job is going though the darkness of trials, the wicked are living lavish. The glory that this world has to offer is only temporary. Even though the struggle Job feels must be excruciating, his reward will be double and eternal for his faithfulness.

 The God of peace is able to lift us up even when others want to put us down. We must not allow the enemy to win the battle. God has given us the tools to be able to stop the enemy in his tracks.

 With an evil doer, a wicked man, a bad person, a sinner, etc. they are only happy with their wrong doings for a short time before they fond something wrong in another area. A hypocrite only has joy for a moment as well. 
 1 His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust. 
 Their whole persona has been afflicted since they were young and will follow them to the grave if they stay a sinner. 
 21 There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods. 
 What a sad life that no one looks up to for advice or direction. 
 29 This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God. 
 These things are appointed by God himself. Just in these few things alone why would a person want to sin, so wrong or backslide?? Why is the sin worth risking the eternal prize??

 2 Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste. 
 3 I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.

 “Do you not know this of old, Since man was placed on earth, That the triumphing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment? 
Job 20:4‭-‬5 NKJV 
 Sometimes it may seem like the evil doers get their way and that no repercussions happen. But the Lord is the one that has all under his control. He will see fit administer justice.

 Faithful men and women will suffer hurt. Hurt is not bias God will reign on the just and I just. The reality is we have to decide if we are humble enough to suffer hirt and put our total trust in God

 “Then Zophar the Naamathite replied, "My troubled thoughts force me to answer you. That's because I'm very upset. What you have just said makes fun of me. So I really have to reply to you.” 
‭‭Job‬ ‭20:1-3‬ ‭NIRV‬‬ 
 ““I have heard the reproof which insults me, But the spirit of my understanding makes me answer.” 
‭‭JOB‬ ‭20:3‬ ‭AMP‬‬ 
 But do you REALLY have to reply?? I guess if you’re go off of your OWN understanding it would cause you to act out of Christ-like character. We are to lean not to our OWN UNDERSTANDING but to trust and acknowledge HIM and He will direct our paths.
