 Hello! 
 Thanks for checking out our job description for a remote  **UX/UI Designer  **at Impala. We felt a little bit impersonal just diving straight in with words like "revolutionising" and "disrupting". 
 As such, we apologise in advance for any cliches, tropes or sudden-insecurity-driven-panic-attacks that you might find in the description below. 
 All that aside though, we're pretty proud to be listed number 2 in London's best startups to work at in 2021. 
 What is Impala? 
 If you're keen to   be on the frontline of creating never-before-seen travel technology   and   experiences  , you belong at Impala. At Impala we're solving an   exciting, complex problem   that has held back the hotel industry, if not the entire travel industry, for 20 years. 
 Forget following emerging technology trends -- we're looking to SET them! 
 Impala is making the process of booking hotel rooms ridiculously easy. In short, we're providing hotels with powerful data distribution infrastructure. 
 More practically, we're making the world a better place for guests, hotels, and online travel agents of any size.   Think Twilio for Travel. 
 We're looking for self-motivated folks to expand our high-performance team. You'll be a brilliant fit if you're obsessed with **  self-development, Stripe-level quality & reliability, smashing targets, and moving at a red-hot pace** (hello, start-up life!) 
 Covid-19 has forced almost every industry in the world to adjust in 2020, and none more so than the travel industry. It is however, an exciting time to be in   Travel Tech   ,   with endless opportunities opened up for innovation and forward-thinking that will help jump start the travel industry. Here at Impala, that's our goal! Backed by some of Europe's leading investors, we're on the cusp of launching a product that will connect people and travel once again. 
 A brief overview of what you will be doing here: 
 By joining Impala as a UX/UI Designer, you will be integral to developing and designing new and existing products which help us achieve our mission. 
 You will collaborate closely with product managers to develop incredible user experiences and own all components of UI design, with the scope to set the standard and vision for Design at Impala. 
 You should join us if you: 
 
 You have   strong visual design skills   and are excited to own all elements of this for new and existing products 
 You have   experience leading UX and UI design across multiple product teams   and take a holistic approach to problem-solving 
 You believe   user-centricity and high-quality design should be at the core of every design decision   and advocate for this 
 You can **  iterate quickly** and are experienced in designing solutions at various stages of fidelity e.g. sketches. wireframes, finalised designs 
 You have experience   developing user journeys   for B2B products 
 You're   familiar with modern tools for design collaboration and prototyping   (InVision, Figma etc) 
 You   enjoy performing user research   and using the results of that to constantly improve the products we build 
 You are   highly collaborative   and enjoy working with multiple teams across the business 
 You   have strong design opinions   but are happy to have your mind changed 
 You enjoy engaging in ideation rather than just being directed and are   excited by bringing designs from concept to completion 
 
 You shouldn 't join us if (we want to be as honest and transparent as we can): 
 
 You value stability in a product and company, over change and fast-growth. 
 You think lofty goals are better left to renovation builders. 
 
 Where is Impala going? 
 We're supported by some of the most respected investors in the business, the early-stage backers behind Deliveroo, PillPack, SecretEscapes, Zoopla, Trivago, Monzo, Travelperk, Transferwise, Airbnb, GetYourGuide, Omio, Spotify and more! 
 They're on board because of the shared opportunity we have before us -   revolutionising a 1.6 trillion dollar market that 's been out-of-date for 20 years. 
 They also share our vision of a future in which **  travel is seamlessly connected and relentlessly inventive.** 
 Anyone travelling anywhere will interact with products powered by Impala. Our technology is already installed in hundreds of hotels worldwide, on six continents and categorises more than 1 billion data points. 
 Where will you work? 
 We employ anyone in Europe within +/2h GMT, on a fully remote basis. 
 We are a remote-first company. This was a very deliberate, natural choice, as we prioritise preserving work-life balance and accommodating the best people in Europe, while also fostering diversity. 
 We have loads of remote initiatives to ensure you're fully setup ! 
 
 We offer a monthly   £ 150   office stipend   - to furnish your home office, or just to purchase things like coffee, snacks, wifi bills, cleaning, desk equipment, plants, plus anything in between.

 In addition, we give you a generous   Personalised Workspace Budget   for bigger things like monitors, keyboards, desk chairs and headphones. 
 We will give you a brand   new high-spec laptop   when you start, giving you the choice between a Thinkpad or Mac. 
 We have a dedicated   Remote Experience Manager   in the team, whose role is, among other things, to ensure your happiness, and help you integrate and be empowered whilst working remotely.

 You'll work for a company truly   passionate about D &I  to the extent that we made a   D &I Deck . You can help build a company that intends to support diversity and inclusion at the grassroots. 
 We're   Flexified  , meaning we've been officially approved as a flexible workplace. 
 You can see our   full (and ultra-flexible)   Benefits Package   here . 
 About the team 
 We've always optimised for quality over quantity when expanding our team, and we'd always rather run a team lean than simply fill seats for speed. 
 That means that we have Star teams full of Star players, across the board at Impala -- all of whom work to mutually elevate and support each other. 
 We're a group of   high-performing, fast-moving, innovation-bent and product-obsessed individuals  , who don't take ourselves too seriously. 
 **Sound interesting?  ** 
 Apply if you want to bring your   innovation bent and product-obsession   to help change the game in travel.
