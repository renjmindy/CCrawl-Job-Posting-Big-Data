 Bertram Captain and President Alton Herndon with Hans Kux 
 SU-O1.- May 2012.- Last year BERTRAM made waves with the 50th Anniversary “  blast from the past”  celebration; even though growing was the natural upcoming for the historic USA founded brand, nobody thought they will be in the need to say good bye to Miami. 
 
 New facilities in Merritt Island Fl.

 The USA founded shipyard (specialize in luxury fishing yachts) was holding under the sleeve the news of a huge step in their New Era; BERTRAM is moving away from their historic operating and manufacturing operation site in the hearth of Miami. 
 
 BERTRAM's Press conference in New Home 
Conferencia de Prensa en la Casa Nueva de BERTRAM 
 The move responds to 2 mayor factors: the new luxury development in the surrounding area near by the Miami International airport where BETRAM has been operating for 50 years and the demand for larger yachts witch where almost impossible to build in their current facilities. 
 
 FL. State Rep. Steve Crisafulli 
Rep, del Edo, de la Florida 
 The inevitable move it was done and new BETRAM facilities are getting ready now in the Space Coast in Merritt Island, in the Brevard County Fl. That’s why they had a “VIP Blast Tour & Lunch” opening for the press, workers and friends. 
 State Representative Steve Crisafulli, County Commissioner Chuck Nelson and Bob Whelen Chairman of the Board of the EDC (Economic Development Commission) where the officials who welcome all visitors and the BERTRAM executives;

 but the one who always take the house down is BERTRAM’s President  Alton Hendron  who is one of the most grounded bosses in the industry. 
 With great sense of humor and huge excitement,  Alton Hendron  explained the move and announced the New Era of BERTRAM with larger production in quantity, quality and the care of the environmental measures they are taking to be ahead of any other brand, but most at all the fact that BETRAM will stay in the state it was born, Florida:

 “In BETRAM Yacht we deeply value our 50 years of history and culture in the State of Florida and we are enthusiastic to remain in the State” he declare to the press and he got more than enthusiastic to announce the increasing labor platform from 125 employees that are working in the company to 221, 96 will be recruiting to cover the production expecting for the end of 2012. 
 
 Exclusive Interview with BERTRAM CEO 
Entrevista Exclusiva 
 In exclusive and due the rumor that “Ferretti Group” which BERTRAM belongs to it, could be sell to Chinese prospects,  Mr Hendron  declare: There is nothing definitive yet, however the negotiations are more incline to the “investing” term that the ownership” he concludes 
 Alton Hendron  , assures the quality and the manufacturing of the BERTRAM yacht won’t be influenced by any investors if that was the concern. 
 In the same subject CEO and Founder of Ferretti Group,  Norberto Ferretti  , not only endorse  Mr. Herndon  statement but clarify, that the Chinese deal is not a new kind of investment opportunity for the Asians in the Ferretti Group, but a “win-win” opportunity for all the parties involved as it has been with Brazil, where there is a  Ferretti  manufacturer, operations facility and show room to attend the demand of their faithful costumers in that country.

 Therefore  Mr. Ferretti  afrim “If the negotiations with the Chinese get to a close deal, it will be just in the financial sector and won’t change the quality in the design of affect any other decision made in any of the brands of the group, neither the manufacturing process in USA, nor to affect the Historical BERTRAM brand…  Mr.Ferretti  continues….If the Chinese demand for our products we will be open to build and work in their country to bring a product for their own consumption” he concludes.And with that the celebration for the new facility in their “Made in America” historic brand BERTRAM, continues  Mr.Ferretti  clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of the leadership and the amazing Group reorganization that embrace 8 luxury motor-yachts production brands. 
 
 BETRAM WAY ! 
 BERTRAM is so welcome in Merritt Island that the new address also has it name “1230 Bertram Way”, this iconic brand will start operating in this location next month, however the larger 37 acres facility is getting ready to be in full function for October 2012; using environmentally sound manufacturing practices including a low emission lamination process that incorporate infusion techniques to manufacture fiberglass parts.

 When I worked at Bertram in 1980 they chose to stay and built a big expansion at their HQ in Miami. They threatened to leave to the Jupiter area then, before the expansion, because of all the crime from the Liberty City riots, Mariel boatlift, plus more. 
 The Miami city government made a deal to keep Bertram there. As an employee that commuted from Boca Raton and couldn't afford to live in Miami (yes the real estate/rent was more expensive than Boca) and because of the crime, I left and went to the Melbourne area. Now Bertram moved - 30 years too late - just up the road from Melbourne! Timing is everything. 
 Rosana, do you work for or with Bertram in PR?

 Hello R. Michael Brown… Wow very nice of you to share your testimony about a Great American Legend as it's Bertram… Well on my understanding they are growing so maybe you can apply your experience to the New Era! 
About your question NO, I don't work for the company…They have a very active lady in PR and Media relations. 
However it's possible the group that now Bertram belongs can be interested in go far with our Nautical World TV, in more active way. 
I really appreciate the time you took to write your comment and share with us. 
Kind Regards Ü
