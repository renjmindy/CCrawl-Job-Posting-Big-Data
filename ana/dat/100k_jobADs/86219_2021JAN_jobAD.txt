 The Weighing man 
 The Weighing man 
 There is a machine standing tall, near him. It is the Delhi Weighing machine. Funny is the name as it's got no connection with Delhi. Though it does two jobs of weighing and measuring height. And he charges 2 rupees for a person. Hundreds of people walk past, noticing everything except him and the machine. Out of which one might notice him on his lucky day. On a luckier day he might get a 50 rupees. On one such a lucky day, when given 20 rupees he rejected and returned it, saying he's got no change. Still there are people for whom honesty comes first than anything else. 
 Salute to the everyday heroes!
