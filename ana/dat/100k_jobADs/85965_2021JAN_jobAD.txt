 4 Reasons why people stay in jobs they hate 
 If the mere thought of Mondays and waking up for work makes you cringe, then it’s safe to assume that you hate your job. We often ignore our need for transformation in our careers because the concept of change is one that is frightening and filled with uncertainty- all of which could be considered an inconvenience when you’ve gone on to find comfort in your misery. People would much rather stay in their secure yet unfulfilling jobs than to embark on the seemingly terrifying journey of change. 
 In the early 1960’s David Gleicher created the formula for change. This formula was later simplified by Kathleen Dannemiller and presented in 1992 as such: 
 D x V x F > R 
 i.e. Dissatisfaction (with the status quo) x Vision (of future possibilities) x First Steps (towards change) > Resistance (to change) 
 Coincidentally, the above-mentioned factors of change can be related to the reasons why people stay in jobs they hate. The dissatisfaction in your current job must be just enough for you to make a change. Sure, you’re certain that you want to leave your job but what do you envision yourself doing outside of it? Taking the first step is often the hardest and can demotivate people to leave their unhappy work environment; and the obstacles you might face along the way and the fears you have to overcome seem too taunting to bare- all of which play a role in you staying in an uninspiring space. 
 1. Dissatisfaction 
 Your dissatisfaction with your current job or circumstance must be enough to bring you to action. If your dissatisfaction is such that you complain about it, but do nothing, change is not likely to happen. 
 2.Vision 
 Often people’s dissatisfaction is great enough, but they have no vision of what they want to do in their careers. They cannot visualise what the alternative to their current circumstance can be. In the absence of such a vision, any action is directionless and will not amount to the desired change. The Soapbox Franchise Group not only provides you with a clear vision of what it is like to be your own boss and owning your own business, we also provide you with a clear plan of how to achieve this. 
 3.   First Steps 
 The third factor in the formula for change is taking the first steps toward change. Many people never take these first steps, because they either lack the courage, or they lack the knowledge of what the first steps will be. The Soapbox Franchise Group has more than a decade of experience in the corporate fashion industry and can help you with the knowledge, and a proven model for success. 
 4. Resistance 
 Resistance to change can be internal (fear, anxiety, insecurity, discomfort) or external (family, friends, authoritative figures). It is very important to have an honest look at the resistance factors in your life and identify them. Ask yourself if these factors will still be a factor in 10 years from now. And ask yourself if you can afford to stay where you are. 
 At Soapbox Group we know that change is hard, but we love to walk the path of change with each one of our franchisees and see them grow into the careers they envisioned.
