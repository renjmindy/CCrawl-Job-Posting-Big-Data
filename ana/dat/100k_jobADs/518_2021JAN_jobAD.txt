 It is unbelievable how clearing your MBA creates a  herd mentality  when it comes to career choice. All finance & Banking majors want to be in Treasury. Most HR passouts want to do OD…etc etc. And believe me they have no clue what the job entails. 
 Now & then I come across those who  refuse a bigger role  cause the company is not revising the salary while offering the new role. They say “  Why should I work more for the same salary?”  In the long run, these are the same people who usually hear from their employer “  Why will I give you more salary for the same job ?” 
 I recollect an incident when an employee had put in his resignation. When I asked him the reason, he said “  I have completed 3 yrs  ”, I waited for him to finish the sentence when I realized that he had in fact completed explaining the reason. Jobs should not change with a season, but the question is – Are you  leaving for the right reason ? 
 Your career decisions have to be taken like any other work decision – dispassionately, weighing all facts. Taking an  emotional career decision  is as bad as taking a mathematical decision about whom you should marry. 
 Strong trend these days where the lines between being jugaadu and  being unethical  have blurred. “  Oh I just put the wrong dates on my resume by mistake”.” Oh I didn’t know I wasn’t supposed to borrow money from my team member  ”. “  I didn’t get an increment and so I claimed the conveyance .” Please please do not set your own rules of conduct. Please follow the organisation’s code of conduct. One small mistake and your career is set back by a few years. 
 “  I  **  don’t get along with my Boss **  ” . It’s like saying I don’t get along with my customer. Most of the times it’s your loss. You don’t have to be a Yes Man, but you don’t have to be a rebel either. 
 _“I  don’t know what I want  to do_”. Trust me no one can tell you what is right for you. And if you must hear it from someone else, please let it be someone who understands your strengths and has personally accomplished much. 
 Problem with a lot of Gen-X employees: They believe that knowing how to do their job is more important than their  People Skills . While Knowledge & functional skills help you more in your early career, after some point, it’s a lot about your Interpersonal Skills. You need your team, your colleagues as much as they need you. 
 Your  Comfort zone  is your biggest enemy. It’s like a slow addiction to smoking. You start finding reasons why it is ok to smoke and after sometime even if you want to quit, its v v hard. Make sure you are constantly upgrading yourself. There are very few buyers for obsolete stock. 
 And lastly, managing your career is like managing your children. You can’t  give less and expect more . It usually works the other way round. 
 
 More on each of these in my coming posts……

 Very interesting perspective. What's even more interesting is where you spoke about mathematical decisions not being right at the time of marriage, being practical is a mantra that Gen Y and more interesting Gen M follow. But the lines do become blur there also. Career is matter of one's choice. One needs to stand strongly for that and not end up making the 3 mistakes Chetan Bhagat speaks so well through his book or Kai Po Che through its characterisation and story.

 I can see a reflection somewhere for my past mistakes (less than 3!). Being emotional and leaving job is sure shot recipe for career suicide. Sometimes difficult time has to be negated but don't know how part?

 Agree with DK on "interesting perspective". The current crop takes a lot of things for granted. Most are not ready for the grind & are in a lot of hurry. We just cannot debate the upon the importance of "Ethics" this is paramount for one to succeed in any field / walk of life. The biggest mistake is to be & remain in ones "Comfort Zone", as if you do not challenge yourself then one will just loose out on the "unexpected". 
Most important is to love what you do & one will never ever have the need to work.

 Thanks Percy. I think while Gen Y comes with a lot of things that make us want to pull our hair apart, they do bring some good skills like Innovation, relationships and Speed which our generation is not the best at. I like the line on loving your work. Completely agree with you.

 Hi HV, 
a very interesting perspective and quite correct with the for today's scenario. The need for a change in job is related to the materialistic and societal approvals attached to the role we currently are in. However, I would love read a blogpost on your opinions on how employers need to manage the Gen X and Gen Y employees. 
Await the next post from you

 Nicely written Hamsaz…. especially like the line, "managing your career is like managing your children". You can’t give less and expect more. So true… I see few people with the determination to pay the price for greatness. They expect life to be handed over to them on a platter… 
 Can't wait to read your future posts…

 Nicely captured.. 
 Now when I look back about how I got into HR…it was just "Luck by chance". It was not well thought through decision infact I was in customer service and had no clue about HR. Thanks to Osborne (My ex-boss) who was our trainer and gave me an opportunity of moving to HR .. then started my whole new journey. I am sure there will be lots of people who won't know which career path they should opt for..what is good for them as per their strengths, interests etc. 
 Another point about giving less and expecting more from children is bang on. I have not given much time to my kids studies this year but now during exam time I expect them to be well prepared…it's funny….how it is possible? 
 We need to keep honing our skills through training, assignments and build our career step by step. 
 Anyways as they say yeh dil maange more…apna dil bhi always maange more..so keep blogging more:-)

 Hi Ashu, I dont think your career is 'luck by chance'. Its a result of a good leader who recognised your true calling. And about your kids studies, you have taught them to be independent and that they dont need someone else to drive them. Thats a better learning than just academia 🙂

 “managing your career is like managing your children. You can’t give less and expect more." 
Sometimes this is the other way around. People think they are giving more than what is expected out of them but still they are compensated less than what they should be getting. Such thoughts are another set of ways to lose your career. One should never think that he is giving anything more than what is expected since he/she is there to prove that his hard-work has no limits until and unless it is appreciated someday. And going by my personal experience, it is surely & surprisingly appreciated some or the other day and that adds a damn good amount of confidence and positivism towards your work thereafter. 
 Nice points to avoid to help the career growing… Thanks Hamsaaz! 
Awaiting more here… 🙂
