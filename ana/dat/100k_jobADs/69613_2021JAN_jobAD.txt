 A NEW TWIST ON PARR 
 In the last few years as the number of resumes submitted for jobs has grown the PARR format has come under some criticism for being too “verbose.” Human Resources staffs have been trimmed and the remaining staffs handling positions are swamped with resumes from both qualified and unqualified candidates. 
 So, I read about a new format that was explained by a professional staffer from  www.TheLadders.com 
 It allows you to still use the information from a PARR analysis but in a shortened way. 
 RESULTS BY… 
 So, now you can shorten the language but use the Results column along with the Resolution column to place a significant bullet that will attract the attention of three things or people: 
 
 Resume Scanner 
 Human Resources staff 
 Hiring Manager 
 
 What this does is gets Results or Resolution up front for the reader’s eyes and minimizes the time explaining the problem. So, let’s use our example from above that we placed in the PARR format: 
 
 IMPROVED CUSTOMER CREDIT and MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY: Added  $100,000  to company revenues through improved credit processes. Improved collections by  15%  , decreased charge-back investigations by  10%  , and speeded up the credit approval process. Accomplished this by taking responsibility for all credit-related issues and writing appropriate internal rules to address issues. 
 
 Well, that’s a view for a process that will help you get through “the forest and the trees” when starting or restarting your career. I would urge you to try using PARR as an exercise before you write a resume. 
 Also, your PARR will become your “snippets” of information that you want to feed back to the hiring company. The first few bullet points on your resume should directly address their specified need for the position. If what you’ve done that is directly related to their need is on Page 3 of your resume then you won’t hit the mark. You only have about 8 seconds to attract attention to your resume! Get what the company wants on Page 1 of your resume. 
 Here’s where I preach some heresy to career coaches. I use what I call a  “Mini-Hybrid” resume . So, I try to match the first four or five job requirements that the hiring company has specified to the first portion on Page 1 of the resume. My bullets from my “snippets” list directly correspond to their needs. 
 A career coach has stated that you must answer the Requirements for the position not the Duties and Responsibilities. That’s easier said than done since I could write the War & Peace version of how companies have forgotten or lost the ability to write a succinct job description. I can tell you that Jason and the Argonauts are still looking for The Golden Fleece and a well written job description. 
 In any event, if the company states in their Requirements: 
 
 Need to improve customer credit processes, increase collections, and decrease charge-back investigations to speed up the credit approval process 
 
 Then your answer to solve their problem had better be on Page 1 of your resume, not on Page 2 or 3. Remember, you have 8 seconds to get that in front of their eyes. 
 
 IMPROVED CUSTOMER CREDIT and MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY: Added  $100,000  to company revenues through improved credit processes. Improved collections by  15%  , decreased charge-back investigations by  10%  , and speeded up the credit approval process. Accomplished this by taking responsibility for all credit-related issues and writing appropriate internal rules to address issues.

 PARR: Gateway for Your Career Search -- Part A of Two Parts

 PARR: Gateway for Your Career Search 
 Assessing your skills before you write your resume 
 Part A: Creating Your PARR Tool for Your Career Search 
 Part A of a two-part series on PARR 
 By

 In today’s turbulent work environment people can find themselves in a few status stages: 
 
 Recent college grad or 20-Something Gen Y 
 Returning to Work after Child Rearing or Elder Care status 
 Over 45 – 65 and facing “long-term” unemployed status, skills not up to date, or age discrimination 
 Unemployed – suddenly laid off, downsized, right-sized, or job eliminated 
 
 Many people have a shock period with emotional lows, worries about family and economic issues, then an onset of reality. At that point they sit down and immediately want to create a resume so they can start looking for a job. 
 As anyone knows who’s been through the myriad of career coaches, books, and webinars there are numerous ways to write a resume. Many people will agree that if you line up 100 people to review your resume that you will get 100 different opinions. 
 Some years ago I invested nearly $500 dollars for a professional resume writer to prepare my resume. The short story is that he in turn passed off the assignment to someone else “on his team”. What I got back was a document with misspellings, incomplete sentences, and sentences that made no sense. I had to reach back out to the original writer and express my dissatisfaction. He then worked directly with me to create a new resume. 
 However, what I remembered about the entire process was the reams of paperwork that the writer demanded I prepare before a resume could be written. Ironically, at that time I had a friend going through the same process with a different resume service. We compared notes and essentially came to the conclusion: that the entire process was like walking over hot coals. 
 Years later, I acquired the services of a well known career coach in the New Jersey area. He too had a process and one element he required was the same as the resume writer. My career coach was quite surprised when I handed in my first draft of this requirement and he said, “You’ve got this done pretty well.” 
 It’s called PARR: Problem, Action, Resolution, Results 
 You may have heard the same expressed as PAR, CAR, SARB, and other acronyms. 
 Here’s why you want to use PARR before you start a resume especially if you are in any of the categories that I described above. 
 PARR takes you out of resume thinking mode and forces you into a deeper thinking mode. It makes you reassess all of your experience throughout your entire career. That could start at the local supermarket when you were a teen all the way up to your most recent position. Precisely, that’s what it’s intended to do – detach you from resume writing mode to thinker and analyst mode. You’re analyzing your own career in a way that you’ve probably never done before. 
 Here’s how it looks in reality. Open up a new MS Word document and put it in landscape mode. Then insert a table of four columns. Add a series of rows for your input. I would use MS Word here and not MS Excel because most of your input will be verbiage not numbers or equations. 
 PROBLEM 
 | 
 ACTION 
 | 
 RESOLUTION 
 | 
 RESULTS 
 ---|---|---|--- 
 | 
 | 
 | 
 | 
 | 
 | 
 | 
 | 
 | 
 | 
 | 
 | 
 Add as many rows as you may need, it may be multiple pages. 
 Here’s a sample: 
 PROBLEM 
 | 
 ACTION 
 | 
 RESOLUTION 
 | 
 RESULT 
 ---|---|---|--- 
 Customer credit 
 The company had a problem with customer collections, charge-back investigations, and credit approvals. 
 | 
 Took responsibility for all credit-related issues and wrote appropriate internal rules to address issues. 
 | 
 This improved collections by 15%, decreased charge-back investigations by 10%, and speeded up the credit approval process. 
 | 
 The improved credit process added $100,000 to company revenues. 
 So, now you have defined a specific challenge / problem that you handled, the action you took, the resolution (that may or may not include a numeric value), and a result that should be numeric in value. 
 One of the major challenges that I have as a marketing person is that in the old classical marketing days there was often no feedback – either numeric or qualitative – on a given campaign. Today, as I often half-jokingly say, “You can’t put a stamp on an envelope without a Return on Investment (ROI) on the campaign.” 
 That’s especially true in the digital marketing world and most of marketing in general.
