 Reece get's the job! 
 November 7, 2019 
 Reece Moss, 15, has been given a new role within Youth Drama as the Youth Representitive, and will be working alongside current Youth Leader, Donna Robinson. 
 Reece, who has been with VML for some time has proved very popular with his peers in the group, and is the perfect choice to help mentor and steer the younger participants, under the guidance of Donna. 
 Well done Reece, we know you will be great!
