 some advice for job interviews :) 
  For various reasons, I get to be part of job interviews from time to time. I was expressing some of my advice to my kids last night at dinner about some important things to do & not do, when interviewing for a job so I thought I'd pass along a few of these ideas. You are, of course, welcome to disagree, comment & make adjustments with these ideas, but I thought I'd throw out a few thoughts: 
 
 you only get one opportunity to make a 1st impression, so be intentional about what impression you want to make on people (clothing, resume, intelligent, professional, helpful, etc) 
 be confident but not cocky - present yourself as a person who wants to add value & solve problems 
 if you interview by skype, look at the person on the screen as if you're having a conversation because you are ðŸ™‚ If you fidget, look away, take phone calls, etc this makes the person doing the interview feel like you're not interested 
 don't be on time, be  early  , only if you want to seriously be considered for the job 
 research the company for whom you're applying - this tells them that you  want  to work there; find out what is important to the company 
 if possible, be prepared with samples of your work related to the job interview or with a plan of how you have thought about doing the job for which you're interviewing 
 pray - everyone needs some divine help ðŸ™‚ 
 
 Just a few ideas ðŸ™‚

 Thanks! I agreeâ€¦ Questions you never want to ask in a job interview are things that you can find out easily from other sources. Stay away from salary and benefit questions.

 I agree with all the tips. Praying is the most brilliant thing you must do to have guidance and confident when having a job interview. Just always be yourself and always smile.
