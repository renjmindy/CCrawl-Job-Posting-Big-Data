 What I didn’t accomplish in 2020 
 What I didn’t accomplish in 2020 
 31/12/2020  by  mylifelizabeth  ♥  1 Comment 
 Last year on the 1/1/2020 I wrote a blog post about what my  2020  goals were. This was 3 month before the pandemic, before the world shut down. Non of us could predict what year this would become but I'm sure everyone is happy that we're saying goodbye tonight. 
 Last year I had this on my new year's resolution list: 
 
 WRITE IN MY GRATEFUL JOURNAL EACH DAY 
 FAST IN RAMADAN 
 WORKOUT & FINISH 5K RUN 
 FOLLOW THE 12 HOUR FAST 
 TRAVEL – AMSTERDAM, ISLAND…? 
 KØBENHAVN BOAT TRIP 
 MAJOR 25TH BIRTHDAY PRESENT 
 CONTINUE MAKING YOUTUBE VIDEOS 
 POST ON IG AGAIN…? (BIG QUESTIONMARK) 
 BUY LESS IN 2020 
 SEW A DOLL FOR MY DAUGHTER 
 SEARCH FOR A FULL TIME JOB 
 GET MY MOTORCYCLE LICENSE IN 2020 
 
 I can honestly say that I did not accomplish all of these goals. Some I were unable to do because of the strict travel ban & I didn't feel safe travelling otherwise. Others I was too hesitant to try and scared of the criticism I would receive. My list for 2021 is not long, in fact - I didn't write one for this year. I always seem to fall short of them anyway and I don't want to disappoint myself. I do believe I would benefit from more routines and structure in my life next year. Like having specific days to workout, filming youtube videos, bed time routine and so forth. 
 These are the things I didn't accomplish in 2020: 
 
 I  did not  write in my Grateful Journal every day (but I came very close). 
 I  did not  finish a 5k run. 
 I  did not  travel this year. 
 I  did not  take a boat trip to København. 
 I  did not  post on IG again. 
 I  did not  buy less in 2020, unfortunately. 
 I  did not  sew a doll for my daughter (but I bought her one). 
 
 I am however very proud to have fasted in Ramadan, having a great 25th birthday where we went to an amusement park and rented a tiny house on Airbnb. I searched for more jobs at the end of the year and also went on interviews. Most of all I'm proud to finally have my motorcycle license. A dream of mine for as long as I can remember. 
 **Let 's look forward to a brighter future & hope for a great 2021. **

 So everyone is in bed which is unusual because I’m never the one to be up alone in the evening. But I really do want to get my new years resolutions down on paper, or better yet - computer. And I thought I would share them with you as well.

 New years eve is always this big fuss and you'd think it will be a huge moment when the clock strikes twelve but most often than not it’s just another minute passing us by. ** Suddenly we’ve past a decade and looking at the fireworks welcoming a new year.  **Beginnings are always nice because they mean a fresh and maybe even different start for so many. But at the end of the day it’s just a new day that welcomes us. We are lucky to witness it and we should count our luck and be grateful for another year. 
 
 Do you have any new years resolutions - if so what are they?

 1th to 5th of January - Edinburgh, Scotland 
Like most years I was eager to discover more of the world and I was happy to finally book my plane ticket to Scotland where I would visit my cousin. She’s the one person in my family that I can actually share everything with. I got driven to the airport & when I was about to say goodbye I chocked on my own tears. I was so sad to leave my son behind for the first time but at the same time I was so ready to do so. I couldn’t even give him a kiss cause I knew I would be balling my eyes out if I did. After an almost tearful goodbye and very empty flight I was in Edinburgh for the next 5 days. Blogpost  here . 
   
   
   
   
   
 8th of January - Last day as a hairdresser 
After a relaxing start to the new year I found myself back at work Monday the 8th. To our surprise my boss had reported the salon where I worked at to bankruptcy. Suddenly the stable job I had was out of my reach. The next morning the salon was permantly closed. I walked out the front door Monday night never to see my colleagues again. 
 15th of January - Jacob’s 1st birthday 
One week later my son had his first birthday. He was turning one and I decided to invite my family and best friend to the celebration. Inspired by my British holiday I tried to bake scones which turned out to taste like bread. Nevertheless we had cupcakes, banana cake, coffee and my son had a few presents. 
   
   
   
 15th of March - Started my weekly vlogs 
Being unemployed for the last weeks made me itching to do something creative. I still made my weekly videos on Youtube but I wanted to up my game. I started filming weekly vlogs. For now they've only lasted 30 weeks but it was a good go and maybe I’ll feel the need to start again in the future. See my first weekly vlog  here . 
 30th of March - Celebrated my mum’s birthday @ Latter 
My mum turned yet another year older & my brother and I went out with her to a comedy club. Right in the middle of easter week and to our surprise the place was full. Some good but mostly inappropriate jokes where made and I wasn’t in my bed until the early night of the next day. 
   
   
 23rd of April - Started a new job 
After almost 3 month of job searching, countless turn downs and a handful of interviews I finally goy my dream job. At the time all I wanted to do was work in retail & I couldn’t believe my luck when my former boss called me to congratulate me on the position. I was over the moon with a great raise, personal discounts and a great boss. I felt like this was the beginning of a new career. 
 17th of May - My 3rd Ramadan 
Three weeks into my new job, Ramadan was yet again upon us. A time I was looking forward to but anxious to meet since this would be my first Ramadan where I would fast for 30 days. Watch my Ramadan preparation video  here . 
 28th of June - Hottest summer yet 
Living in the northern part of the globe it would have you believe that our summers are mild and bearable, maybe to the point where you’d say this isn’t summer weather at all. Well, this year that all changed. We had around 25-30 degrees from about May to July. Though most people couldn’t believe their luck, I was most nervous for the drought while sweeting buckets 5 minutes after I’ve left the house (almost). 
   
   
   
   
   
 24th of July - We bought our first motorcycle 
A long dream of mine was to get my motorcycle licenses and when my husband joined in on that dream we made it a reality. He had passed his driver’s exam and the only logical conclusion was to buy a new MC. So we did, a Yamaha MT 03. 
 9th to 12th of August - Venice, Italy 
I was itching for another holiday and Venice had been on my ‘to-see’ list for a good while now. So when my mum was on board with the idea and I finally found a dissent hotel - we booked our flight and were on our way. Even more hotter and humid than you can imagine but so beautiful. A lot of tourism but I’m very glad I got to check that place of my bucket list. We had absolute nothing planned that week, other than eating a lot of spagetti, pizza, drinking amazing Italian coffee and gelato. Watch my holiday video  here . 
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
 3rd of October - Our 2nd positive pregnancy test 
Since the mid of summer we decided to expand our family yet again and actually ‘planned’ our 2nd pregnancy. I always knew I wanted my children to be close in age so when I finally took a pregnancy test, after being 1 week late, it was the perfect time. Now I’m 18 weeks pregnant and so eager to know how our new life will look like. 
 **26th of October - Finally got our marriage licences ** 
After 3 years my husband and I finally went down to city hall & legally got married by Norwegian law. We had our Nikkah on the 24th of October 2015 but I wanted to wait until I was at a better place with my family to tell them that this was the man I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. It was a Friday afternoon, my husband & son and myself went down there and 10 minutes later we were officially married by the eyes of the law.

 Reminiscing over summer memories

 It’s been a minute since I've written for you. To be honest I don't know how to start again. But the longer I procrastinated the more I missed it. 
 The last you heard from me was when Ramadan was ending. I was genuinely sad that such a blessed month was leaving us, and I guess I was scared not to be able to continue on with my new habits after Ramadan had left. I took a 30 day cleanse from social media which I desperately needed and to this day I have still not installed Instagram on my phone - more on that in a later post. 
 I was one month in to a new job which I love. I now work in retail, a wish of mine came true to be able to work with what is my passion -  clothes.  Endless amount of clothes have been bought with personal discounts but I'm not complaining, I just have to keep my spending spree in check. 
 Throughout the summer I worked a lot which was just what I wanted after being home for such a long time with my son. I was also able to enjoy our hot Norwegian summer, and I actually mean  hot.  Never before have we Scandinavians had such a tropical weather. My mum and I were also in Italy which I will share with you in my coming posts. 
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
 That was a bit of a summer update for you even though we're well into fall now, it being the beginning of October and all. 
 New memories are being created and a new chapter is upon us. I can’t wait to share my adventures with you again. I promise, it won't be long until you hear from me again.

 Monday 
 The last couple of days have been so crazy. It all started on Monday where I had a chill day with my son until he fell into an accident. I got so overwhelmed and guilty that I couldn't protect him. Luckily his bruises are almost healed and he was back on his feet in no time. 
 Tuesday 
 Tuesday I got an email about a phone interview I had Friday morning, just when I thought there was no hope left. 
 Wednesday 
 On Wednesday I had to bring my car into the repair shop so that I could continue on driving it the next 2 years. That meant waking up at 6.30am, driving to the next town an hour later and then wait a whole day till the car was fixed. We did spend the morning having a hotel breakfast and continued on with shopping and a walk back home to my mums. Whilst my son was taking his afternoon nap which he had been procrastinating, I could finally breath out and relax. 
 Thursday 
 I got another interview call on Thursday which meant I got to meet my mum again so that she could watch my son. It went fairly well and we enjoyed an afternoon outside before we drove back home where I then colored her hair. 
 I actually got another call yesterday morning while I was at the health station with my son for his last baby vaccine. Another store wanted me in for an interview and we settled for today at 1pm. 
 Friday 
 Starting off today fairly early at 7.30am, I had breakfast and got ready for my first interview. Around noon I had to drive, yet again to my mums to pick her up so that she could watch my son while I went to my second interview. 
 It has literally felt like I’ve been running around everywhere and meeting so many new people in such a short amount of time. On top of that I have another interview on Monday at a clothing store which I’m super excited about. But first I have to take this weekend to rewind and unplug. My feet are killing me and I’m in desperate need of a lot of sleep. 
 Wish me luck!

 Oh, sweet silence - how I’ve missed you. I adore you when you finally arrive, even though you might not stay as long as I wish. 
 Today started off early as per usual, though I did get to sleep in yesterday which was deeply needed. I did some last minute editing before I took my son out for a walk. Don’t underestimate the power of breathing in fresh air and changing your scenery once every day. It’s good to change wallpaper and see beyond the four walls of your own home. And I’m happy to announce that I finally think spring is coming. Right now the rain is washing away the remains of winter and giving fuel to threes and flowers arriving soon. I can’t wait to walk out in a summer dress and enjoy the sweet summer air. 
 Today on the other hand I have some errands to run. I’m the best at procrastinating because I don’t like to face my tasks head on. But when I finally do get the courage to deliver those CV’s personally, make that phone call, or drive to that auto mobile shop to get my car fixed, I feel great. I still have 14 CV’s left on my kitchen table who seek a new owner and hopefully a new job for me. But for today the mission is to go down to the postal office and send away a package. Call the auto shop and get a price for my car and hopefully also an appointment. On top of that I need to place an order for some hair products. Much to do, and no time to waste. 
 **Hope you have a great start on your week! **

 A sick little child is fast asleep and I’m hoping and praying that my little boy will get well soon. Tiny bodies like his shouldn’t have to go through being sick three times in less than two months. Especially when his illness lasts a week or more. 
 All three of us have caught some sort of cold, one worse than the last. I even took a late night drive to the grocery store to buy lemons and ginger. If only I could be sick for him, but I know it doesn't work like that. 
 But I’ll always be a mother first no matter job I have or how old I get. Very reassuring in a way but with a great deal of responsibility. There’s nothing more comforting than to know that I can hold my baby boy and he’ll feel safe right in my arms.

 I can't believe it's already October and we only have a few months left of 2017. Where has the time gone? A question I ask myself every single day. 
 
 I've been pondering the last couple of days what to write but I couldnt find anything worth sharing. I've been working on my resume the last days and other then that I've just enjoyed being at home. I  have  to soak it all in before I go back to work, something I'm dreading but also looking forward to. 
 But this is my favorite time of year. Perfect weather and beautiful colors surrounding us.

 Today I took a day off work, just because. I don't feel the same drive and ambition towards my job and then it's no point for me to work even though I get paid. Because we depend on the income of our customers to get paid, there was really no point in going to work when I only had one client today. It's also nice to take a breather once in a while and recharge. 
 Ahead of me awaits breakfast, video editing and a job application. For some reason I always get nervous to personally deliver a CV, even though I talk to stranger every single day. The most important thing for me is to not think about it too much beforehand and remember that I've done this before. 
 Tips on submitting an application personally: 
 
 Dress in something you are comfortable in, but be presentable at the same time 
 Have all your papers ready. Most companies want to see a CV, certificate and diploma 
 Think ahead of what you want to say 
 Take x numbers of breaths 
 Greet the boss with a smile and a handshake 
 
 Whatever happens, happens. If it's ment to be you will be called in for an interview, if not, something better awaits you! 
 Comment below and let me know if you have any adding tips to the list above.

 What I dreamed about 
 What I dreamed about 
 08/03/201608/03/2016  by  mylifelizabeth  ♥  0 Leave a Comment 
 I used to dream about designing, styling or working at a magazine. I wanted people to feel great about themselves. I wanted to do that through clothes and fashion. Only  once  when I grew up did I say that I wanted to become a hairdressers. I remember it so well, but that dream faded as fast it came. I'm hurting my body while I'm doing something I never dreamed about becoming. Both mentally and physically. I have neck and shoulder pains, my hands dry up and hurt when they're too long in water. I've spend thousands on chiropractor appointments only to suffer through a job I don't even enjoy. 
 
 You are at the end of your teens when they ask you what you want to become. The time when you change your mind as fast as you changed your clothes. How can you know? And the dreams I had were unreachable. They are still so far away but so close to my heart. 
I had a young customer once asking me what I wanted to do if money wasn't a problem. He asked me if I wanted to do something different,  and I answered no . But I wanted to scream from the top of my lungs,  YES, I DO!  I do want to do something different with my life! I want to look forward going to work. I want to have my own clothing line, and design clothes for women. I want to be my own boss and I want to be great at it! 
 Is it really an unreachable dream? Can dreams really come true?
