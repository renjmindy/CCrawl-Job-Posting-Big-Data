  4 Truths I Have Learned from Career Transitioning  
 Deborah Shane 
 September 16, 2010 
 **** I am writing a book about my career transition in 2006, that is still unfolding and developing. Through this reflective process, I am seeing so clearly transition is always in motion even if you are in the same industry and company for a long time. When things outside of us change, we are changing too. Most times we are not even aware, unless it’s some tumultuous turn of events. I can remember being on such a high ride 1985-2000, while in broadcast radio. It was the best of times for business and our industry. It was fun, it worked for customers and clients and we all made money. Subtly, things started to transition and change internally and externally: commissions, procedures, cut backs, smaller budgets, management, the economy, technology. They affected all of us, but we trudged on. Transition to where it was going was already in motion. So, why don’t we pay attention to these early signs and shifts? I could feel the “winds of change” pick up. Gusts of wind started blowing through our company. I was caught in the draft. After 20 plus years in media and 9 at the same company, I sensed impending big change. I wanted to ignore it, but it was hard to ignore the “cheese was moving.” Who was I? Sniff, Scurry, Hem or Haw? At first I was Sniff-Hem. I was investigating other opportunities, but pining over that I was. Then, I became Sniff-Scurry and was eager to go out on my terms and find new cheese. I knew who moved my cheese!  I knew it was time to move on. I was ready for the next adventure in my life. Why can’t things stay the same I thought?  Because they can’t and they don’t.  I have learned to pay attention to and trust my instincts. When I announced I was leaving, people told me I was ‘out of my mind.' I smiled and said, "Maybe, but it’s going to change anyway.” It did, big time.  Enjoying this article? Here are 9 flawless reasons  to subscribe to our blog.   In looking back on this 4 year transition, I have learned 4 truths that have helped me keep the faith and keep going.  1. It’s never too late to transition.  [Vision]  2. Don’t be afraid of change.

[Perseverance]  What are some of the things you have learned during your transitions?  We are always transitioning  , even when we are stable. Flowing with transition and making good things come out of it is a highly valued skill these days.
