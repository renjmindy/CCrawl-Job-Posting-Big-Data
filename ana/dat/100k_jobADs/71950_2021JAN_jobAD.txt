 Are you looking for a high-profile, progressive opportunity, and the chance to leave your impact? I'm searching for a Production Manager for a highly reputable chemical manufacturer in Ripley. 
 My client is a global manufacturer, supplying speciality chemicals into a number of industries. I've known the Plant Manager for longer than I care to admit; he's an absolute diamond and he's looking for his second in command to help steer a period of strategic change. 
 Leading a small team, the Production Manager role has a wide remit to effect change across the facility, including manufacturing, engineering and quality, through the effective engagement of your workforce and your peers. You will set a vision and lead the team on a journey, transforming the site from solid performance to world-class. 
 I need a rounded manufacturing leader who, critically, has an engineering background - as a small team, your technical understanding will be critical to influencing bigger-picture change across the factory. Having progressed through Production or Process Engineering, you will have led a shop floor of 50 people or more delivering daily performance through interval management and the use of appropriate KPIs. Chemical manufacturing experience isn't necessary, a career in any fast-paced production environment is appropriate. 
 The successful candidate will be paid a salary of up to £55,000 plus car allowance and benefits; the Production Manager role is viewed as a natural successor to the Plant Manager, so genuine career progression is available to the right candidate. 
 Please apply or call Paul Strachan on 07725-844784 for a confidential discussion. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
