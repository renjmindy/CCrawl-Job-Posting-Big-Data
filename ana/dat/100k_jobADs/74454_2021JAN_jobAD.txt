 High-performing, transformational leader required to run a fast paced, pan-European freight operation based in Heathrow. 
 My client is a global third-party logistics business who are currently transforming their global freight division, focused on cost-improvement, efficiency gains and future-proofing for the growth/development of the organisation. Freight is a small division comparatively, with land, air and sea services working with predominantly industrial and manufacturing customers. 
 The European Operations Manager is a critical role in driving change in culture, defining processes and ensuring adherence throughout the organisation, providing a platform for future development and growth. You will lead the European Control Tower, responsible for the operation on a day to day basis through the effective leadership of a team of variable levels and capability. 
 You've had a progressive operational career in a global freight capacity within any sector - manufacturing, retail, ecommerce or any other - but most specifically, will demonstrate an understanding of world class global logistics services, a passion for continuous network development and the drive and tenacity to make rapid yet robust change. 
 Based at Heathrow, the successful candidate will receive a salary of approximately £65,000 plus a competitive benefits package. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
