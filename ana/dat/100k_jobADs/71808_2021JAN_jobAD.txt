 Workforce Wednesdays Virtual Career Expo 
 
 Workforce Solutions Rural Capital Area  (WSRCA) has launched a new Workforce Wednesdays Virtual Career Expo campaign within the nine-county Rural Capital Area of central Texas, to connect employers and job seekers at weekly online hiring events. 
 With a world-class labor force of more 520,000, and the unemployment rate continuing to decline across the region as employers begin to safely reopen amid COVID-19 concerns, Workforce Wednesdays represents a collective effort among Rural Capital Area communities and industries to empower their workforce through virtual interactive events, and continue to help the region compete at a global level. 
 “We are proud to continue to innovate our services to present new workforce opportunities for local businesses, families and job seekers,” said WSRCA CEO Paul Fletcher. “These are difficult times for our communities, but we’ll get through this together. By hosting virtual hiring events each week during Workforce Wednesdays, we are helping our fellow Texans find sustainable careers to support their families, all from the safety and convenience of their mobile device.” 
 Employers looking to host free hiring booths and interview sessions should email the WSRCA Business Services Team at  businessservices@ruralcapital.net , or visit  https://ruralcapitalarea.getyourbooth.com . 
 Job seekers looking to take part in upcoming hiring events can register through our events page:
