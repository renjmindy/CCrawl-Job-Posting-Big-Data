 Career Fair Connects Employers with Qualified Candidates in Faulkner County 
 On June 6, 2019, the Central Arkansas Workforce Development Area and its partners held a Career and Community Resource Fair at the Knight of Columbus Hall in Conway, Arkansas. 
 Serving as a platform to connect employer with job seekers, this one-day career fair offered multiple jobs and available services from 40 participating employers and organizations, including the Arkansas Division of Workforce Services, Arkansas Rehabilitation Services, Arkansas State Police, Cintas, Conway Police, Dillard’s, Faulkner County Sheriff’s Office, Kindred at Home, US Compounding, and Virco. 
 With 114 job seekers present at the event, all employers reported that they received qualified candidates for their job openings. 
 As a result of the successful event, the Central Arkansas Workforce Development area looks forward to their ongoing effort to connect local Arkansans to sustainable and gainful employment.
