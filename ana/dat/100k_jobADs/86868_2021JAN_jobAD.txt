 How Landit, a Workday Ventures Company, Is Redefining Career Development 
 Landit, a Workday Ventures software partner, helps companies invest and develop everyone from future leaders to undiscovered talent through its leading customized talent management tool.

 Redefining career development is a lofty goal, but it’s what a unique organization called Landit is accomplishing for its customers. The company, a  Workday Ventures  software partner, is a leading customized talent management tool designed to help companies invest and develop everyone from future leaders to undiscovered talent. Landit is led by Lisa Skeete Tatum, founder and CEO. 
 “We put the individual at the center, and then surround them with all the key elements they need—career support that would typically be reserved for the C-suite,” Tatum explains. She likes to describe her company’s mission as a “one-size-fits-one” solution at scale. 
 Workday Ventures has invested in Landit since its seed stage, and Workday is also a Landit customer. Together the two companies share a common mission of empowering employees to reach their full potential. 
 Recently, Tatum sat down with  Workday Chief Diversity Officer Carin Taylor  to expand on this mission, focusing specifically on what it means for underrepresented groups and how companies can support them.
