 Some places to find writing jobs 
 November 26, 2012November 26, 2012  /  Lisa J. Jackson (@lisajjackson) 
 I hope you had a great Thanksgiving holiday if you celebrated it last week, and that you survived shopping if you were brave enough to go out this weekend! 
 There are so many writing job resources and so many niches, that a comprehensive list is rare. We build our resources based on what we need to have and know. This list is a good start, at least, if you're in need of some places to start looking for writing opportunities. 
 
 Dan Case  's  Writing for Dollars  - a weekly e-newsletter jammed with legit paying markets 
 Angela Hoy  's  Writers Weekly  - resources for writers, including paying markets - and a quarterly 24-hour short story contest that is a lot of fun and offers numerous prizes. 
 WritersMarket.com  - related to  Writer's Digest Magazine  (which also has job opportunities), this online database has a lot of up-to-date markets. Subscription fee. 
 
 PayingWriterJobs - this Yahoo group has its worldwide subscribers posting the job opportunities, it's a community effort. From the site: 
 This is a mailing list for PAYING writer and editor jobs. It can be Freelance, Staff, Contract, or Permanent, but must PAY. No work for free or chit-chat allowed. This is primarily a network for writers and editors who are looking for work and editors who are looking for professional writers. This is a moderated list, which means the owner approves of all postings. 
 
 
 On  Twitter , you can find various job listing folks to follow such as @writersjobs, @writingjobs @writing_jobs, @dnzwritingjobs, @writethismoment, @dnzcontentwrite, @freelanceWJ, @UOPX (University of Pheonix), @AnneWayman 
 Also on Twitter for writers and others: @workfreelancer, freelancejobz4u, @theonlinejobs, @careerbuilder, @AlisonDoyle 
 
 Craigslist  - Free listings for just about anything you can imagine. But for writers, you can search in your area, or anywhere in the world, under Gigs, Jobs, and Services. It isn't the best place to find decent writing jobs, but it's a great place to get new keyword search ideas. Postings that list rates and company names are more trustworthy than anonymous posts that require samples be submitted before payment is discussed. 
 When looking for writing work, search by area of interest, company you'd love to write for, your location, state/location, editor name, publication name, etc. 
 You can find writing jobs on  LinkedIn , too, by doing keyword searches or even searching by a particular company to see the openings. 
 The above are some resources I use and think they can get you jump started if you're looking for writing gigs. 
 Please add your go-to resources to help our writing community.

 Thank you so much! I just recently graduated university and i want to explore my creative writing side to see if i can make a career of it. but i have a questionâ€¦how do you get hired with only university credentials as most employers want someone with experience?

 Thanks for reading. You should have some writing experience from your university experience that you can use. And I would guess that you can get job assistance from the university, too. School's always have resources to help graduates. I'd start there.
