 Head of Education (Science Content) 
 MEL Science 
 London 
 Excellent salary 
 Did you love science at school? Are you a Scientist passionate about writing and teaching? If so, read on! 
 About Us 
 We're a fast growing VC backed EdTech company, improving science education world-wide Our pioneering products engage children into Science through combining hands-on experiments with interactive science simulations in VR/AR/3D, bringing science to life! 
 Based in London and Saint-Petersburg, and shipped to 50+ countries, MEL Science improves Science education with an innovative combination of VR (virtual reality) and hands-on experiments. Our products have gained significant positive recognition from the Royal Society of Chemistry, Science magazine, and the Wall Street Journal, among others. 
 We are looking for a very special senior hire as our Head of Education. This role is similar to that of Chief Editor but is also genuinely one of a kind, exclusive to MEL Science, and therefore requires someone uniquely qualified to oversee our content production and ensure it's integrity at all times. 
 About You 
 Our ideal candidate will have worked for a Popular Science media or Educational Media, be it digital, print or broadcasting. Your deep understanding of the Sciences will fuel your passion for our mission and objectives in changing the way Science is seen in Education. You'll have ideally also taught school-age children, and produced high quality Science curriculums. 
 You'll be incredibly strategic, a global thinker, innovative, knowledgeable and also detailed in your outlook. 
 You will work in close cooperation with Product managers of the particular product lines to ensure their ideas are presented in a form of content which can be consumed by children of a particular age group (our products target different age ranges from 5 to 20). This content should also be interesting for parents! 
 **More About The Role:  ** 
 
 Overall management of all written and graphic content that is produced in our products and materials. Our own video studio will help to bring ideas of video content into reality and VR tech will provide access to the world-class simulation of the processes occurring in nature. We're able to translate our products to multiple languages, already totaling 6. 
 Our team of science writers, editors, designers and teachers will work under your leadership. The team totals 10+ people, hopefully expanding up to 30 in the upcoming years. 
 You'll ensure that the content is engaging, accurate, accessible and above all, geared towards education. 
 You'll liaise cross-functionally with our R&D and Product teams to ensure that a coherence and tone of voice across our materials is established and adhered to. 
 Organize curriculum alignments for existing products 
 Organize customer interviews, feedback sessions and surveys regarding educational content. 
 Maintain a consistently high standard of all assets that we produce. 
 Managing remote teams across the globe 
 
 More About You 
 As well as your background mentioned above, you'll also have the following: 
 
 Strong proficiency in editorial, creation of content 
 Ideally, you'll have some knowledge of Science curriculums in the UK, USA and China, or at least two out of three regions! 
 Experience in science popularization or teaching in school (better - both) 
 You understand how children think and consume new knowledge in a modern world. 
 A strategic mindset, you'll enjoy detail but also be able to see the bigger picture and deliver to long-term objectives. 
 Notable leadership experience. You'll be able to effectively manage and guide the team. 
 An understanding and experience with education systems of the USA, England and China (the more the better) 
 Extremely strong written and verbal communication skills in English. Whilst you may not currently be located in the UK, you'll be happy to relocate potentially and become one of our talented and driven team in London. 
 
 We are extremely excited about this opportunity and we'd love to hear from you if you think you fit our description. Please send supporting information and a CV through to us, telling us why you'd be right for MEL Science. 
 **Why should you work for us?  ** 
 We are looking to revolutionise Science education globally. To do this, we've gathered a remarkable team, both in St Petersburg and London. 
 We only hire the most talented of people, hence we also offer an excellent salary, enthusiastic, smart, positive, expert, passionate, and engaged co-workers
