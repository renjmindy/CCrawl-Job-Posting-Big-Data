 The Piano Guys  are an American musical group consisting of  Jon Schmidt ,  Steven Sharp Nelson , Paul Anderson, and Al van der Beek. 
 _They gained popularity through YouTube , where they posted piano and cello renditions of popular songs and classical music. Schmidt and Nelson’s music is accompanied by professional-quality videos shot and edited by Paul Anderson. _ 
 Paul Anderson owned a piano shop in  St. George, Utah . He met musician Jon Schmidt as the latter walked in to ask if he could practice there for an upcoming concert. Months later, Paul Anderson and Tel Stewart (then just for fun) started making videos together with  Jon Schmidt . It was not too long after that they did their first collaboration with Jon Schmidt, Steven Sharp Nelson, and  Al Van Der Beek  as the studio and music technician. After the five of them started collaborating the group really started to take off, producing a music video each week and posting it to YouTube. 
 Success 
 Several of the group’s YouTube videos have over 20 million views, while all of them have over 750,000. As of February 2014, The Piano Guys’ YouTube channel has over 345 million total video views and about 2,500,000 subscribers. 
 “OUR VISION  IS TO CREATE  MUSIC  AND  VIDEOS  THAT INSPIRE & UPLIFT. 
 WHATEVER WE DO, WE PUT OUR HEART AND SOULS INTO EVERY NOTE AND FRAME.” 
 The Piano Guys 2  is the third  studio album  by American musical group  The Piano Guys . It was released on May 7, 2013, by Portrait (a division of  Sony Masterworks ). The album made its chart début at number 38 on the US  Billboard  200 . 
 The deluxe version of  The Piano Guys 2  comes with a  DVD  featuring 11  music videos . 
 Today we are featuring “Waterfall” from their second CD with a major record label.

 Jon Schmidt  (born 1966) is an  American   pianist  currently residing in  Bountiful, Utah . He describes his style as “ New Age   Classical .” He was born to German immigrants who acquainted him with the works of such composers as Beethoven, Mozart, and Chopin. He began songwriting at age 11. To date, he has released eight albums and seven piano books containing transcriptions of original arrangements. 
 _His work is often described as New Age music  with  pop  elements of  hook  and  melody . His works were also featured on sample discs for the  Iomega   Hipzip  Digital Audio Player with the pieces “Sacred Ground”, “All of Me”, and “Waterfall”. _ 
 His influences include Mannheim Steamroller ,  Billy Joel , and  Beethoven . 
 Steven Sharp Nelson  (born 1977) is a pioneer in “cello-percussion”—an alternative performance method that combines traditional, lyrical cello techniques with unconventional pizzicato and percussive technique. He was born and still resides in Salt Lake City, Utah. He began studying cello at age 8, percussion at age 12 and guitar at age 17. He has invented a new method of playing the cello that combines elements learned from each of these instruments. 
 _Nelson’s true cello career began when he was 15. He was recruited by Peter Breinholt to arrange string parts and perform with Breinholt’s band, Big Parade. Since then he has recorded on over 100 different albums ranging from folk & bluegrass to hip hop. _ 
 He has also made his way as a solo artist. His first album Sacred Cello (2006) was atop the Billboard Charts. He has since two more solo albums that have also received significant acclaim (Tender Mercies, 2008 and Christmas Cello, 2010). 
 Waterfall (Jon Schmidt Original) 
 ThePianoGuys 
 Published on Jun 13, 2012 
 Written when he was 17, "  Waterfall  " is like an old friend to Jon. It 
got him the cutest girl in his high school, made him the life of many 
parties, and has been a big hit with pianists and piano teachers 
alike. Jon says that in high school it was proof that chics dig even 
ugly guys with skills. 
This tune has significant 
meaning to Jon and all of us at ThePianoGuys because It played a 
pivotal role in convincing Jon to commit to a full-time career as a 
pianist. An earlier video of Waterfall was done as a pre-TPG 
experiment. This version is ThePianoGuys' official video release.

 I'm originally from Puerto Rico. I was born in Santurce and raised in Rio Piedras. I currently live in Florida - since 1999. I have a doctorate degree in Medicine; completed in 1976. My Internal Medicine specialty was completed in 1979. Worked for Puerto Rico's health system until 1985. At this time, I'm happily retired after working for the federal government for almost 28yrs. I also worked for the government of Puerto Rico from 1979 through 1985 .... for a total of almost 40 years as a physician. I want to offer any knowledge that I have to anyone "out there" who is interested. My views are liberal in almost every sense. My knowledge is "eclectic" - a bit of everything. Music and reading are my passion. Blogging has also become a very interesting endeavor. Metaphysical topics attract me. I'm interested in news - reporting human issues like injustice, discrimination and abuse - the "wrongly" affected. My intention is to bring this knowledge to an understandable level and to help anyone in need. I'm open to questions and will answer them to the best of my ability. Currently working on an enterprise whose main mission will be to bring peoples of all walks of life together. To be one .... since we ALL are ONE!! The future looks bright and promising!!!
