 15 Legitimate Data Entry Work at Home Jobs 
 Are you a fast typist? Do you like the idea of getting paid to type alpha and numeric keystrokes from home? If so, you may find that a career in data entry will fit your needs perfectly. In fact, before I started working from home, I used to work for the United States Postal Service typing in mailing address and zip codes that were feed to my computer screen that others had written that the scanner was unable to read at the Postal Office. The job was easy and the pay was good but getting it was difficult because you had to pass the Postal Exam. That was a few years ago when working from home was not as much of an option as it is today but now you can do this kind of work online and get paid just the same as you would if you were working outside to home commuting to your job.
