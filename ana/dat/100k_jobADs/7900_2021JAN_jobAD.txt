 About St. Bernard Economic Development Foundation 
 St. Bernard Economic Development Foundation (SBEDF) is the official economic development organization for St. Bernard Parish. SBEDF’s mission is to create and retain jobs, build prosperity, and improve quality of life for residents of St. Bernard Parish. SBEDF is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.  SBEDF facilitates economic growth aimed at strengthening core industries, growing new sectors and entrepreneurship, and developing future business leaders. SBEDF provides business concierge services to companies in various phases of development and offers business owners and investors expertise on local state, and federal tax incentives and financing options. SBEDF Values: SOLUTIONS.  Our work means nothing if it doesn’t make St. Bernard parish a better place for everyone. Big or small, the problems we solve for our business community, stakeholders and investors all contribute to making this parish a great place to live, work and play. BOLDNESS.  Our people are bullish on St. Bernard and know that progress requires a bias toward action. We’re not afraid to advocate for our people or our parish. EXCELLENCE.  Our team doesn’t leave any stone unturned, any boxes unchecked, and definitely doesn’t forget to cross Ts or dot Is. When it comes our work, we expect more of ourselves than our community does and always strive to exceed expectations. DIPLOMACY.  Our relationships are everything. In economic development, none of your work happens in a vacuum. We spend everyday collaborating with partners, sharing best practices, and supporting ancillary organizations and companies. FACTS.  We make data-driven decisions and put out information for the community that can be trusted. In everything we do, we aim to paint an accurate portrayal of the boundless opportunity booming downriver.
