 Forty-third day of work selfie

 I am just so in love with this colour.  This bright royal blue is my absolute favourite.  I bought this blazer when I was shopping with my friend at Forever 21 downtown on Robson street on St. Patrick's Day.  Yeah, while everyone else was out drinking in bars, we were out shopping for clothes.  Because that's what we do.  It was the day before my last day of work at my previous job and I thought I ought to buy some more professional looking clothing for my new job.  This blazer didn't have a price tag on it, but it turned out to be a decent price for a blazer.   I remember while we were there, my friend found a shirt that said "Leave me alone" and suggested I should wear it as a joke on my last day of work.  Unfortunately, they didn't have it in my size. 
 I got the black top at Sears at Richmond Centre before they closed down.  I think my dad actually bought it for me because he had a Sears card so he could get a discount.  My navy blue floral scarf is probably the best thing I ordered from Avon. 
 I got this necklace from Her Story Lockets when they had a booth set up at the PNE Marketplace last year.  You get to choose which charms you want to put inside the locket to create your own unique, personalized look.  I bought some for friends and family as well, because I think it's really neat idea and makes a cool gift for someone when you can use charms that reflect who they are.  Mine include shoes, shopping bags, a big sister heart, a camera, and my birthstone.  I wish I could find more items in this kind of blue.

 Fifth day of work selfie

 I decided to continue with some blue in my outfit on my fifth day of work. I don't know if Casual Fridays are a thing, but I like to keep it classy. After trying on this sweater in like ten different colours at Sears, I decided to get the blue one since it was the brightest of the options (RIP Sears, why are all these stores closing on me?). Not to be outshined by the sweater, the blue sparkly scarf is one of a few sparkly scarves that I purchased at a kiosk in Metrotown (I was Christmas shopping at the time and not supposed to be buying stuff for myself, but who could resist a bright and shiny new scarf?). One of my former coworkers told me that I should get some fish earrings to wear with the scarf since it reminds her of the ocean. The blue belt actually came with the dress from Dynamite that I wore the day before, but since I neglected to wear the belt that day, I decided to give it a chance with this outfit instead. The blue flower necklace which so nicely matches the sweater and the scarf was one of the necklaces I bought at the UBC student union building from one of the vendors. I pretty much bought the most blinged out stuff he had as my reward to myself for getting a new job. Last but not least, I got this little black dress from Ross during one of my trips to the States (I feel like I'm due for another one soon…Road trip anyone?). Now I wish I'd bought the sweater in more colours like I did with the scarf. So I could repeat this outfit with all the colours of the rainbow.

 First day of work selfie

 I started a new job a couple weeks ago. And I took a selfie that morning because I wanted to show off the new blazer that I bought. Vero Moda from Winners. I feel like the colour is perfect for spring and I love that it has zippered pockets. The blue dress I wore with it is from Costa Blanca, and the scarf is from Orb. I bought the green and gold necklace and the ring from a vendor in the student union building at UBC because I thought I should treat myself to some bling.  I decided to continue taking selfies everyday, mostly for Instagram, but also Facebook and Twitter. Since I've decided to try blogging again, why not also share them on WordPress?
