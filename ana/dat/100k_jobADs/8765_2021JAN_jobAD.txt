  Poll: Would You Recommend A Friend Just Because She Needs A Job?  
 Ariella Coombs 
 December 21, 2012 
 A friend of yours is desperate for work and heard that your company had an open position in your department. Although you know she really needs a  job  and has experience in the field, you don't think you could work with her. Not only that, but you don't think she would fit in with the group very well. So, would you  recommend a friend  for an open position in your company even if you knew they weren't a good fit for the position? Things to consider: 
 
 
 Your friend REALLY needs a job 
 You know you don't work well together 
 You're not sure if she would fit in with the office 
 It could ruin your friendship and/or damage your reputation with your employer 
 
 What would you do in this situation? Would you recommend your friend to your employer? Or would you try to brush it off somehow? Please take our poll and tell us what you think in the comment section below! [poll id="105"] Photo Credit:  Shutterstock
