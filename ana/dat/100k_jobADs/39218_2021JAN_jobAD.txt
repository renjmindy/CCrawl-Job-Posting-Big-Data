 Today is the 7th and final day of a career exploration class I've been facilitating. During this time, the participants have been learning about themselves; examining their skills, values, beliefs and then looking at possible jobs and careers that fit best. 
 For some, it's been a confirmation that the direction they're heading in is the right one for them at this time. For others, something new has emerged. There's a several that have actually had multiple occupations come up and that's left them with some decisions to make. Finally, there are 3 for whom the course has left their future unclear; they've yet to get the clarity and direction they'd hoped for on the first day. Failure? Absolutely not! 
 Now you might wonder about those last 3. After all, if they came with the expectation of gaining insight into a career they could pursue and that's yet to emerge, why not consider their time a bust? Fair enough. Well, you see it's not a question of these 3 finding no job that interests them, it's more a question of still deciding upon an occupation that will best bring them overall happiness; a combination of what they do well, peaks their passion and returns financial reward for their labour. 
 Everyone in the class has in my estimation, entirely invested themselves in the process; giving thought to the questions asked of them and completing a number of assessments with a sincere trust in the process. Having conducted this class many times over the course of my career, I can spot a special kind of person; the one that takes this career exploration seriously and pins their hopes on an outcome that they'll then find meaningful; and this class was full of this kind of person. 
 And so yesterday, as we came to one of the exercises that starts the process of narrowing down which direction to move in for each person, it hit one person particularly hard when they realized the clarity and direction they'd hoped for hasn't yet materialized. Tears came, and they removed themselves for a few minutes twice in order to collect themselves. If you think people on social assistance are lazy, unmotivated and are happy to sit back and not work, you'd have a very different view had you sat in on the group yesterday at this moment. 
 When tears come out, it's embarrassing for the person much of the time, but it's actually a clear sign of how much things matter. If the person didn't care; they'd just taken the class because they were made to or saw it as something to do for awhile, there'd be no tears because their was no emotional investment. Because the tears came out, that's a clear indication to me that this career / self exploration stuff matters; that the person still believes THEY matter. 
 We all have barriers to success. That's not a question but rather a statement. Whether we share them or keep them private, there are things that stand in our way; education we lack, skills that are rusty or not improved upon, experience that we lack, a criminal record we don't have the funds to erase, an inability to decide between very different jobs and careers. We might lack transportation, have child care issues, anxiety, low self-esteem, fear of making another poor choice and ending up in an unsatisfying job, perhaps a disability; physical or mental. 
 And as long as were talking barriers, most of us have more than one. In fact, some of us have multiple barriers and they are the invisible kind. While others look at us and can't see them immediately, they are so very real and huge to us that we feel everybody knows ours. Truth is, most other people are concerned with their own issues they don't really see the ones we feel are on display for all to see. 
 For those still struggling to gain some direction, the feelings can be so intense, they see themselves as a failure - again. With the pressure they may be under in the other parts of their lives, this they'd believed, would turn out better. Well, it will. Really, I believe this. There is no prescribed 7 day fix that a course magically promises everyone. On day 1, I actually warned people I wouldn't stand before them and tell them what they'd be. That is for everyone to find for themselves and while it may take 7 days for many, more time is needed for others. 
 What of you? Do you know where you're headed job-wise, career-wise? Are you satisfied with that direction? Are you confused, anxious, afraid of moving in the wrong direction so you put off making a decision altogether? 
 There's a cost to being indecisive and time passing will rob you of your current references, the benefits of your experience as your skills sit idle. Your confidence will ebb with a lengthening unemployed gap on your resume. And which is better for you, a job or a career? Both have value and both are the right choice depending on where you're at. 
 Knowing yourself better is a great start. Look at your assets; skills, experience, education, contacts, likes, dislikes, problem-solving and learning style, just to name a few things. Knowing who you are is a key. 
 Looking at jobs and careers that match and working through your barriers will get you where you want to be. 
 YOU matter.

 Why Do You Do What You Do? 
 Career advice ,  Employment Counselling ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  mental health ,  networking ,  philosophy ,  relationship building 
 Why? A simple question using only 3 letters and a question mark. In this case, the, 'why?' refers to whatever it is you do in your work or professional life. Of all the jobs and careers which exist in our world, why do you do what you do? 
 Some people don't think about this a great deal. They work at the job they do because it's a family business, it's what they went to school for, or it pays the bills. In some cases, there are those that don't want to think about why they do what they do because they aren't proud of their job, they feel trapped in a job they hate, or telling others what they do just opens up discussions they'd rather not have. 
 You know what I find extremely interesting? Almost all the people I interact with who have no job at all think a great deal about why they'd want or not want a certain job over others. Whatever job they focus on has to be fulfilling, bring a sense of security, tap into their creativity, offer opportunities for advancement or bring about positive changes in the lives of others. So why are so many who are out of work focused on the why of what they'd like to do moving forward, and yet many with jobs don't think a lot about the why of what they do once they've been in a job for a period? 
 I don't know where you are on the age timeline, but it doesn't matter as much as you think it might when it comes to figuring out what you want to do in one key respect. When you are considering various career or job options, if you don't fully know what a job entails, what the pros and cons experienced by the people who hold them at the moment are, or why the people working in those jobs love the work they do, there's one simple thing you can and should do; ask them. Simple really. 
 "So, Ahmed, why IT?" 
 "You obviously enjoy your job Dave, why is that?" 
 "Nancy, why did you first think this career would be right for you?" 
 You see it's not that hard to pose the question and you can come at it from a view different angles. Bottom line, you're still asking, "why?" You can go on of course to ask the other questions;  How  did you get started?/"  How  should I get started?" "  Who  helped you in the beginning?" "  What  are the qualities generally found in the people who succeed in this position?" "  Where  are the opportunities for tackling current issues?" "  When  would you suggest I apply?" 
 Now I suppose you might feel that you're being invasive; you know, asking something of someone you don't know at all or very well, why they do what they do. Is that the truth or is that actually a tactic of your own for avoiding asking because of your own comfort level? I tell you this, a lot of people would love to pause and remind themselves why they do what they do. Further, if they feel positively about the work they do and the impact they have, they would truly love to share that with someone (insert your name here!) who is genuinely interested. 
 As you'd be well aware, a great number of people change jobs and switch careers entirely over their lifetime. Want proof? Connect with a large number of people on LinkedIn and you'll get daily notifications inviting you to congratulate your connections who have started new positions. I get 2 or 3 a day - no exaggeration. People move and the question I wonder every time starts with why. "Why the move?" Why now?" 
 Of course sometimes the why turns out to be getting away from something that's turned sour, but the majority of the time it's for something the person perceives as a better fit. Again the question is why though? Better pay, a change of scenery, a fresh start, the infusion of energy brought about by a greater mental challenge? Why? 
 There are so many, 'why's?' in this piece, I'm reminded of young children who keep asking why this and why that, almost exasperating the adults around them with the never-ending series of why's that follow every answer. We can learn from them though because this is how young children make sense of things they are curious about and want to understand. Likewise, you and I might be just as curious to know why someone chose a career, why they've stayed for however long they have, why they might be thinking of a move, or why they made the change. It's how we can gather necessary information needed to make better informed decisions about our own career paths. 
 You objection is likely that you don't want to be viewed as the young child pestering people with questions to the point of exasperation. So don't pester. You should still ask politely and learn what you can about career choices, why people do what they do and why they find fulfillment in the jobs they hold. 
 The next piece in these lines of inquiry is to take that information learned and look at yourself. Why would this job, this company, etc., be right or perhaps not for you? 
 If you haven't thought about why you do what you do for a while, why is that?

 Stuck On What To Do; What To Be 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  mental health ,  philosophy 
 Still trying to figure out what your purpose in life is? You know, that ONE thing you were put here on Earth to do? This certainly is one of the big ones; one of those questions that has a lot of implications. 
 When asked how they'll know when they've found the right job or career, some reply, "I'll just know", while others will say, "It will just feel right." However, what if - and it's just a possibility of course - what if you were actually meant to dislike the job or career you're meant to do? What if you're supposed to struggle with it, fight against it, coming to appreciate the hard work involved, (mental or physical) required to do it well? What if in the end, it's all the effort that goes into the job that makes the work more meaningful? Maybe for these people, it would never have, "just felt right" in the beginning at all? 
 Of course to many people, they want to discover THE job; the one they were destined for. Here's something though to ponder… When we look back at history and talk of people of note, we in the present day brand these people for the occupations they held when they became famous. So we talk about Shakespeare the bard, Churchill the Prime Minister, Charlie Chaplin the actor or Roberta Bondar the astronaut. What we don't talk of is the job or jobs these same people held earlier in their lives. Why? Because those jobs were of less significance to the masses. Were Churchill a Newspaper Boy or Shakespeare a farmer for a stint, we neither know nor care. But isn't it true that the people they became were in fact shaped by who they once were? What they once did? 
 Take me for a current day example. Meet me as an Employment Counsellor and you might imagine this is all I've ever done. If I have a positive impact on you and you admire me for what I'm able to share with you or you appreciate my ability to support you as you move forward, you'll always recall me as Kelly Mitchell the Employment Counsellor. However, I've sold shoes, worked in a bowling alley, been a Cooperative and New Games Trainer, and more. Those weren't the jobs that made me a person of note in your own life; but I've been shaped by those jobs nonetheless. 
 The same is true of you. Wherever you ultimately end up, when you look back at your career or collection of jobs, you'll see value in all the things you've done that shaped you along the way. This includes the positive experiences and yes, the ones which at the time were hard to go through, didn't work out at all, or you performed well at but just had to change. We are all the sum of our experiences. 
 Trying to figure out what's next so that you move in the direction you were always destined to go in and finally, "get it together" may or may not be possible. It could be that yes, you've been sufficiently stimulated to move in a direction that will bring you satisfaction and fulfillment. If so, great for you! 
 On the other hand, you might still be in a period of flux; that is, a time of confusion and change. Maybe all this struggle you're having in trying to figure it out isn't over. This doesn't sound very encouraging or hopeful does it? I mean, if you've tried to figure it out for years and you feel no closer to doing so, what kind of hope or optimism can you have for the future? Will it always be a mental struggle to find that thing that makes you happy? 
 What if we accepted for a moment that there wasn't one thing and one thing only after all? What if there isn't just a single career that we were meant to do or someone we were meant to become? Maybe what's right for us, what we were destined to do all along is a collection of various jobs and different types of work. Perhaps it's a collection of experiences that taken together makes us the people we'll become. 
 So when I was happy selling shoes, maybe I was in the right job at the time, although it's not a good fit for me here in the present. For all I know, I might find that selling shoes is right for me in the future by the way. Maybe running my business for 16 years was the ideal thing for the Kelly of the 80's and 90's. But Kelly in 2018? I'm happy and stimulated being the best Employment Counsellor I can be. In fact, it's that whole collection of earlier jobs and work that benefits those I help in my current job! 
 Now you. YOU! Feeling anxiety and pressure - maybe even depression or that feeling of being paralyzed as you try to figure it out? Understandable - completely. You're feelings are valid. This is after all, one of the BIG ones - "What should I do?" 
 While you may not know yet what you should do, what is obvious is that it's NOT what you're currently doing. So if you're stuck and doing nothing, continuing to do nothing isn't going to get you closer to it. Do something. Act. Talk. Invest yourself. Work. Experience the value of experience.

 Finding The Right Fit 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  mental health ,  philosophy ,  relationship building 
 I meet a great many people who are dissatisfied with the jobs they have. I also listen to an equal number of people who are unemployed completely and stuck deciding what it is they really want to do. That great job or career that everyone else seems to have, continues to elude them. 
 When I do talk to people who are by their own definition successful and happy, I've generally noticed that they've found an occupation that combines three key elements; it pays them well, they're good at what they do and yes, they like what they do. 
 I'll bet you can easily bring to mind people you know - perhaps even yourself - who are good at what they do, enjoy the work but aren't paid sufficiently well in their opinion. Such people tend to look at other organizations where they might do similar work but be compensated better. Money may not be everything, but money does give the means to live life on one's own terms and without enough of it, there can be a gap between how one lives and how one wishes to. 
 Then there are people who are paid well and are good at what they do, but they hunger for work that is more challenging, more rewarding. The work has either never really satisfied them or they've come to want to do something more meaningful and rewarding. These people will often surprise those they know by quitting good paying jobs to pursue other interests, leaving co-workers shaking their heads and wondering. 
 Finally, there are those who are paid well, like what they do but they aren't good at it. A lot of the time they don't last long in the job before being let go, but if they are in positions of influence and seniority, they can last a surprisingly long time in an organization; perhaps even resulting in the organization shutting down in the extreme over mismanagement and bad decision-making. 
 When all three factors align; being paid well, enjoying the work and being good at what one does, it would seem the fit is right and it's this we call success. 
 Now while a lot of people I've shared this idea with like the simplicity of the above, I find it interesting of note that most immediately pose some variation of the same problem time and time again. "I'm still left needing help to figure out what it is I should do job-wise." 
 The two are related of course, but they are different; finding the right fit and finding the right job or career. Let me explain. As an Employment Counsellor, I like the work I do, I feel I'm paid well and I can say I'm good at what I do. Were I to pick up and move to another organization but in a similar role as an Employment Counsellor, I might get paid less, or find that the scope of my job changed significantly. Hence I might have the right job but the other factors changed; in this case compensation for my work or the real work I'd be doing. 
 This could be where a lot of people go wrong; both job seekers and those who help people find employment. We broadly state the functions and responsibilities of a job - saying a Nurse does this or that, a Carpenter does this kind of work, a Labourer on an assembly line performs this or that, but really the experience of any one of these people will be different from others in the same roles but in different organizations. 
 The Carpenter might find a great fit in a small, rural community doing precision craftwork, where his talents are highly sought out and another might be happier doing restoration work in large cities working on a team of restoration carpenters. The job title might be the same, but the work done might need very different skill requirements and the environment the work is done in might mean the difference between liking the job or not. This is a factor only the person can decide. 
 I have for years felt the best place to start a job search is in fact not to look around at jobs on a job board, but to look inside one's self. What makes you tick? That simple question requires a lot of thought and self-awareness. In other words, get to know yourself; your likes and dislikes, preferences for working alone or in groups and under what circumstances for each. Determine the work environment, the kind of supervision you need and want. Skills you can generally acquire and work to improve if you choose. Learning about yourself first isn't a waste of time or stalling your career development. It's putting yourself in a place to ultimately succeed as you've never succeeded in the past in finding the right fit. 
 The good news is that you can find the right fit by design or chance. The bad news is you can go through a lot of jobs and yes even careers attempting to find what's the right fit for you if you don't pay attention to learning about yourself first. 
 Maybe it's because we think we know ourselves well that we overlook the obvious; but it's been my experience we don't know ourselves as well as we assume. And over time, yes, we change and so do our preferences. 
 May you find the right fit for you.

 Must Work Be Meaningful? To Whom? 
 Job Search Advice 
 I wonder if you've ever been advised to find a line of work where you can really find a strong sense of meaning in the work you'll do? This advice typically is followed up with the promise that finding meaning in the work you'll do will make whatever you're doing rewarding; and in it being rewarding and meaningful, you'll enjoy it and life in general more. 
 It's not bad advice really. There are many people who'd agree, if for no other reason than we spend a lot of our waking hours at work, and as all those hours add up, we'd best all be doing something meaningful to justify the investment of time. 
 However, the downside of this advice is that there are many people who don't look to find meaning in the work they do, they just happily go in day in and day to work. Telling such people they'll be happier searching for work they find real meaning in doing might just result in giving them something to worry or stress about. And who is to say that the meaning you might derive from one job over another would be similarly felt by someone else; say your daughter or son? How many mothers or fathers have hoped that their children would follow in their footsteps and have the same career as themselves, only to have their children choose other lines of work? 
 If you're so inclined, you might realize too that people change. The job we found meaning in when we were 20 something might hold that meaning for 5 or so years, and then we suddenly realize one day that it's been awhile since we really felt it as truly rewarding and meaningful. If this is the case, how do we go about finding a career in our late teens and early 20's that we'll find genuinely meaningful for the next 45 or 50 years? 
 Well, don't fret about it. First of all it's highly probable and natural that as you become exposed to different jobs and careers over the course of your life, you'll find some of those jobs intriguing; perhaps enough to go after them. Changing jobs within our field is something many of us do, changing our field of interest entirely is also something not all that uncommon. It's called evolution; becoming exposed to something new, finding real interest in it, doing what it takes to qualify yourself and working a plan to one day be in that new role. 
 Yet, while it's natural then for many to want to do work that they find meaning in, is there anything wrong with doing work that one doesn't find meaningful? Do you know anyone who when asked why they do what they do replies, "It's a pay cheque"? I mean there has to be a number of people who are doing jobs quite competently; but for whom the concept of doing meaningful work isn't important. And because we are all so very different on this planet, it's impossible to take a career - any career - as an example of a job that no one finds meaning in. 
 You might think a Cashier, a Waiter/Waitress, Server etc. might not find any meaning in the work they do; that it's got to be just a job until a career comes along. You'd be wrong though. There are obviously more people than you'd guess who do find great meaning in these jobs, and what's more, their not deluding themselves; they see themselves as providing a service to others. Further, they wouldn't want it any other way. Maybe they could make more income doing other things, but perhaps they don't take home excessive worries and stresses that go with some jobs you'd tout as more meaningful. 
 Whose perspective are we talking about here anyhow? Yours or theirs? Projecting our own ideals and values onto others, saying that one job is more meaningful than another is something we should be careful of. When we tell our son or daughter that a Teacher's job is meaningful; more meaningful than say a Crossing Guards, we transfer our own value system. If they go on to be a Teacher we're happy. If however, they happily become a Crossing Guard and find meaning and happiness in that role, have we now sent that message that somehow their choice of career is a disappointment to us? Is that what we want or intended to do? 
 Conversely, if they get ulcers and migraines - growing old before their time - fighting with and climbing over others on the way to some career which robs them of much of their personal time; missing family occasions because of work, will we find it okay to console ourselves by saying, "but the work is meaningful and important." 
 Important… maybe that's it. Could it be that when we say find work that's meaningful, what we're really doing is saying, find work that's important, and then by association you'll be important too? If that's the case, what message are we sending if the work isn't important in our eyes? Do we really mean that they are only important if what they do is important? 
 So what's the goal? Find work that is meaningful and if so to whom? Happiness? Sufficient income? Security? Challenge and reward? There are a lot of different values we could and do place on jobs and the people who do them. Something to think about.

 Stuck On Picking A Career 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  interviewing ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  mental health ,  relationship building ,  social media 
 Sometimes we get stuck right? I mean, we have a vague idea of what it is we think we'd like, but as I say, it's a vague or general idea. This is when we say things such as,, "Well I'd like to work with animals," "I want to help people", or "I'm good with my hands." While these kind of statements are good starting places and represent an early first step in career decision-making, some people will get stuck moving beyond one of these broad sweeping statements. 
 While it might seem pretty common for people in their late teens and early 20's to be typically thinking about what to do career-wise and getting stuck, it can happen to anyone at any time. Take you . Uh huh, you. 
 Have you got one of those LinkedIn titles that says, "Open to new opportunities"? No? Maybe yours says, "Looking to make a difference!" or "Seeking new challenges." Ah, so you do have one of these or something close to one. Even after having read any of these three, the reader is still no closer to knowing what it is you want. This is because you don't either. Maybe you've even convinced yourself you're being deliberately vague so you keep your options open. Sure. I've seen a lot of resumes over the years that start with the same kind of statements; "Looking for an opportunity to use my skills and grow with the company". Even after having read that opening objective statement, the goal is still completely unknown. What a waste of 13 words on the résumé! 
 The problem however, is defining not just to the world, but to ourselves, what it is we want to do. If we could do that, then we could figure out the steps we need to take to move closer to our goal. We could for example figure out that we need a certain Diploma, Course or Degree and then happily invest the time and money to go pursue it; confidently knowing that we're on the right track and with every day getting closer to our ultimate employment goal. 
 However, isn't the real issue here that we don't often know - that is - YOU don't know what the end goal is? I mean, that's what makes the idea of school and its associated cost so intimidating right? I mean, sure going to school to get more knowledge is great but with no goal, what if we choose wrong? What if we end up spending thousands of dollars and 2 or 3 years of our life in school only to find that we don't really want to do whatever it is we're in school for by the time we graduate? That would definitely be a waste of time and money and we'd be no further ahead. Or so we've told ourselves over and over. 
 So you're paralyzed; stuck. Every day seems like spinning the same record around and around, trying to decide what to do? What to be? Look up the song, "Big Time Operator" by Keith Hampshire. Figure out this one thing and you're good to go. 
 Okay so let's see if we can't help out here. Start with giving yourself both the permission to get going and forgiveness if you get it wrong. Who told you that you have to get it right this time or your entire life is a failure? That's just not true. Work, for all its worth, is only one part of who you are; one part of what defines you. 
 To find a career, let me simplify things. First you need to be exposed to some possibilities and then you investigate them. You can gain exposure to careers a number of ways. Talk to people and ask them what they do, ask your local employment centre what careers are in demand, use the internet and search careers in your vague, generalized areas of choice. "Helping people careers", "Jobs with animals" or "Physical jobs", "Manual labour careers". You can also search what are called, "NOC CODES." National Occupation Classification codes. You can search by skills, or even an alphabetical listing and see what jobs exist; many you might be entirely unaware of. So these ideas give you exposure. 
 Now, having exposed yourself to more possibilities that might interest you, choose a few and start investigating. Before looking to see how much the job is in demand or how much it pays, you'll want to know if this is something that only sounds good or if it sounds good and in fact it interests you once you've done some research. 
 Find people in the roles you're considering and talk to them. Set up meetings, email them some questions, have some conversations. Learn what's good and bad, what skills and education are needed, how they got started and how they'd get started today if they were just beginning as things may have changed. Then ask them for the names of others you might talk to. 
 The more you learn, the more you'll feel the job is right for you or not. When you start getting enthusiastic about a job, look into education requirements, the labour market, where the opportunities are. Still interested? Feeling on the right track? That's because you are! But to get to this point, you have to get moving. 
 Remember how long you've been stuck where you are and know that continuing to do nothing won't move you forward.

 Thinking Career Change? 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  mental health ,  older workers ,  philosophy 
 Are you considering a major change in the kind of work you do? That's a good thing, whether you end up continuing to do what you've done for some time or yes, you do indeed choose to venture off in a new direction. The process of evaluating where you are and where you'd like to be, what you'd like to do is healthy. 
 Resist the urge to put down your feelings and musings about a new line of work or career change as a sign something is wrong. Acknowledging these feelings and doing some exploring of what you're feeling and where these feelings are coming from can be quite illuminating. 
 Typically, thoughts about a career move go through stages where we become aware of our feelings, then we might share these with a significant person or partner and then move to share with the rest of our immediate and extended family, friends, co-workers and employer that we're moving on. That is of course if we make that decision to move on at all. If after some time of reflection we choose to continue in what we're doing, then it's possible that we share our musings with no one whatsoever. The key here is to realize that mulling over a big career move can be a very private experience; we have full control over who knows what's going on in our thoughts. 
 There are a many reasons we might consider a drastic career move. Boredom, needing a new challenge, health concerns, being burned out, declining performance, aging, taking early retirement, a company buyout, relocating to another area, a lifestyle change are just some reasons that could prompt these thoughts. 
 "What could I do that would make use of my skills and that I'd enjoy doing?" Some version of this question is what you may be thinking yourself. Given where you live and where you are in your life, you might also entertain the notion of a return to school to stimulate your brain, acquire some new knowledge or hands-on skills which could take you in a completely different line of work. You may not even mind starting in an entry-level job in a new line of work and be quite content to do so, having no interest in moving up to greater responsibilities; something you might have felt you needed to do 20 or 25 years ago. 
 So the clock is ticking, days and month's are rolling past and you're looking ahead at Life with a capital 'L'. What do I want to do with the remaining time I've got with respect to my work life? We're not talking your time beyond complete retirement. We live with the assumption and belief we'll have some time of an undetermined length beyond the day we retire. So we're looking at the time between where you are now and say, 65 or 68 perhaps as a ballpark figure. How many years is this in your case? 
 Depending on the number you have after answering that question, you might have a few or many years. You might only have time for one career move or have several years meaning you could have a few career moves left to ponder. 
 Sometimes what's needed isn't a change in career at all, but rather, a change in employer. A fresh start bringing your accumulated skills, experience and education to a new employer. The attraction might be a start-up, where you're highly valued and your leadership and expertise is drawn on for guidance in some early period where the company is set on just establishing a reputation. Or conversely, a big organization is undergoing a thorough clear-cut; moving in a whole new direction, and the attraction to get on board is exciting. Another scenario is a big organization provides some stability and job security which appeals to you over the stress you feel in the fledgling organization you're with now. There are so many possible scenarios! 
 Your financial security - or lack of it - also plays a big part in what you can afford to do or not do. We should also acknowledge some people are risk-takers and gamblers and others less so, hence it's vital you have a clear and accurate picture of your financial status and know the risks you may be entertaining in making a move. Then again, what might you risk with your mental health by sticking with the status quo? 
 Some questions to ponder then… 
 Am I doing work that I find meaning in and is this important to me or not? 
 Am I secure in exploring other options, including reinventing myself? 
 Who other than myself, might my final decision to change careers impact? 
 What is the status of my financial health? 
 How comfortable am I dealing with uncertainty? For a move seldom if ever comes with guarantees of success. 
 Do I need to take time off my current job to explore these thoughts or am I able to give them their due while continuing in my present line of work? 
 What are my commitments ie. mortgage, children, spouse, credit repayments, loans etc. and what weight do I give these things in arriving at some decision? 
 Of course there are other questions to pose and you're welcome to throw in some of your own to the comment section below. If you've been through or are going through this process now, I urge you to share some of your thoughts.

 Re-Inventing Yourself? 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  mental health ,  older workers ,  philosophy ,  relationship building 
 Whether by choice or necessity, have you ever, or are you now in a place where you're re-inventing yourself? You know, moving in a completely new direction from what you've typically done work-wise in the past. Depending on your circumstances, this can be an exhilarating time of hope, possibilities and uncharted exploration, or it can be fraught with stress, desperation, anxiety and worry. 
 So, is it starting to sound like I'm speaking to you directly? There's actually a good chance that this resonates with you to some degree because all of us have times in our lives where we assume new roles. This is important to both hear and comprehend; all of us go through this. 
 It's true you know… becoming a teenager then an adult, being a parent or grandparent, the first job where we joined the ranks of the employed, leaving one job for another. There are all kinds of moments in our lives when we transitioned from one role to another. But somehow, changing your career at this particular time in your life seems markedly different from all those other transitions. This is magnified when you feel forced to make the change instead of initiating change out of a personal desire. 
 For a lot of folks, the anxiety is stirred up wondering what to actually do. It's like that year in high school where you had to make a decision on what you wanted to be when you grew up. As awkward as that period might have felt way back then, it pales in comparison to the present where you're no longer 17 or 18 years old with your entire work life in front of you. No, now you're looking at yourself and wondering, "what am I going to do at my age?" 
 For the men and women who have been in positions of labour their whole lives, this idea of needing a new vocation could be brought about because their bodies are no longer able to take the physical demands of their trade. While the body is refusing to do what it's always done, the brain is fully capable and stress is caused because the work they've done is only what they know. It's like laying bricks for 37 years and then the back and knees give out, so the Bricklayer struggles trying to figure out what else they could do. 
 Sometimes the body isn't the problem though. Sometimes the prevailing problem is of a mental rather than physical issue; the need to change careers is however just as valid. For many, there is still the notion - completely wrong in my opinion - that a mental health issue needs to be concealed, while a physical issue can be more easily shared and understood. So the person with two bad knees and a back issue gets empathy and understanding while the person with anxiety and depression draws more skepticism and doubt. As a result, some people hide their mental health challenges as long as they can, thereby making it difficult if not impossible to get the very support and help they need to move forward. 
 A good place to start when you have to re-invent yourself is taking stock of what you have on hand. Imagine yourself on a ship with your destination fully known and suddenly waking up one day to find yourself shipwrecked on an island. You need to survive so you take stock of what resources you have. You don't go off exploring your surroundings without first taking your bearings and assessing your needs and your resources. 
 Using that analogy, you've gone through - or are going through - the shock of an abrupt change in your work life. The future is going to be very different from your past and while you understand this on an intellectual level, you're at that crossroads trying to figure out in what direction to move. You're worried perhaps that with the limited time and resources you have available, you can't afford to just move in any old direction in case you choose wrong. If only you could look ahead and see the rewards and pitfalls in all directions and then decide. Life doesn't always work this way though; as you more than anyone has just found out because you didn't foresee where you are now in your future just a few years ago. 
 So take stock of your skills, experiences both paid and volunteer. What did you like and dislike about the work you've done in the past. What are you physically capable of and mentally able to take on? It may be that the very best thing you can do is give yourself the gift of a short break. Yes money might be tight but if you can free up funds for a short trip to somewhere you feel good in, you may do wonders for your mental health. 
 Getting a booklet on courses from a community college or university might enlighten you to jobs you haven't considered; and you might discover funding assistance at the same time to go back to school if you wish. 
 This crossroads you're in could be a blessing too. You've got time now to really think about what to do with your life; something some people who dislike their current jobs would envy you for. When you're ready, and definitely not before, reach out and share your thoughts with someone you who'll listen with an open mind. 
 All the very best as always!

 Looking For Work? 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  interviewing ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  mental health ,  older workers ,  philosophy ,  relationship building 
 Looking for a job or the next step in your career can be a stressful experience. While you may want a new position, you're not at all looking forward to the résumé writing, online applications, rejections, flat-out being ignored altogether when you apply for a job you really want and then of course the interview process. The rejection and ups and downs of the job search thing is frustrating, nerve-wracking and for what? A low-paying job doing something you'll dread, working for people who don't care about you but only how much they can wring out of you before you quit or your fired? 
 It doesn't have to be this way, nor should it. If this has been or is your experience, no wonder your desire to look for a new job is pretty weak. Let's look at some ideas to keep motivated during this search. 
 First of all it's a good idea - even if it seems completely obvious - to know why you want a new job. Are you burnt out in your current job, looking to put your recent education to use, looking for a part-time job to supplement your income or perhaps looking for a promotion? Knowing clearly why you want a new job is critical because in the moments when you feel frustrated and just want to chuck it in, you'll want to remind yourself why you started looking in the first place. 
 A successful job search is planned out just like any meaningful project. Whether it's building a house, running an ad campaign, raising funds for a charity or designing marketing materials, planning is critical. Too many people unfortunately start their job search randomly looking at employment websites. That shouldn't be your first step. 
 After you've determined why you want a new job, assess what you're starting with. Anyone starting a journey takes stock of their supplies and identifies both what they've got and what they'll need to acquire. In the case of a job search, what are your assets? Examine your education, past and current experience including paid and volunteer work. Objectively take stock of your job-specific and transferable skills, your financial resources and the extent you're willing to travel to work. 
 Now to decide what kind of work to actually pursue. Looking at that list of your assets, what jobs are you qualified for now? Do any of these jobs appeal to you? If so, great! If not, are you willing to invest time and money upgrading your education to acquire the academic qualifications you'll need to compete for the kind of jobs you might really want? This could involve some research with local College or University Guidance Counsellors to help you out. 
 By the way, if you feel you've got time and youth on your side, don't fret about finding the perfect job that checks off all your wants and desires. If you're light on experience, there's a lot of sense in doing a variety of jobs to help decide what brings you happiness; what you like and don't like. A variety of jobs gives you perspective, might even appeal to an employer if you place yourself later as having broad first-hand experience. So if you can't settle on THE job, relax and give yourself the green light to explore several jobs for say, the next 5 years. 
 Now what's important to you? Are you after job satisfaction, money, a certain kind of environment to work in or a job that involves travel? What do you imagine is the kind of boss you'll work best with? There are many factors that you should look at to find what's important to you and if you need help doing this, get yourself connected with a local Employment Coach, Employment Counsellor or Career Specialist. These are the people who can best help you look at the factors that will ultimately bring you happiness in the work you do. 
 So with some job or career loosely or firmly in mind, turn to looking at the organizations that have these kind of positions. Taking the time to see how they differ from each other, what they rank and value, the atmosphere they create for those that work there is time well spent. You don't want to find you love the job but loathe working in the atmosphere that surrounds it. 
 At this point you've got a career or job goal in mind that you're skills and experience align with, and you've identified one or more companies that you'd like to be a part of. Now is the time to look at applying. Just because there are no current postings doesn't mean there are no opportunities. Networking and initiating conversations with those who do what you want to do, work where you want to work and hire people like you is essential and often overlooked. Get known. 
 Once you're connected, keep focused. Sure go ahead and ask about opportunities but do seek advice on what you could be doing in the here and now to strengthen your chances when a position is advertised. Positioning yourself to succeed shows them your keen and gives you momentum when otherwise you'd feel stalled. 
 Whether your 25, 45 or 60, take stock of what you've got, what you want and why you want it. 
 The steps above will take some time to transition through; varying for each person. Skip a step as unnecessary and you might be looking for some time.

 "What Should I Do? What Should I Be?" 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  older workers ,  philosophy 
 Find yourself pondering the BIG question; "What do I want out of Life?" You know, trying to decide your purpose, your career goal; that 'thing' you were destined to do and be great at. I wonder if the answer doesn't lie so much in wondering what you want to get out of Life as it does in pondering what you're ready to put INTO your life. 
 A clever play on words? A change in philosophy? Maybe just some pseudo-psychological babble? Or perhaps - just perhaps mind - we're on to something here. Worth exploring before dismissing or embracing? Absolutely. 
 Some seem to have it all figured out don't they? I mean they fixed on their career goal as a child or young teenager and stuck to the plan. They went to school, graduated, started in an entry-level position and years later they are still energized in their work. They never really had to struggle with indecision, doubt or distraction. They stayed true to their goal and never wavered and it all turned out great. 
 Not everybody has that experience. For many, what to do with their life is a recurring theme. Time and time again they stand at a crossroads wondering what to do, which direction to go in, what might hold the answer to the their happiness. They move from job to job, stimulated with the new challenges each brings, but always finding themselves looking for another job; one that brings them something their current job lacks. Some live this way intentionally because it works for them. Nothing wrong with that if it works. 
 The most dangerous situation when pondering the big, "What is the meaning of my Life?" question, is putting living on hold to the point of paralysis. In other words, it's a good and healthy exercise to pause occasionally and check where you're going and if your current destination is still the right goal for you or not. However, stand fixed to a spot afraid to move for fear of making the wrong choice for too long and you can become immobilized while Time itself ticks on. 
 This then is the source of the pressure and stress for many isn't it? Sure it is. You hear it in statements like, "I'm not getting any younger you know", or "Time and tide wait for no man". The older we get the more we feel the pressure to have figured it out too. By the way, as it relates to figuring out what to do with Life: you've never been as old as you are at this precise moment in time. As each second and minute, day and week go by, you age and again you've never been that old before. So whether you're 29, 38, 49 or 62 you might just be wondering, "What should I be doing with my life?", or "What' my great plan?" and that's okay to ponder. It won't be the last time you think about it likely either. 
 Maybe as I said earlier, the key is thinking more about what you want to invest in Life; with the time you've got and the resources you have. If you're a people person and you find yourself infused with energy when you're helping or cooperating with others, it's likely you'll gain great satisfaction out of doing more of that kind of work. If you're positively stimulated and happiest when solving what others see as problems, perhaps investing yourself in honing your problem-solving skills is the key for you. So do you want to fix home plumbing issues, computer problems, work to discover a cure for a disease or solve mysteries of our universe? All problems to work on, but requiring very unique skills. 
 Very little in Life that has real meaning and really importance comes without a personal investment. Just as you can't take money out of a bank without investing your money in it first, you can't expect Life to dish out all the great things it has to offer unless you immerse yourself in it. 
 For some, this immersion means travel; see the world, broaden your horizon's. For others, it means go to school, improve and expand your mind. For you? Who knows? Maybe it's auditioning job after job in a variety of fields, determining what you like and like better until you arrive at whatever it is you'd like to do for a long time. You can always re-evaluate in the future what is right for you at that point too. No need to lay a fixed course for your next 75 years when you're 10 years old. 
 Ever notice how this same 'investing first' mentality gets passed over in other areas of life? You might hear one person ask another, "So what are you looking for in a spouse?" You rarely hear that person say, "So what are you ready to invest in a relationship?" The question you get asked or ask of yourself tends to direct the answer you give. "I want or expect" versus, "I'll give or invest…" 
 You get what you put in. Is that it? We're all different, looking for different outcomes, searching for what sparks our happiness. The good news I believe is that there is no single thing we were destined to alone; you've probably got what it takes to find meaning and fulfillment in many things in Life; your job(s) being just one of them. Thoughts?
