 Georgia Department of Labor Gets a Facelift 
 Sep 15 
 Posted by  gurnage 
 With Georgia's unemployment rate currently at 10.7% and rising, the  GA Department of Labor  is a very busy office indeed. 
 I learned that they have rebranded the state unemployment offices and now call them Career Centers. (I also picked up a few interesting job search tips from employment seminars that they are hosting.) 
 In the past, state unemployment offices were usually run down buildings where people would go to collect unemployment in a negative atmosphere. Since 1998,  State Labor Commissioner Michael Thurmond  had a vision to change the perception of these centers and improve communication how the DOL can help the unemployed reenter the workforce. 
 Georgia's centers have been revamped and rebranded as Career Centers. The buildings are bright new facilities with a computer lab, meeting rooms and many resources for job seekers and employers. There is a more positive atmosphere than in the past and the employees are helpful and positive. The DOL is offering job fairs and seminars in places like the Forsyth County library. As a result, Georgia has been ranked one of the top states for reentering its unemployed into the workforce. 
 The Georgia Department of Labor (GDOL) operates 53 electronically connected local Career Centers offering a wide range of services to both job seekers and employers. The Centers provide individuals seeking employment all the latest tools to find and keep that special job. Employers will find assistance in recruiting new employees including a national job listing network, applicant screening, and space in the centers to conduct testing and employment interviews. 
 In addition to offering tips, I have received a job search handbook that is very thorough and helpful called RePLACE Yourself. Here are the job search and resume writing tips from the GADOL Reemployment Seminars I have been attending: 
 How people are finding their jobs: 
 Internet search - 3% jobs found here 
Company web sites - 8% (and rising) 
Newspapers - 5% 
Staffing agencies, recruiters, libraries, churches, etc. - 15% 
GDOL - 1% 
 Networking - 80% of jobs filled are NEVER advertised. (Wow.) 
 So where should you spend most of your time on a job search? 
 Resume Writing 
 Write for the HR Manager 
 
 9 out of 10 resumes don't pass the first screener 
 Put specific job at the top of the resume - customize each one 
 Include keywords (industry, skills, qualifications, attitude) 
 
 Recommended books: 
 
 101 Best Resumes to Sell Yourself 
 2500 Keywords to Get you Hired 
 e-Resumes - The Best Way to Work the Internet 
 
 Survey - HR Managers look for 
 
 Job skills - 15% 
 Teamwork - 20% 
 Attitude - 65% 
 
 Resume Tips 
 
 Don't use improper email address for contact information (hotmama at hotmail.com) 
 Bold number and email address 
 Customize title of resume to job you are applying for at top center of page just under contact information 
 Just list jobs in the last 10-15 years unless it's relevant to the job you apply for 
 Don't put your year of graduation 
 
 Job search and other tips: 
 Indeed.com  - aggregate job search engine (use different keywords for job titles) 
11 Alive job search 
Order 250 free business cards from  VistaPrint  and just pay shipping. 
Network with everyone you are in contact with. 
Write thank you cards - get a pack at the Dollar Store. 
Get a memory stick and keep resume and work samples on it. 
 Other sites I have found while searching: 
 Jobfox.com - list resume free, show full profile, get text messages when company looks at your listing 
Visualcv.com - list resume and portfolio, share through social media 
Linkedin 
Twitter search
