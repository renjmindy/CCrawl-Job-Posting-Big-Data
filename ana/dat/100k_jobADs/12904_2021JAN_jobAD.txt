 My Personal Experience working for Lionbridge 
 I have worked for the Smart Crowd platform at Lionbridge and I really like the flexibility it offers me. Plus the fact, that I could literally take a break from it for months at a time, (if I need to) and come back to it and not be worried that I have lost my job. It did take me a few weeks after I signed up to be invited to work, but when I received the email invite, I got started right away. 
 I also enjoyed having control over how much I can earn. Having small school-aged children at home can sometimes be hectic, but Lionbridge is one of those jobs that I have stuck with over the years because it fits right into my lifestyle. I get to decide if I want to work 8 or 16 hours a week. If I want to work more, all I have to do is log in and start working whenever I am ready. No one, not even Lionbridge dictates when or how much I should work. That is a real blessing and welcome relief for my schedule. I never felt any pressure from this work at home company.

 Yes they do but you may have to check back at their website every couple of weeks or so to see if they have a listing for English workers in the US. Lionbridge constantly posts new work at home jobs openings but sometimes they fill up fast as well. I hope this helps.
