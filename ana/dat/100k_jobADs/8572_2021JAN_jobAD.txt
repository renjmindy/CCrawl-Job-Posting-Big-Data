 Do you thrive in hands-on role in a busy manufacturing environment? Can you balance the "roll your sleeves up" work with developing a strategy? 
 During an exciting period of change to set the business up for strategic expansion, my client is now searching for an experienced HSE Manager who will make an immediate impact on their management of HSE while also taking on strategic development of their culture, systems and processes. 
 This role will suit someone with a proven track record of implementing robust change in HSE behaviours and systems/processes, but specifically someone who will lead from the front in an action-oriented capacity to engage the workforce and deliver rapid results. You will be a strong influencer with good interpersonal and communication skills, utilising those around you to drive real improvement into operational processes. 
 This is a full-time, permanent position and the client are willing to interview and induct the role over video, where you will start from home getting a handle on current systems & processes. The successful candidate will receive a basic salary of approximately £45k plus car allowance and benefits. 
 Send me your CV or call Paul Strachan on 07725-844784 to discuss. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
