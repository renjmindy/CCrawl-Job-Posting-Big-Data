 Don't Sabotage Your Writing/Speaking Career 
 WordServe Water Cooler is pleased to host this excellent article by James N. Watkins. 
 Welcome, James! 
 I've been editing professionally since 1972. (Of course, I started when I was five!) I've seen just about everything: Cover letters that said, "God dictated this article to me. I don't even know what it means." Submissions from aliens: the extraterrestrial kind. Envelopes spray-painted gold, which I assume was intended to make them stand out from all the plain old white envelopes. Hand-written submissions on lined paper. And now in the age of word-processing with 400 fonts, submissions that look like ransom notes. 
 So, here are some ways to avoid sabotaging your writing/speaking career—in no particular order. 
 1. UNPROFESSIONAL EMAIL ADDRESS 
 If you're going to be a professional writer/speaker, you need a professional-sounding email address. Two of the worst I've seen:  snugglebunny77@yahoo.com  and—I'm not making this  up—wordwhore@hotmail.com . Even  yahoo.com ,  gmail.com , and  hotmail.com  strike this grumpy old editor as a bit unprofessional. Get a domain name and a host that will allow you to use that as your email address. For example, jim @  jameswatkins.com  actually goes to my yahoo account, but it's masked so all you see is the domain name. 
 2. UNPROFESSIONAL FACEBOOK AND TWITTER POSTS 
 You'll probably want a Facebook account for only your family and close friends and then one separate for your professional presence. 
 Your followers don't want to know what you're fixing for dinner unless you're writing gourmet cook books. And unless your brand is "Cat Whisperer," I don't want to see pictures of your adorable kitties. (And having more than five cats qualifies you as "crazy cat lady.") Make sure every post provides value to your readers and fits with your "brand" (See point 5). 
 3. NO WEB PRESENCE, UNPROFESSIONAL WEB PRESENCE 
 When your book proposal comes before the pub board, the first thing the editors and marketing minions do—who are surgically attached to their laptops and smart phones—is go to  google.com  and type in your name. If you don't show up, you don't exist! And if you don't exist, you don't get a contract. It is absolutely necessary that you have a Web site, blog, Facebook and Twitter accounts online. 
 But having no presence may be better than having an unprofessional presence! With WordPress.com and Blogger.com anyone can have a free blog (Web log). The bad news is many of templates offered don't appear to this grumpy old editor as professional: animated .gifs, cutesy art work, kitties, etc. etc. 
 Your Web presence is a determining factor in whether a publisher will give your proposal further consideration or a conference director will consider you as a speaker. Spend—no INVEST—in professional help in creating a professional-looking site. And make sure you have a professional edit the copy. 
 4. UNPROFESSIONAL BUSINESS CARDS 
 Just because you're a Christian writer doesn't mean your business cards and Web site must have a cross, dove, empty tomb or—if you're Charismatic—tongues of fire. Remember the KISS principle. Keep it simple, saints! 
 And including "Professional Writer" makes me suspect. Would you go to a "Professional Brain Surgeon"?! I don't think so! (What is he or she trying to prove?) 
 5. NOT BEING “BRANDED” 
 Ouch! That sounds painful, but "branding" is a buzz word in the business and publishing world. 
 Basically, branding is what readers and audiences expect when they see your name on a book cover or on a conference brochure. You can't be all things to all people, so do some soul-searching and discover your unique role in the writing/speaking arena. 
 My brand—for articles, books, Web site, speaking engagements, convenience store grand openings—is "Hope and Humor." ( www.hopeandhumor.org ). So whether I'm writing, speaking or blogging, people expect hope and humor. (So writing bloody murder mysteries would totally massacre—pun intended—my brand.) 
 What does your audience (or "tribe") expect? Be specific and then deliver on your brand. 
 6. “FREE” PUBLISHING THAT COSTS YOU 
 Services, like  www.lulu.com  and  www.createspace.com , offer free e-book and print-on-demand publishing services. (Everyone loves free!) You simply upload your Word document and post your homemade cover and you can have your book as an e-book on amazon in a few hours and your paperback or hardcover book on your doorstep within the week. And you only pay for the actual wholesale price of the books. What a deal. It is a deal IF and ONLY IF . . . 
 
 
 
 
 
 you have it professionally edited (and not by your English teacher cousin). If your online or in-print presence is filled with errors, it can ruin your writing career. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 you have your cover professionally designed (and not by your sister-in-law who happens to own Adobe Illustrator—unless she's working with it professionally.) An amateurish cover, again, can ruin your writing career—or at least book sales. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Please. Please. Please, take this warning to heart. I see so many "self-published" books that just scream AMATEUR! That  free  service can  cost  you your reputation. 
 And if you're investing your hard-earned money in one of the hundreds of self-publishers out there, please read these additional  warnings . (There are hundreds of self-publishers who are amateurs at best and scam artists at worst.) 
 7. HAVING A “REPUTATION” 
 Christian publishing is a relative small club. Editors meet regularly at conferences and professional meetings, and we talk about writers and speakers. Believe me, we know who the people are who committing professional suicide by being unprofessional, "high maintenance," telling off editors who don't appreciate their brilliant talent, missing deadlines and burning "bridges." And speakers with "prima donna" complexes by demanding special treatment also can sink under the weight of their bad reputations. 
 There are many more such as playing the God card: "God told me to write this." But seven sounds like a biblical number. And by being aware of these, you'll protect your good name as a writer/speaker.

 Excellent post! I finally reluctantly changed to a more professional email and blogname (my own name). Still working on changing that twitter name (@vikingwritergal) without losing all my followers…

 When you figure that out, Heather- let me know. I think a lot of people have that problem. Wondering if it is possible to do that.

 Excellent post. The point about how editors talk amongst themselves is SO true. They WILL observe your personal posts if you are their "friend" on Facebook even if they don't interact with you much. This highly-charged political season has, unfortunately, caused many writers to post statuses on Facebook that may have unwittingly harmed their writing career. Adamant or extreme theological positions can also be harmful to your career. Do not assume that all Christians in publishing agree with you, theologically or politically. There's a wide variety of views among editors in every publishing house, even if the "house" itself has certain slant in what they publish. Use discretion and if you do feel you must post a strong opinion, do so respectfully and be respectful of those who comment.

 Very good points, Becky. I had a marketing person at my publisher comment on a funny post about my girls. They ARE reading what you're putting out there.

 Love your point about email addresses. As an HR Director I see this all the time. People don't realize what they reveal about themselves right up front and often it means I won't go any further. My favorite - drinksfor fun@… applying for a job at an alcohol treatment center? I think I'll pass.

 Wow-- that is funny in a not really funny way. I'm glad you pointed it out.
