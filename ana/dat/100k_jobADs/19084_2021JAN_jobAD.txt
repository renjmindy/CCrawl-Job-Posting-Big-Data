 Reinventing the #resume (again) #JobHunt 
 I had a conversation today with a recruiter -- technically, it was an interview, but the way we spoke, it was more of a conversation between an agent (her) and a client (me) -- who gave me some advice regarding my resume. I came away from the conversation with a few insights, and I'd like to share those insights here.  This is not the first time I've written about resumes . I continually learn something new about them. 
 We left the conversation with her giving me a homework assignment: revamp my resume to incorporate what we had discussed. 
 Probably the biggest takeaway was to rethink how I was presenting my resume. I shouldn't have the mindset of a job seeker telling prospective employers to hire me. Rather, I needed to approach it as a marketer. I'm marketing a product. The product I'm marketing is me. 
 This mindset is important. When you're trying to present yourself to an employer, you feel a need to impress them with your extensive experience, everything you've done, and the many reasons why the employer should hire you. But if you're  marketing  yourself, the thought process shifts. Instead, you're advertising yourself and your skills. "Hire me! Here's why!" She told me that it's okay to not put everything on your resume -- not  lie  , mind you, but rather, not throw in the kitchen sink when putting your resume together. Just highlight the important selling points. If they want to know more,  they can refer to your LinkedIn profile  -- and maybe even call you in for an interview (which, of course, is the purpose of a resume). 
 I found this to be profound, because this is a point that I espouse as a technical writer, and yet I don't practice what I preach when it comes to my resume.  I am a believer in not necessarily including everything on a document . And yet it never occurred to me to apply my own technical writing skills to my own resume. Don't try to provide every little detail. If they're interested, they'll ask for more (and if they want more, they can look at my LinkedIn profile). 
 I mentioned ageism as a concern, and a possible reason as to why I haven't had a job nibble in seven months. (I believe ageism exists in the job hunt; it is illegal, but is nearly impossible to prove.) In the same vein of not needing to include everything, one of the takeaways was to only list positions for the past ten or so years. One of my concerns was that my experience before 2009 would likely reveal my age, but at the same time, it was all professionally relevant, and I didn't want to leave it off. She suggested an idea that had never occurred to me: list the jobs (employer and title), but leave off the dates. Just say "here's where I worked before 2009." Again, if an employer wants to know more about those positions, check out my LinkedIn. 
 As an afterthought, after I'd removed the dates from the older positions, I still had a potential age identifier on my resume: my educational experience included my dates of graduation. Sure enough, in my latest resume revamp, my graduation dates will be removed. Employers just need to know I have a Masters degree; they don't have to know when I got it. 
 The recruiter also asked me another question: what accomplishment at each position are you proudest of? I have to admit that that was a good question. She said that it was a question that should be asked for every listed position, and the answer for each was something that should be included on the resume. 
 I was told, be your own client. Market yourself. When it comes to marketing yourself, you're your own blind spot. Only when it was pointed out to me did I know that the blind spot was even there.
