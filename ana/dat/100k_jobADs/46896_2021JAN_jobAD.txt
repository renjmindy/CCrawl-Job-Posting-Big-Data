 I often tell people that finding work-at-home jobs is the easy part. The hard part is getting hired. 
 If you're doing what needs to be done to  find work at home jobs , but aren't getting hired, here are some possible reasons why and work at home job troubleshooting you can do to fix it. 
 1. You aren 't qualified. 
 I'm all for applying to work even if you don't meet all the requirements. Why? Because few people meet all the requirements of the job. But you must meet the important requirements. If the application says you need to have a specific number of years of experience or a degree, those are requirements that you probably can't get around. Don't waste your time applying to jobs in which you don't meet the fundamental requirements. 
 2. You don 't stand out from the crowd. 
 Competition for work is fierce. Every job you apply to can have hundreds even thousands of other applicants. If you don't stand out from all the other job applicants, you won't get hired. The best way to stand out to get a job, is to tailor your  work-at-home resume  or application to the specific job. Don't just submit a list of your skills and experience. Submit a resume that fits your skills and experience to the duties the employer wants. 
 3. You didn 't follow directions. 
 This is a no-brainer, and yet a common complaint among companies that need to hire help is that applicants don't follow the directions when submitting their resume. Usually, people don't follow directions as away to stand out from the crowd (number 2), but not following the instructions in the job post tells a potential employer that you don't follow directions. Who wants to hire someone that can't follow directions? Follow the directions and stand out by being the perfect hire for the job. 
 4. There 's too much competition. 
 You may actually be the perfect person for the job, but there are so many other applicants, your submission doesn't get reviewed. The best way to avoid this, is to apply to jobs as soon as possible after they are posted. That means you need to search for jobs on a regular basis. 
 5. Your application was lost. 
 I'm convinced that somewhere in the universe floats millions of lost emails and digital submissions that never made it to their destination. It is possible that your resume gets lost. In that case, it's okay to follow up to check that your submission was received, unless the job post says specifically not to reach out. 
 Finding and applying to jobs can be time consuming. Don't slow yourself down by falling into one of the problem areas listed above. You'll spend less time and be more effective in your job search if you're applying to jobs you're qualified for as soon as their posted, submitting a tailored resume, and following directions.
