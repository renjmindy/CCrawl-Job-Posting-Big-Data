 I Don't Want to Say Good-Bye: American Dreamer (1984) 
 Romantic Moment #5 
 American Dreamer (1984) 
 So one weekend, my roommate Elaine went home to visit her parents. When she came back to college, she brought back a bunch of things and movies. She started showing me the different films and telling me about them, stopping at  American Dreamer  , and said that we had to watch it-that I would love it. She told me it was like  Romancing the Stone  , but better. 
 What? 
 I was like, I love  Romancing the Stone . How could this be better? How could I possibly love it more? 
 Yeah right. 
 So we watched it. And I loved it! I watched it… 
 It is amazing! 
 Cathy Palmer is a bored housewife, dissatisfied with her life and marriage. Her husband pays no attention to her, doesn't romance her, and only cares about his work. 
 She spends her days in the romance thrillers starring the spy and detective Rebecca Ryan. 
 The author of the Rebecca Ryan series is having a contest in which anyone can write a Rebecca Ryan story and the best one will win a week trip to Paris. Cathy enters the contest and wins! 
 She wants her and her husband to go, but he refuses and forbids her to travel. They fight, but Cathy decides to go anyway. When she gets there, she gets hit by a car, and when she wakes up thinks she is Rebecca Ryan! 
 Something is not right. 
 She takes off, goes on a shopping spree, and heads to Rebecca Ryan's hotel. There she meets the author of the series' son, Alan McMan, who she believes to be Rebecca Ryan's sidekick Dimitri . She sets out to solve the "case" of who is trying to kill her, taking Alan along for the ride. The two get caught up in an actual mystery as they go to an embassy dinner, track down a political leader, get shot at, have to hide from sight, get in car chases, etc-trying to solve the crime. 
 Will Cathy ever gain her memory back? Will she and Alan survive this adventure? And will they solve this case of who is trying to kill them, before "the book ends"? 
 Most Romantic Moment: I Don 't Want to Say Goodbye 
 Spoiler Alert 
 So this comes near the end of the film. Alan and Cathy/Rebecca have gone on this wild adventure-with Cathy/Rebecca fainting and waking up to realize who she really is and what has happened-remembering everything. 
 She and Alan have a moment and it is time for them to separate, back to their daily lives. But even though this whole time he thought she was crazy, she had to drag him along, and all he wanted was for her to stop-he realizes how gray and lonely his life was before her and now he doesn't want their time to end. 
 
 Alan McMan:  [To Cathy]  I don't want to say good-bye 
 
 Swoon! 
 So romantic!
