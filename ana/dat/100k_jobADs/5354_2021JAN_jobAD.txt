 I grew up with a group of brilliant and strong women all around me, but they all struggled with something I think a lot of people deal with — they could not  negotiate . And neither could I. 
 My mother’s a professor with a science Ph.D. One grandma was a doctor in the 1940s. Her sister was as well. An aunt had been a dentist in the 1910s in Minsk. 
 My sister went from a fashion background to an MBA and business ownership and quickly learned the ropes. 
 I married a brilliant and strong woman who negotiates like second nature — and for pay, to great effect. The contrast, in some ways, could not be  stronger .  Click Here to Read Article …

 If you think that work is just about getting the job done well and within  deadlines , you better think twice. 
 Working is not just about what you do, but also how you get it done — these two ingredients combined make up your reputation. 
 And by now you must realize that reputation counts a lot in every kind of professional environment. 
 You'll get promoted not only on the basis of what you do, but also on how others perceive what you can do. 
 Your actions will be interpreted by everyone at your workplace, and at some point you'll need to decide what sort of  relationships  you'd like to develop at work. Would you rather be liked or respected? 
 Here are a few tips to help you deal with this issue and build a solid reputation in your field.  Click Here to Read Article …

 You’ll be spending a lot more time with your coworkers than usual, and this can make for some awkward situations. 
 The most awkward of all situations will likely be your away-from-the-office relationship with your boss. 
 It’s a tricky social landscape to navigate, and it may not be clear exactly how you should handle certain situations. Developing an  etiquette  code for yourself ahead of time will keep most surprises from popping up.  Click Here to Read Article …

 To nip this evil in the bud requires a little patience. Here are six ways you can deal with a micromanager.  Click Here to Read Article …
