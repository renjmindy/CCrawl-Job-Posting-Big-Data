 About the role 
 Firstbase.io is looking for an Executive Assistant to join our fully-remote, international team. 
 Firstbase.io is a VC-backed company (YCW21) dedicated to promoting business in the worldwide economy. We are helping founders launch in the US and access the greatest startup ecosystem on the planet. 
 As an Executive Assistant, you will support the CEO, COO, and the other functional components of the business. Each day will be different, so you should thrive in the unknown by staying flexible and succeed because you stay organized. 
 This position reports to the CEO and COO. There is definitely potential for this role to develop and evolve to include additional responsibilities. 
 You will be responsible for: 
 
 Small legal-related tasks for the business 
 Working on company-wide announcements and materials 
 Manage monthly partnership commission payouts 
 Support Sales/Support/Onboarding teams with miscellaneous tasks 
 Assist COO in managing employee payroll 
 Create and/or edit documentation for internal processes 
 Get involved with improving the remote culture 
 
 What we are looking for: 
 
 Self-starter 
 Team player seeking to contribute 
 Creative in solving problems with limited resources 
 Highly structured and organized in the midst of constant change 
 
 Note from the CEO: “We are a startup, so there’s not a lot of process in place. Things change quickly as the company grows. This is a perfect role for someone who wants to get into a startup to experience what managing an early-stage company is like — by working directly with the founder and the executive team.”
