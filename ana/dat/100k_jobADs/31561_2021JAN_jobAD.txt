 A refreshing look at jobs 
 Posted on  September 14, 2011  by   Seth 
 I much prefer  Phil's take  (HT:  Arnold Kling ) on jobs to  Megan McArdle's . 
 From Phil: 
 
 The same technology that is eliminating jobs also connects us and empowers us in ways unimaginable just a few years ago. Maybe what’s becoming obsolete is not  jobs  per se, but the idea that they are something that you simply  find. 
 Increasingly, perhaps, a job is something that we each have to create. We can’t count on someone else to create one for us. That model is disappearing. We have to carve something out for ourselves, something that the machines won’t immediately grab. 
 That sounds difficult, maybe even a little dangerous. We’re all comfortable with the idea of “finding” a job. We search for them; we hunt them; we land them. All of these images assume the job already exists. 
 But to create something new…what does that even mean? Do we all become entrepreneurs? (I think the answer to that question is yes, although many of us will have to learn to be entrepreneurs within existing organizations.) Ultimately, it means we have to find something useful to do, something so useful that others are willing to pay for it. 
 
 In other words, as my grandparents use to say,  go out make yourself useful to somebody .
