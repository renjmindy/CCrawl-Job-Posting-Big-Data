  Clarify Your Personal Career Values  
 Bud Bilanich 
 May 12, 2013 
 **Success Tweet: Clarify your personal career values. You values are your anchor. They ground you. They center you. They keep you focused on what’s important. **  Your  personal career values  are important for a number of reasons. They can help you determine the types of people with whom you want to spend your valuable time. Also, they can help you determine which company you want to join. Lastly, they can help you make decisions in ambiguous situations. This career success coach is a big believer in the power of personal values. Here is what I value. These values guide my life. They ground me and center me. They keep me focused on what’s important. 
 Common Sense 
 Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, “Nothing so astonishes men as common sense and plain dealing.” I agree. I help my career success coach clients figure out the common sense solution to creating the life and  career success  they want and deserve, and then to do the work it takes to apply their common sense. 
 Simplify The Complex 
 I believe all too often people make things more complex than they really are. I help my career success coach clients simplify the complex, and develop and implement common sense solutions to their problems and issues. 
 Optimism 
 I believe optimism is essential for anyone to grow and flourish. I live by the words in The Optimist Creed, and I share these words with my career success coach clients. If you would like a copy, go here:  www.budbilanich.com/optimist . 
 Human Potential 
 I believe we all can accomplish great things. I help my career success coach clients use applied common sense to achieve their full potential. 
 Value 
 My career success coach clients pay hard earned money for my services. I provide them with extraordinary value-added services in order to justify their faith in me. 
 Trust 
 My career success coach clients trust me. They openly discuss their hopes, fears, problems and opportunities with me. This trust is sacred. I will not violate it. 
 Individuality 
 All of my career success coach clients are unique individuals. I honor this uniqueness, I don’t sell one-size-fits-all coaching services. I am diligent about gaining a complete understanding of each individual’s unique needs as I begin working with him or her. 
 Hard Work 
 There are no shortcuts. I am willing to put in the time and effort necessary to succeed. I share this message with my career success coach clients. I encourage them to be true to themselves by being diligent in pursuing their career success goals and dreams. 
 The Power Of One 
 One person can make a difference. I do the work I do, because I believe I can make a difference - in the lives of my career success coach clients, and in the world. Those are my values. What are yours? The common sense career success coach point here is simple. Successful people live their lives by a set of well defined personal values. They follow the advice in Tweet 17 in  Success Tweets  :  "Clarify your personal values. Your values are your anchor. They ground you. They center you."  They keep you focused on what’s important. If you haven’t taken the time to clarify your personal values, you need to do so – the sooner the better. This is some of the best career advice I can give you. Clarifying your personal values will help you deal with the ambiguity and complexity the world throws at you.
