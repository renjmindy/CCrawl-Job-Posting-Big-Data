 Migrate your Cron and Windows Task Scheduler jobs to IBM Workload Automation in a few easy steps!

 ​Save time and headaches using the new IBM Workload Automation feature "Import definitions" which will allow you to automate the process of migrating your Cron and Windows Task Scheduler tasks to Workload Scheduler. 
 ​The new feature will help you in this process doing what Workload Automation does best: automating it! 
 The time where you had to manually convert all your Cron and Windows Task Scheduler definitions into IBM Workload Automation objects is over, releasing you from all the problems and effort spent trying to understand and map correctly all the tasks, triggers and actions. 
 You can use the  Dynamic Workload Console of IBM Workload Automation  to read Crontab files or Windows Task Scheduler tasks and convert them into IBM Workload Scheduler objects. The jobs are added to your workload with the same specifications as the original jobs. The job streams reflect the time definition of the Cron or Windows Task Scheduler commands. You can then modify, schedule, and monitor them together with all your other objects. Think of the advantages of controlling jobs from one central place and the possibility of scheduling jobs according to complex schedules. 
 You will just need to import the files from the new section we have created, make few easy choices about where to run your definitions, and that's all! Just by clicking the import button, your definitions will be automatically converted into IBM Workload Automation jobs, jobstreams and runcycles, that will perfom the exact same action you performed before, at the same exact time, but gaining all the power of IBM Workload Scheduler, with thousands of new useful  features. 
 Check out this video to understand how easy is to convert your definitions: 
 If you want to try this new feature, you can use the  IBM Workload Automation on Cloud  solution; take a look at the " What's new " section, which offers quick and easy explanations about all the new features. For on-premise customer, the "Import Definitions" feature is also available starting from version 9.3 fix pack.
