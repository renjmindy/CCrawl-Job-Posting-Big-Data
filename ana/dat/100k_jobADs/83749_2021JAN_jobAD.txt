 Learning as I age 
 Off to a new job 
 November 4, 2014   susieshy45 comfort zone ,  house wife 
 After about a year and half, I am going back to a formal desk job tomorrow. 
 What do I feel like now ? 
 To tell you the truth, the age of feeling excited about new things has passed. All I can think of now is how I am going to reach the place and come back on wintry days. Will my cat miss me ( he has been so used to having a house- mother)? 
 And I will not be here to receive my daughter when she comes back from school. This worries me a little. 
 Why am I going back to work if I am not excited about it ? For some reason, a break in the work history on the CV is not very good for a middle aged woman. ( I don't understand the logic of this but there it is). 
 And the money will be very useful of course. I could buy all the books I wanted, without borrowing money and I could have some degree of financial freedom. 
 I have been working even when I was off a day job. I worked at home, in the garden, looking after the cats, the kitchen and a did a lot of other housewifely chores,which will now remain status quo, till the weekend. 
 I learnt crochet and about yarn bombing. I started writing and also learning about writing. I have learnt quite a bit and am a fairly professional writer. So I feel confident enough to meet others and don't feel at all as though I have taken a break. 
 Nevertheless it will be a new day and a new life tomorrow. 
 What are the reasons women want to work ? Do they have second thoughts often and think of the life they might have had, had they chosen to remain home makers? Isn't a home maker's life satisfying enough? Doesn't she get the appreciation she deserves at home ?

 I'm not satisfied enough being a homemaker. I love it enough that I'm only willing to work part time, but I still need that me time. I've written about it before, but I'm the kind of person who won't schedule time for herself unless she has an outside obligation. So, even though it's work time, it's me time. Ha, I do have two part time jobs, though! 
 Good luck at your new job! I hope you enjoy it!

 Thank you April. I enjoyed being a singularly focused homemaker. Now I am still a homemaker but I have a day job too. Do you find time to exercise ?
