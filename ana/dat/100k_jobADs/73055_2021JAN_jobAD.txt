 Finding job Details 
 How can I find out more information on the job in Alabama? 
 Coleen, the working while RVing editor replies: 
 Are you referring to job postings in the newsletter? In each issue of the newsletter, after the list of jobs, there is live link that you can click on to take you to the website page that has the details of the jobs, You'll find info on a lot more jobs there, too. If you look in the newsletter, after the list of jobs, see where it says, "March Job Listings." You should be able to click that and it will take you there. (If it is some other month, then that month would be named instead of March.) 
 Or, do you mean the jobs listed on the blog? On the blog, we usually just list the headline of the jobs. At the end of the post, it has, "Permalink -- click for full blog post." Click on the word "Permalink" and it will take you to the page with the complete Help Wanted ad. 
 Each ad should contain all the details that we have about the job, along with the employer's contact information.

 Workers On Wheels is our website and newsletter about working while RVing -- working while living in a home on wheels. There are so many kinds of work to do while RVing and camping (what some campers call workcamping or work camping). We help RV workers -- whether snowbirds or full-time RVers -- find campground jobs, volunteer jobs, jobs with RV spaces, seasonal jobs, mobile employment, short-term paid employment, and other ways to earn an income and cut expenses while enjoying life in a recreational vehicle. Thanks for visiting our WOW website! ~ Jim, your Workers On Wheels editor, at work-for-RVers-and-campers.com
