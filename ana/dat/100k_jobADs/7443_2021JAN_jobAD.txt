 Are you looking for a fresh start in 2020? I've been tasked by my client to recruit a Demand Planner to join their team onsite and be heavily involved in making a difference to how they import their finished goods into the UK as per their sales forecast. 
 I'm currently recruiting for a leading FMCG brand with a rich history and an exciting future, based near Worcester. They produce a market-leading range of products and on the back of some restructuring within the business they are reenergising and growing. They have scaled back their offering through their retail networks and are concentrating on pushing more direct to consumer sales through e-commerce. 
 As the new Demand Planner, you would have a background within retail distribution or sales - you will need an analytical mindset to succeed here due to the dynamic and reactive nature of the sales forecasts. To succeed within the role, you will need to be good with numbers and interpreting data to analyse sales trends and where demand is likely to be after media campaigns. 
 The company are looking for an individual who takes pride in their work and who really cares about making a difference within the organisation. If you are looking to apply here then you will need a background from within retail distribution to understand the complexities of the role, this experience will be critical to understand the dynamic nature onsite. For the right candidate there is definitely future progression within the company… 
 The successful candidate will receive a salary of £27,000 to £32,000 plus bonus and benefits. Please apply with your CV, or for additional information or a confidential discussion, please call Phil Birch on 07970 211517. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
