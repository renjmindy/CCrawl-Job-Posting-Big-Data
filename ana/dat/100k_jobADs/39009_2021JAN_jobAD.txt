 BRAND NEW REQUIREMENT FOR CREDIT CONTROLLERS - unique working hours that mean you will NEVER be in rush hour traffic again!!!! 
 Perfect for people seeking a working day that can work around your life commitments. 
 I am seeking two experienced Credit Controllers for my client, to join an entirely new team to support the current finance function. They are a well-established Wolverhampton business, with a strong history in their sector. 
 These roles have been created due to a large overseas acquisition, and will be exciting additions to a vibrant and dynamic team of people. 
 Salary for these roles will range from £20-24k, depending on experience. 
 I would love to speak to people who are open to the unusual option of working a 7.5 hour day between 11am and 9pm. Immediate starts are on offer. 
 This is a great opportunity for a candidate with a passion for credit control, query resolution and complex reconciliations, ideally with experience in a deadline-driven environment. 
 Please call Jo Payne ASAP to discuss on 07813 608579 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
