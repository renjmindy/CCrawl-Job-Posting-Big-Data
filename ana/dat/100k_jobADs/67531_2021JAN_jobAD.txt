 Choosing A Career Path 
 Posted by  George Wonah  on  November 13, 2019 
 As interesting as it may sound, choosing a career path can be daunting as well as confusing for some people. 
 The endless ‘what ifs’ that accompany deciding which field to go for or against could sometimes be exasperating. However, choosing a career is one of the most important decisions any individual would have to make at some point in their lives. 
 To make the right decision, careful consideration and meticulous planning is required, especially if one desires to land the job of a lifetime. To help you chart a course, we have outlined several tips. 
 Tips for Choosing a career path: 
 1. Determine Your Skills 
According to Career Advisor, Shay Nolan, there is a four-stage model of competence that aids skills to determine a person’s skills. 
• Unconscious incompetence 
When a person does not know what they are good at, this is mostly, because they haven’t taken the time to evaluate their skills. 
• Unconscious competence 
They are good at something to the point that they almost do it on autopilot. There is also a danger that they can become complacent here. 
• Conscious incompetence 
They are not good at a particular thing and they know it! At the very least though, there is an awareness which can lead to skills development. 
• Conscious competence 
They know what to do, though it takes some effort. This is where they want to be as there is both competence and awareness. This means that a person’s skills require a lot of consideration if they are to make well-informed career decisions. Ask some key questions: 
What do I do really well? 
What areas for development do I have? 
What are the skills that I really enjoy using? 
The final question represents an excellent starting point in terms of looking at how a person’s skills can help to inform what career path they should consider. 
 2. Take Opportunities to Play the Field 
A footballer who remains on the bench will never make a mark. Do not shy away from seizing opportunities whenever they present themselves, do not hesitate to participate in  team-building  activities that require you to put your skills to use. 
 3. Aspire and Work to Reach Your Goal 
Dream big, have confidence in your ability and constantly put your skills to work. Set goals for yourself – daily, weekly, monthly and yearly goals and keep moving. 
 4. Seek  Career Contentment 
When you love your job and work with a reliable team, you are more innovative and productive, your level of confidence soars and you are filled with a sense of purpose because you know you are adding value. This feeling of contentment does wonder for your morale, you will hardly get tired or bored with your job, instead, you will find yourself constantly exploring innovative ways to better your performance and outdo yourself.
