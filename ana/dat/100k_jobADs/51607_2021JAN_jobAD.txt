 Job Description 
 I am looking for a Sales Agent whom I can train to become a manager and run your area within the next year. You will be required to learn our proven sales system and, as a manager, to help hire and train new agents. This area is a fast-growing market and I am looking for a strong team leader who is willing to put their heart and soul into their work. 
 This is a remote based sales position that has an incredible commission structure. We have a streamlined lead generation system which puts you in front of qualified buyers who have written back to us because they have a need for the product. 
 Our Philosophy 
 Our philosophy is to better our lives through bettering the lives of others. If you have a willingness to learn and are passionate about improving your current situation, you will be able to find tremendous success through our proven sales system and amazing team support. As long as you are willing to learn new skills and follow our system, you will not fail. You will be able to better your life through bettering the lives of your clients and your team! 
 If you consider yourself a self-driven person who is willing to do whatever it takes to improve your current situation and upgrade your life, please read on for a description of our lead generation system as well as what you can expect from this position. 
 Our Lead Generation System 
 Each week we mail thousands of letters to people who just bought or refinanced a home. Our letter states that we will pay off their mortgage in the event of their death or make the mortgage payments for them in case of a critical illness or disability. In exchange for this protection, the client pays a premium. At the end of the term, if the client is still alive, they will receive all their money back. 
 Those homeowners that are interested in getting this protection will personally fill out our mini-applications and mail them back to us, requesting us to call them to set an appointment and show them their options. There is no cold calling. Only those who have requested the information will be contacted. 
 I am looking for a field underwriter who will take these applications, call our clients, set an appointment, and make virtual appointments and help them pick out the best mortgage protection plan that fits their budget. Our full-time agents will sit with 8 to 15 families per week. Some of our agents start on a part-time basis and gradually move to full-time. 
 Commissions as a New Agent 
 Typically, commission on a mortgage protection product is about $1000 per family you protect. Our average full-time agent will sell 5 to 10 mortgage protection plans a week. In addition to mortgage protection, the main focus of our team is to use a selection of premium financial products to help people save for retirement or protect their current retirement accounts (e.g., 401k's and IRA's) from losing money in the market. These products have very high commissions and can double your income. We have extensive training on how these products work and how to sell them. 
 What You Can Expect from this Position: 
 - Know that what you do helps protect the financial future of families 
- Benefit from a lead generation system that puts you in front of qualified buyers 
- Eliminate cold calling 
- Receive first-class training 
- Enjoy the support of your team 
- Enjoy a unique and positive company culture where leaders lead with their heart 
- Earn over $150K to $300K per year 
- Create passive income for life 
- Cultivate leadership qualities and achieve personal growth 
- Help others achieve the same financial freedom in their lives 
 Who I Expect to Hear From: 
 - Someone who has a deep desire to achieve greater things in their life 
- Someone who is ambitious and self-driven 
- Someone who is willing to learn new skills* 
- Someone who is willing to learn from others 
- Someone who has a desire to excel in everything he or she does 
- Someone who has an excellent work ethic and a high level of integrity 
- Someone who is passionate about helping others
