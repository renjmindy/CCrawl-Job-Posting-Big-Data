 In this  news article , Ravens rookie Kamalei Correa is quoted as saying this: 
 
 As a rookie, with my mindset, I'm coming in here, I'm not trying to overstep any veteran.  I'm just trying to do my job as best I can  and if these coaches feel like I am ready to run with the 1's, I'm going to do what they say. I'm trying to keep a job.

 In the sentence "I'm just trying to do my job  as  best I can," I wonder what exactly does "as" mean here? Normally, you would use "the" before the superlative such as "best", as in  I'm just trying to do my job  the  best I can. 
 Which sounds natural to my ears. 
 I notice that "as best" instead of "the best" is fairly common. Do they mean the same thing? If so, why use "as" instead of "the"?

 I prefer "the best" in that example. I don't know for sure, but people who use "as best" may be influenced by the structure of this similar phrase --  as well as I can .
