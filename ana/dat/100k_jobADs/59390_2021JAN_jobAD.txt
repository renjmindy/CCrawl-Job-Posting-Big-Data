 Procrastination unplugged 
 Standard 
 The Daily Post  asked me what my favorite procrastination destination was. 
Ah! The correct topic for me! No one in this world will ever procrastinate like I do. Even on the day before the exams! 
 My favorite procrastination destination, eh? Not at all something to think of for a good few minutes. The answer is right inside my head - wattpad! 
 My blog has just been added to the list recently. Before I started this blog, a site called ‚Äòwattpad‚Äô was the place where I spent most of my time. Now, however, both of these are on the priority list, so wattpad has been getting less attention from me than it did before. 
 Wattpad is a site where writers can connect with readers and publish their stuff online for free. Readers get to vote and comment on every chapter of your book that has been published there. There are also communities, where chats and discussions are possible. 
 There are communities like ‚ÄòImprove your writing‚Äô, ‚ÄòThe cafe‚Äô, ‚ÄòMultimedia designs‚Äô,‚ÄôWattpad announcements‚Äô and one club for each genre. I like to wander into those clubs and look at the discussions! You‚Äôll find me there! 
 The time passes swiftly while I‚Äôm there. It‚Äôs almost like I stopped writing and started spending more time there. The time for me to use the online software ‚Äòwrite or die‚Äô has come! I don‚Äôt even know why I didn‚Äôt join nanowrimo this time! 
 That was actually because I thought I had a lot to prepare for my job interviews that I thought it would be unwise for me to register myself into nanowrimo. But it looks like I have done zero preparations as of now, and half of the month has elapsed! 
 So‚Ä¶ I guess I could say blogging has become my new procrastination destination, then! 
 There‚Äôs this interview I‚Äôve got on 18th, and if I get selected for the job, then I swear I‚Äôll join nanowrimo after 
that! I know it‚Äôll be too late for that‚Ä¶ Nevertheless‚Ä¶ I had just ten days or something left when I joined camp nanowrimo in April this year! It was fun! Exciting! I didn‚Äôt want to miss it this time, but I did! 
Though I didn‚Äôt complete any book, I had lots of fun! Writing with a deadline seems to make me procrastinate less and write more! So, I think I should do well in that interview, get selected, and join camp nanowrimo even though I‚Äôll have just a little over ten days to write! 
 There‚Äôs just a half month left! And I guess I‚Äôll have to wait till November again, if I want the  real  challenge. But I‚Äôm telling you, November is a month where hectic preparations for exams and project works will be going on, and I cannot afford my time for writing then. Mainly because we have to write 50k words, unlike the  camp nanowrimos  in Aprils and Julys!

 Hiring, hiring! 
 Standard 
 There might be many companies that come to my college this year. As I can see, everyone's expecting to get placed soon. So do I. 
 But I asked myself this question: which organization would make me feel like home? Which one is best for me? 
 And also, I asked myself this. "Where would I be able to fit in well?" "Where should I be placed to improve my skills further?" 
 Though I haven't got that answer yet, I still believe I'll end up in the right place, because, I know the interviewers will select me only if they think I'm good for their organization. 
 I also have a desire for not-so-formal clothes, which I'm not allowed to wear in college. So I googled about a few companies and found that some might allow on Fridays (better once a week than never). I just want to relieve myself from the traditional 'salwar kameez' for once, at the least. 
 But I have a great affinity towards converse, which I'm sure I'll have to spare for the 'outside work outings'. I'm sure I'd hang out with friends in the weekends, so why not? 
 And I also hope I write something and  publish  it someday. I always start something, but I don't finish it; a new idea pops into my mind even before I finish the current one that I'm working on. 
 And coming back to‚Ä¶ (look at the heading, please).. 
 Wonderful companies like Mu Sigma, TCS, Accenture, IBM and‚Ä¶ (am I missing something?)‚Ä¶ and many more companies that I'm not even eligible to participate in (like Paypal, Amazon, Microsoft, etc) are visiting my college again this year! 
 The thing is‚Ä¶ I am still (a teeny weeny bit) confused about which place to choose. I feel like going to a place that I've dreamed of going, but I know no one there. There's another awesome place where I have relatives (and also a couple of childhood friends), which happens to be my birthplace, but I really don't know if I want to go there. 
 I'm sure of one thing, though. I don't want to get settled in the place I live currently. üòõ I just want to move to a metropolitan city, but I'm not sure which one to choose. 
 These are the confusions and problems that come along with hiring. After all, deciding the place/organization where you're going to spend the next phase of your life isn't easy, is it? Even though you get to earn, you can't say you'll be happy however it turns out, will you? 
 And I need a friends circle that will be huge enough to keep me busy everyday with them. I love spending time with friends. I wish I get some like-minded people as my would-be colleagues. 
 Goodness me! I'm planning so far ahead! I don't even know if I'm going to get a job or not. (Well‚Ä¶ I do have confidence in myself, which is why I'm ranting so much), but there're always ifs and buts, right? 
 Okay‚Ä¶ I know I'll go on ranting, making this post even more intolerable for you to read, filling it with other personal expectations and worries. Don't worry, I'll stop it here. For now. üòÄ
