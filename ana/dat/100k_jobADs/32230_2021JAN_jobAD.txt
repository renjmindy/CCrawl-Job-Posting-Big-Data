 Finance Manager - 45 - 50k 
 Gleeson Recruitment Group are working with a growing retail organisation in Birmingham who are looking for a Finance Manager to join their growing team. The Finance Manager will have an initial focus on implementing new and improving current processes within the month end routine, and owning the management and statutory accounting ensure the accuracy and that all deadlines are met. 
 The business is based on the outskirts of Central Birmingham with easy access to the M6, and parking available on site. 
 Due to the size of the company currently, there is an opportunity for a hungry individual to identify other areas that need improvement and add a wealth of key achievements to their CV. This role will report into an ambitious and driven Financial Controller who is willing to offer as much exposure as someone can take on, with an aim of eventually taking on their role. The role could be a great fit for an accountant who wants to take on more ownership and start to develop managerial experience on the path to FC. 
 The environment is fast paced and will suit an individual who enjoys a busy workload and wants to understand what "the numbers" mean and is keen to provide recommendations on how to improve. Internal and external relationships will need to be developed to ensure projects are financially viable. 
 Package on offer: 
 
 45 - 50k 
 flexible working hours (doors close to 5:30, so no one can stay longer). 
 Pension
