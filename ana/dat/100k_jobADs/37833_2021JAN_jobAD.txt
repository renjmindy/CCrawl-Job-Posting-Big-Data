 Job: Director of the Younes and Soraya Nazarian Center for Israel Studies, UCLA 
 Posted on  August 28, 2014  by   Aryeh 
 The UCLA International Institute seeks applications for a full-time faculty position in Israel Studies to serve as Director of the Younes and Soraya Nazarian Center for Israel Studies. A qualified candidate may also be appointed to the Rosalinde and Arthur Gilbert Foundation Endowed Chair in Israel Studies. The ideal candidate should hold a PhD, JD, MBA, MFA, or other appropriate terminal degree and be an outstanding scholar and teacher, an enterprising intellectual leader, and a collegial presence who forges collaborations with faculty and students across UCLA to further multidisciplinary research on Israel. There is a strong preference for candidates who are qualified for appointment to a tenured position at an appropriate level in any appropriate department and discipline. 
 Originally founded in 2005 as the UCLA Israel Studies Program, the Nazarian Center was established in 2010 as the first full-fledged Israel Studies center on the West Coast and one of three in the nation that are named and endowed. Located in Los Angeles, which boasts the second-largest Jewish and Israeli communities in the United States, the Center is a premier source of scholarship and education about Israel. Through a commitment to academic rigor and interdisciplinary approaches, the Nazarian Center fosters a broad understanding of Israel and its place in the region and the world. More information about the Center can be found here  http://web.international.ucla.edu/israel . 
 The UCLA International Institute, which houses the Nazarian Center, is the central hub for global and area studies at UCLA. Founded in 1958, the International Institute educates students, champions scholarship and builds academic partnerships here and abroad. Its more than 25 centers and programs promote innovative multidisciplinary research and educational opportunities in virtually every region of the world. More information about the UCLA International Institute can be found here  http://web.international.ucla.edu/institute/home . 
 Applicants should send a letter of interest, CV, research agenda, select relevant publications, and the names and contact information of three references  to UCLA Recruit:  https://recruit.apo.ucla.edu/apply/JPF00207  . Review of applications will begin  Sept 1, 2014  and continue until a candidate is selected. Salary is commensurate with experience. We encourage applications from women, minorities, and individuals with a history of mentoring under-represented minorities. UCLA is an affirmative action/equal opportunity employer with a strong institutional commitment to achieving and supporting diversity among its faculty, students, and staff.
