 job interview success followed by my first day of work 
 After a couple of okay interviews that didn't get me hired, and one  job interview fail , I finally met success. I was hired and I had my first actual day of work today. It is a retail job, at a medium sized store (I'm not going to say which one, so don't ask, thanks). Yesterday I went in for training for three hours and today I actually worked, stocking, starting at 5am this morning. Crap, that is early. But I was done by 10am, which is kind of cool. It is minimum wage, which is $9/hr here in California. That is not that cool, but I'm just happy to be working again, so I'll take it. 
 
 What do you mean I won't be paid in large bags of cash? What kind of job is this? 
 I don't have any funny story about my first day on the job. Maybe there is a way to put a humorous spin on it, but I'm too tired to think of what that might be. Just wanted to get that out there so you can move on to something else if you want. You don't have to read this. I mean that. 
 When I showed up this morning, I was told right away that some outside company had been there the night before and "done the floors" whatever that means. And that they had used some new product or process that had filled the store with fumes and due to the fact that the store doesn't have decent ventilation and we can't leave the front doors open when it is still dark out in the mornings (safety) we would just have to deal with it. But we were to let our MOD (manager on duty) know if we needed a breather. 
 A couple hours in, I developed a headache and mentioned it to the MOD and we all stepped outside together (safety, it was still dark) for a ten minute break to breathe some fresh air. Well, it helped in the moment, but not really overall. I had a terrible pounding headache for hours after I got off work today. NO fun. 
 The good news is that, so far, my coworkers seem nice and friendly and helpful. I hope that stays true as I get to know everyone better and longer. Good relationships with the people you work with can really make or break a job experience. Another good thing is that I get to wear a walkie talkie to communicate with the other team members. That could be fun, especially if I were still ten. 
 I pray this floors-getting-done thing is not a weekly problem, because I don't know if I'll be able to handle it if it is. And I really want to keep this job. I don't want to do any more job interviews. After finally nailing one, I'd like to just rest on my laurels for a while.

 Just found your blog love it; a little worried about those fumes you experienced and annoyed too that working conditions are still not really so wonderful in many places that we as public seem to think they are., keep writing ,you love it and I have heard somewhere that doing what you like most will eventually write one's pay checks , I do hope this happens for you soon , congrats on the 1000 followers that alone should alert many employers to your potential esp. as it was achieved in such a short space of time. If I was editor of a magazine for instance I would deffo employ you in order to increase readership and if that editor was experiencing falling numbers I feel they would be even more interested in someone who could put in the work like you did with your blog , just an idea , I also heard somewhere that when one has the passion for something it often helps to volunteer ones service for a short time , in other words don't give up the day job but put most of your energy into following one's dream I think , just would admire your achievements and really wish you tons of success in your life. 
 Happy Days and Kind regards Kathy.

 Thanks for sharing your thoughts and I am glad to hear you like the Honking Goose. ðŸ™‚ I think if there were anything in this general field that I would like to do it would be copy editing. I love to read and I like to find mistakes and correct them. Who knows? Maybe someday. I'm pretty happy at my new job right now.

 I am glad you found a job, there are a lot of people out there looking. You write your blog so well, that I thought maybe you did that for a living. A lot of my friends do. I hope you enjoy your work and the days get better.

 This writing stuff is hard work too, people deserve to be paid for it. I'm happy with the new job - so far, so good - and certainly relieved to no longer be looking.

 My sympathies about the fumes. That kind of thing gives me the worst headaches. I can totally imagine how you felt. But congrats on the new job! Welcome to retail where people are mostly nice but sometimes assholes and you get to smile and say thank you ðŸ™‚ but sounds like you already have the retail experience to know that one.

 Thanks, today was better. I think I'm going to like it, as far as jobs go. My previous retail experience was at a tiny, small town health food store. It was very different in a lot of ways. There were never any 'sales goals' or anything like that and it was always okay to stand around talking with my coworkers and the customers. I'm going to be missing that with this new job, I think. But I am very happy to be working again.

 Good for you! I hope that everything goes smoothly and that the ventilation problem gets figured out! Tell them to add some exhaust fans for worker safety. I agree with Melanie S.

 Thanks! It was much better today. I asked and the floors only get done every 6-7 weeks and it is usually not that bad. So I think it will be okay.

 5 AM??? ugh  I used to work for H&M for awhile and we had deliveries at 7 am. I used to hate it. It's a physical work and it is draining and the fact I had to get up in the morning made it even worse.

 It's cool to be done by 10am, but I am going to have to train myself to get to sleep early the night before.

 As a retail veteran, I could add a lot of points to your assessment, but I'll leave you with this: doing the floors always equals toxic nasty fumes. If the same situation happens a second time, do yourself and everyone else a favor and call to leave an anonymous report with OSHA. These fumes and other similar environmental hazards can leave humans with permanent lung damage. It happened to me. So please definitely take this very seriously. But do it quietly via the OSHA report so as to avoid being branded a "troublemaker" when you're new on the job. California has much stricter environmental laws than most of the country, so if it is this bad at your new workplace, I would venture a guess that the company isn't up to California standards. 
 And remember, retail is one of the few fields out there which has an abundance of openings, albeit most of them minimum wage and part-time, unbenefitted. If your concerns aren't taken seriously, get out and find a different one. I say this with over 20 years of retail and customer service behind me. I know how frustrating and sometimes intimidating it can be to have to go through rounds and rounds of interviews and to feel grateful for any place that says "you're hired." But some companies really don't concern themselves with anything but their bottom line, and will cut corners and sacrifice appropriate procedures and safety measures for the sake of the almighty Dollar. 
 Best of luck to you and I hope this ugly situation was a one-time thing!

 Thank you so much for that advice, and I will certainly take it. Making a anonymous report with OSHA sounds like a reasonable and safe way to handle the situation. Not only is the store not well ventilated enough, but it was still overwhelmed with fumes when the store opened and customers were coming in, including some with their children. It makes sense to file a report, for everyone's well-being. Thanks for your concern.

 It is really important! The place i worked where we had a similar problem there were multiple customer complaints and still regional management wouldn't do anything about it. I notice that over the years they have changed their protocol but that change wasn't implemented until long after i left the company. Your health isn't worth risking for any size paycheck, let alone a marginal one. (I wish i had taken this advice myself years ago.)
