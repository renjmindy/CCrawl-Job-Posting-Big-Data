 Assistant/Associate/Full Teaching Professor Masters programs including the Align MS in CS, Seattle, WA 
 About Northeastern: 
Founded in 1898, Northeastern is a global research university and the recognized leader in experience-driven lifelong learning. Our world-renowned experiential approach empowers our students, faculty, alumni, and partners to create impact far beyond the confines of discipline, degree, and campus. 
 Our locationsin Boston; Charlotte, North Carolina; London; Portland, Maine; San Francisco; Seattle; Silicon Valley; Toronto; Vancouver; and the Massachusetts communities of Burlington and Nahantare nodes in our growing global university system. Through this network, we expand opportunities for flexible, student-centered learning and collaborative, solutions-focused research. 
 Northeastern's comprehensive array of undergraduate and graduate programs in a variety of on-campus and online formatslead to degrees through the doctorate in nine colleges and schools. Among these, we offer more than 195 multi-discipline majors and degrees designed to prepare students for purposeful lives and careers. 
 About the Opportunity: 
The Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University invites applications for one or more positions at the rank of Assistant Teaching Professor/Associate Teaching Professor/Full Teaching Professor in the Professional Masters Programs and in the Align Program at Northeastern's Seattle campus beginning fall 2021. 
 Responsibilities: 
We are seeking highly-motivated individuals committed to excellence in teaching. Full-time appointments at all ranks are renewable, career-focused non-tenure-track positions with responsibilities in teaching and service. Opportunities for research and scholarship are possible with course releases to make time for scholarship. Primary responsibilities include teaching graduate courses at the MS-level and in the Align Program (see below for a description). We are searching across all areas of computer and data science. Classes primarily meet in the evening and are small, with 10-40 students in a section. Faculty are supported with TAs and graders. Successful candidates will create course content and materials, and collaborate closely with colleagues across all Northeastern University campuses (Boston, Charlotte, San Francisco, Seattle and Silicon Valley). Student advising and service to the college and university are an integral component of the position. Northeastern University is a global university recognized by our renowned co-op program and our focus on experiential learning. 
 The ALIGN bridges are designed for students from a variety of undergraduate backgrounds who need supplemental technical courses in order to matriculate into the Master of Science programs. ALIGN consists of four courses emphasizing the foundational knowledge and technical skills required for success in the respective Master of Science programs. 
 The Challenge 
 Women represent more than 50% of all bachelor's degree recipients but only 18% of CS graduates. Similarly, underrepresented minorities represent 25% of all bachelor's degree recipients but just 10% of CS graduates. By closing these gaps, we will not only address a major economic issue, but also a profound issue of social equity and inclusion. 
 Our Solution 
 The Align MS in CS program differs from typical MS in CS programs in several key ways. It is: 
 
 
 Designed for students who did not earn an undergraduate degree in CS 
 
 
 Coupled with Northeastern's famous co-op program to provide a paid 6-8 month work experience in one of the college's network of 500+ corporate partners 
 
 
 Taught at night year-round so students can keep up with other commitments and finish in 2.5 years 
 
 
 Offered locally at tech hubs across the country: Boston, Charlotte, San Francisco (opened in January 2019), Seattle, and Silicon Valley. 
 
 
 Our 5 year pilot to date has already demonstrated a graduation rate of 91%, with 100% employment and average salaries exceeding $100,000. Unlike code academies, our graduates are prepared for tech leadership career paths. Unlike undergraduate programs, the program takes only 2.5 years to complete. Most importantly, more than half of our graduates will be women and more than 25% will be underrepresented minorities. It is the ideal onramp for bringing a diversity of race, gender and thought to America's tech workforce. Across all campuses we currently have 560 students in the Align MS in CS, with Seattle being the Align program's original location. The Seattle campus is in the heart of South Lake Union, and in Computer Science we are growing rapidly, with currently 300 graduate students and projections to increase this significantly. Classes are held on campus in both day and evening timeslots, and we offer both the core Align program courses and a rich and growing collection of electives in software engineering, artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
 Please learn more about the Align program at our website,  https://align.khoury.northeastern.edu/ 
 Qualifications: 
Candidates must hold a PhD in Computer and/or Information Science or a related field from an accredited institution by the appointment start date. Demonstrated ability or potential for teaching excellence is required, but we will consider fresh PhDs. Rank of appointment at the Assistant Teaching Professor, Associate Teaching Professor, or Full Teaching Professor level will be determined on teaching/scholarly record and will be discussed with candidates during the interview process. Successful candidates will have demonstrated an expert grasp of knowledge of the field and be creative in their approach to teaching in an environment of experiential education. Strong written, oral and interpersonal skills are required in order to communicate effectively with diverse and exceptional students in person and online. Successful applicants are willing to teach in the evening and during summer sessions if appropriate. For more information about the College, please visit  http://www.khoury.northeastern.edu
