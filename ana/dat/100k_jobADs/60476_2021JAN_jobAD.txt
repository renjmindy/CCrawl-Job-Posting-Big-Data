  Poll: Weird or Brilliant Job Interview Tactic?  
 Ariella Coombs 
 July 06, 2012 
 Who would have thought a  job interview  was as easy as playing a video game? Well, now it is. According to Mashable.com, an Israeli ad agency is screening potential job candidates through the video game  Diablo 3 . If you're a programmer on the job hunt, perhaps you should look for "Yossilubaton#2572" on Wednesdays at 8:00 PM (Israeli time) this month. No need for a  resume , just bring your best game. Funny enough, playing the game with the potential employer seems like a great way to demonstrate your skills. No need for an employer to ask, "How well can you work under pressure?" when you can show him. (Not to mention, you have the chance to show off your quick and creative thinking  skills  when you take down the Skeleton King!) If you ace this test, you could be invited to an in-office interview. How cool is that? So, what do you think? Is this tactic just good marketing or is it a great idea as far as interviewing goes? Do you think it's time to move away from the traditional interview tactics? Or do you think this tactic is too informal? Check out the advertisement below, and then take our poll! Please let us know what you think in the comment section below.  [poll id="28"]  Job interview tactic image  from Bigstock
