 Allie Ward Senior QA Engineer, UK Hub 
 I'm a huge fan of diversity at Backbase. I love the freedom and ownership opportunities at work. I'm proud of the new solution that we are building. We had a simple idea and the solution that I've proposed is the one that we are working on.

 Patrick Newcombe Senior Full Stack Engineer, UK Hub 
 The biggest challenge I overcame with my team was creating an entirely new mobile product from scratch, aligning an entirely new team with people from very different backgrounds and creating a way of working which has the DNA of Backbase in it. 
 Harneek Singh Senior QA Engineer, EMEA Hub 
 Bringing a mobile-first approach to an industry with brick and mortar companies is not about the solutions or products you deliver but about that mentor-mentee relationship you develop with them along the way.

 BACKBASE IN UTRECHT 
  __Utrecht 
 The spring of 2019 marked the expansion of our footprint in the Netherlands. We opened a new office in the lively and prominent city of Utrecht. 
 Just minutes away from Utrecht Centraal Station, and located within a coworking space, our private office houses one of our business banking tribes, the F5. A close-knit team contributes its fair share to the development of Backbase products. With new roles opening here, the new location is on the rise. We wish to attract both local and international talent, putting our mark on the growing Utrecht tech scene. 
 #startupvibe 
 CULTURE 
 Small in numbers, for now, our Utrecht office has what you would call ‘a cool startup vibe’. We’re ten people in total, so literally everyone gets to share their ideas, whether in standups or at lunch. 
 Yes, the entire team eats lunch together in the most ‘gezellig’ of Backbase lunch venues. We organize ‘wine downs’ and cheese tastings to celebrate team milestones, life events, and just because… do you need a reason for wine and cheese? 
 lunch 
 Free, healthy lunches every day. 
 social 
 Drinks and snacks at the office. 
 fitness 
 Discounted gym membership through our corporate fitness plan.
