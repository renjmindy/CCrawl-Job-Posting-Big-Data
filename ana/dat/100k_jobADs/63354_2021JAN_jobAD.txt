 Toys appeal to children of all ages and, for many people, working with toys could be a dream job. One way to get a foot in the door of the toy industry is to apply for  Sales Toy Jobs  at local toy retailers. The following are a few tips for submitting an application for  toys r us express careers  and other retail positions. 
 Submit A Quality Resume 
 Most job applications today are submitted online, and they require the applicant to attach a resume, usually as a Word document. All resumes need to include up-to-date contact information, education, work history, and skills. People who have worked in a variety of different jobs should consider grouping jobs into categories like "sales positions,""managerial positions," etc., rather than simply listing them in chronological order. On the other hand, young people who do not have much work experience should list skills first and add volunteer activities. Resumes should be formatted so they are easy to read, and they should be proofread meticulously. 
 Research Salary 
 Job application forms often ask applicants to name their preferred salary. This is a delicate question. No one wants to work for less than they deserve but, at the same time, listing a high salary requirement could cause the hiring manager to toss out the application. The best way to come up with a reasonable salary request is to research the salary range for positions within the company or at competing companies. Often, this information is available on the company's website. If not, try looking up competitors or check the Department of Labor website for salary statistics. 
 Be Available 
 Unlike office jobs, retail sales positions usually require evening and weekend availability since those are the hours when customers shop. Promising maximum flexibility is one of the best ways to get considered for a job in retail toy sales. Retail sales can also be a great option for students or full-time employees who are looking for a side job, as there are usually part-time and seasonal positions available. 
 After submitting an application,  job seekers  can follow up with the hiring manager at the store after a couple of days. They should be sure to ask for the hiring manager by name.
