 Looking for an Editor of Journal articles for academia, Native Engl... 
 Published: 5 days ago  Bids: 1 
 Hi dear freelancers, 
 I thank you all beforehand for applying. 
I am the head of an editing and proofreading team, and I need some professional editors for proofreading and editing academic journal articles that are going to be sent to the best journals. The topics of these articles might differ from medicine, physics, engineering, philosophy, etc. So the freelancer needs to have experience with different texts. 
I need you to check the texts for punctuation, spelling, grammar, readability, vocabulary, etc. I also need the text to be checked by Grammarly Premium at the end of your editing, preferably. 
I know all of you applicants are great at your job, but just to make sure I can find the best editors I want for the team, I'm going to ask you to do a very small sample test for me and send it to me by your proposals. 
I am going to be available and I will answer each and every one of your proposals so you make sure you have a chance of getting seen. 
 This is going to be an on-going project, so keep that in mind. I considered $0.09 per word for this level of expert editing. Please send me your suggestions for the pay and I will definitely consider it. 
 Please edit this short paragraph in the attached file as a test using the Track Changes tool in Mircrosoft Word. 
Thank you all in advance.
