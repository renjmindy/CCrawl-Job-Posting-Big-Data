 Gleeson Recruitment Group are exclusively recruiting this permanent Marketing and Content Manager role based in Solihull. 
 My client is at an exciting period of its evolution, undergoing a period of sustained growth. This growth is both within the UK and across multiple international markets - with many more to come. Central to this growth is an effective marketing and content strategy, primarily through digital channels; this role will play a lead role on both defining and (importantly) delivering on this strategy. 
 The role will encompass the management (via team) and coordination of the following channels/outputs: 
 
 Organic Social 
 Content 
 Video production 
 Email marketing 
 PR 
 Advertising 
 
 The role will work closely with the senior leadership team and Performance Marketing team. The role will manage five direct reports. 
 The role will suit a candidate with strong  planning  and  coordination  skills, with a creative mindset. Moreover, the successful candidate will possess strong  reporting  skills. Finally, it is important that the successful candidate enjoys a hands-on approach to delivering marketing campaigns. 
 A background within health & beauty (or fitness and well-being) would be advantageous. 
 Highly competitive package.
