 JavaScript patterns 
 Gulp knowledge

 Relevant experience in a similar fast-paced agency environment

 Collaborating with your team of developers to achieve Devtopia 
 Translating high fidelity designs into fully responsive websites 
 Owning projects from start to finish 
 Collaborating with other developers on larger projects
