 Moreover, you will investigate existing datasets to accumulate relevant training data. 
 You will learn how to evaluate possible estimation techniques yielding 2D or 3D pose parameters. 
 You will support our team in building a prototypic demonstrator system. 
 
 ACHIEVE 
 
 You will build multiple scenario-dependent training datasets for deep learning. 
 You will develop a PyTorch-based algorithmic framework executing multiple detection & orientation/pose estimation schemes. 
 You will develop an adapted python-based tracking scheme building on top of the functionalities of the algorithmic framework. 
 You will evaluate and document test runs in pre-defined scenarios. 
 
 Your qualifications as an Ingenious Partner: 
 
 Ongoing master's studies in the field of computer science, software engineering, information and computer engineering, mathematics, robotics or similar
