 How Facebook Can Get You Fired - Infographic 
 Posted on  October 24, 2013  |  Leave a comment 
 We’ve all heard the horror stories about employees lashing out on social media about their jobs. This infographic shows how social media can carry heavy consequences for both employers and employees. 
 7 in 10 adults use social media, and the average person spends 15.5 hours per month on Facebook alone. This gives ample chances for employees and employers to create some large social media blunders-especially when 1 in 4 don’t manage their privacy settings.

 The Signs of Stressed and Overworked Employees - Infographic 
 
 Are you stressed at work? You’re not alone: A recent Gallup poll indicates that on-the-job pressure is the top reason for employee dissatisfaction in the American workforce, and nearly half of American workers say their job is “very or extremely stressful.” 
 And whether you notice it or not, you’re broadcasting clear signs that should indicate to your employer that you are overworked and need a change of pace. The infographic below, developed by Column Five in conjunction with employee wellness company Keas, shows exactly how employees behave when they’ve been pushed to their limits. Workers tend to develop classic symptoms when their workload gets too much to bear, such as poor memory, fatigue and bad time management.
