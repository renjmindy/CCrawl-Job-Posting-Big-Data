 $300 Payment for Full Time Virtual Assistant Job 
 I started working as a full time Virtual Assistant last October 14th,2010. I don't exactly know where the local employer got my resume because I forgot to ask,lol. All I remembered, I submitted it to several online job boards and she may have seen it in one of them. I was interviewed via Skype by the local agency and when I passed, she then hooked me up with the client. After an hour of interview, I got the job! 
 My client is a Chinese who migrated to US over 20 years ago. The job entails writing/rewriting/spinning articles which was all I did during this first month. Now I'm off to doing massive back links for all the sites we (my boss and I) created. 
 The trial period was from October 14 to November 14,2010. For the first month, I agreed that she'll give me $300 and if she likes my work, she'll increase it by the second month. 
 I'm so happy that I passed the trial month and here's my payment proof: 
 
 There was actually 2 Paypal transactions because the first time she sent the 300USD, I was billed for that particular transaction for $12. So, my client sent another $12 to make the payment in full. 
   
 The whole time I was doing this project, it never failed to cross my mind that the client might be a scammer. Thank God because at last I got paid! Just recently, I noticed that my relationship with my boss is getting better too,lol.. 
 I'm currently doing a post about Virtual Assistants, so please stay tune for that! 
 For the meantime, I need to relax and chill out a bit before I take on another big sideline project. I'll imagine myself spending time in the  Holiday Lodges in Cornwall . At least this way, my body and mind can relax though it's just an imagination,lol..

 girl, you have hyper promote pop ups, you might want to check your bidvertiser ad settings. 
 by the way, how many hours do you spend working as VA? I worked as VA before but I stopped as my boss was "bossy" heheheâ€¦ just not worth the time. i think it's really luck if you'll get good boss and a real one.
