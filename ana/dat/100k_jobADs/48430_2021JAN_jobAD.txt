 Tuesday Tidbits: Career Search Tips 
 May 26, 2015 
 Now that Memorial Day Weekend is done, it's time to launch back into the week! As many of you know, for me, this currently does not mean going to a 9-5 job. 
 The 1 year anniversary of graduating with my master's degree has come and gone, and I am still without employment in my field. Granted, a good portion of that time was dedicated to planning for and eventually executing a move away from Wyoming, and I haven't been idle the whole time! I've been doing freelance and volunteer work, both of which have grown my portfolio and helped me continue to fine tune my skills. 
 As I push on in my career search, I've come across some great advice in various places on the internet. I've also had plenty of opportunity to discover what absolutely does not work, and some things that do help on the job hunt. This week's Tuesday Tidbits post is dedicated to some awesome career search related content! 
 What I'm Loving This Week: Career Search Tips 
 → One of the biggest challenges I face before relocating was letting employers know that my out of state address wasn't going to be a hindrance, that I was ready to relocate, and I wanted this particular job.  Careerealism has a great post  on tips for achieving this. 
 → Unfortunately, in my job hunt, I've had a few major disappointments where I had awesome interviews, progressed until the last round of hiring, and then did not get the job. DailyWorth (one of my FAVORITE websites) has a  fantastic roundup  of why this happens. 
 → In order to build my network out here in Portland, I have been working on scheduling informational interviews with PR agencies and professionals in this area. My second one is tomorrow afternoon  has advice for setting these up. 
 → For my fellow PR young professionals - check out the  PRSA's entry-level employment center . 
 → Fellow blogger Bernandine has a recent post that really resonated with me. I've been feeling a bit hopeless about my career, and  her post  on remembering that this state is temporary was the boost I needed. 
 → And a little sweet kitty face never hurts morale, either:

 Yes! This post is perfect. I always wondered why I'd go through rounds of interviews & not get hired in the final stretch. :]

 I'm glad you enjoyed the post! It's such a frustrating feeling to not get the offer after so much work. It's actually kind of comforting to know that maybe it just went to an internal candidate instead.

 I recently changed my Facebook location to Portland, OR, and spend most of my time exploring my new place in the "weirdness" of PDX, enjoying my career as a PR girl, & experimenting in the kitchen. I've got a master's degree in PR and an obsession with digital. My great joys in life include food, tea, reading, working out, and finding new excuses to have a chocolate malt . <3
