  Appropriate to Put Picture on Resume for Certain Jobs?  
 Work It Daily 
 January 23, 2010 
 ‘JT & Dale Talk Jobs’ is the largest nationally syndicated career advice column in the country and can be found at  JTandDale.com .  **Dear J.T. & Dale: **I am starting to write my resume for a job hunt. I'm curious if a small picture of myself would be appropriate. The job is for Web design, and that might give the resume a little more personality. — Phoenix  J.T.:  A couple of years ago we were asked this question, and I advised against a picture. At the time, the HR world was very concerned about the legal ramifications of discrimination based on a photo — one HR manager had told me that her company policy was to not review any resume with a picture. Fast-forward to today, and all the social media tools have pictures. Still, it seems taboo to put it on a resume.  Dale:  However, the job is Web design. In the world of the Web, and in the world of design, giving in to the fear of breaking taboos is the biggest taboo.  J.T.:  The issue isn't just bureaucracy — the logic is that a resume is a fact-based document. So, how about a compromise: Use something like VisualCV.com to create an online resume, where you can showcase your work, include a photo, and there you can offer the personality that's missing from the standard resume.    Jeanine "J.T." Tanner O'Donnell  is a professional development specialist and founder of  CAREEREALISM.com .  Dale Dauten's  latest book is "(Great) Employees Only: How Gifted Bosses Hire and De-Hire Their Way to Success" (John Wiley & Sons).
