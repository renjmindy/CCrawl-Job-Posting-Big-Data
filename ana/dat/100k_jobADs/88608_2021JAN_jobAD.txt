 My name is Daniela Vargas and I am a young plastic artist currently working on the development of my own personal webpage. 
In principle I envisioned a very simple webpage that I could use for sharing my works and a little bit about myself as an artist. The descriptions of my works will include pictures and a short paragraph describing each of them which I will need to upload the different sections of the webpage. I have made some progress and already have a good draft of the project including a domain. 
However I need help from a good developer to finish this simple but very important project. Here the webpage in case you find this assignment of interest  www.danielavargasvictoria.com
