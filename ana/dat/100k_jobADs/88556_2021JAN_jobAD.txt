 Your Job May Be Killing You: Pack Your Travel Bags, It’s Time to Go

 BROOKLYN  (Workers World Today) - Yes, it’s time to go on vacation.  Some people believe that a vacation is a luxury.  However, it’s a necessity: this I learned from a reformed workaholic, Susie (name changed for privacy) after her doctor warned her, that her job was killing her. 
 At that time, Susie, a social work supervisor monitored a total of 60 families, who were involved in the child welfare system, and 6 full-time employees, thought it natural to work hard to ensure the safety of these children and families.  Furthermore, management encouraged supervisors to work extra hours, beyond the regular workday, so the staff would sense their commitment to their jobs. Therefore, it became common practice to work long hours at the office, take work home, and come in on weekends and/or holidays to get things done – until that day she’ll never forget. Although it happened more than a decade ago, she still remembers how the doctor looked her straight in the eyes and said, “Susie, I know you love your job, but your job is killing you.” There are some things that do not require repeating. That night, after returning home from the doctor’s office, she planned a vacation. It was the first of many great vacations that helped her to transform into a happier, healthier, and more productive person. 
 Here are just a few of the many benefits of taking a vacation: 
 Travel helps to reduce stress 
 Stress is a contributing factor in several of the major health problems affecting the community, including cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. Nothing melts away stress like a great vacation. Imagine relaxing in the lounge chair as your cruise ship is pulling into a fabulous Caribbean island of your choice.  There you will be greeted by friendly locals with the most delicious delicacies representing the culture of the island. Feel the stress melting away. 
 Travel helps to improve creativity and mental health 
 People can become stagnant when they have the same routine playing out in their minds repeatedly.  However, traveling to a new destination provides you with new and useful information that stimulates your thinking.   You discover a new way of viewing the world and are able to put things into perspective. When you step off the airplane in a different continent, the problem that once seemed humongous was merely a small nuisance that really isn’t important in the full scheme of things. 
 Travel helps you find time to plan and focus 
 Working extended hours without a break can actually make you weary, cause your mind to wander, and therefore, decreases overall productivity.  But you’ll have time to plan and focus when you’re lying on the beach, watching the waves go by. A great retreat does more to increase your effectiveness, than adding more hours to your workday. 
 Travel helps you strengthen bonds with family and loved ones 
 Cruises are the best type of vacation to take when you have several generations of the same family traveling together. There is something to do for people of all ages, at varying activity levels, on a cruise ship. Mom and Dad can go dancing, while the grandparents are enjoying a Broadway-style performance, and the teens are enjoying the water slide.  There’s plenty of time to catch up on the good days and make beautiful new memories with the people you care about most.
