  The Top 3 Soft Skills That Will Make You A Fierce Employee  
 Shivani Vyas 
 December 17, 2019 
 Technical skills, prestigious academic degrees, and resume experiences do not guarantee career success. In fact, there's a good reason why interviews take place—to test your soft skills. 
 
 Soft skills can actually make an employee irreplaceable (or at least hard to replace) at work. 
 Examples Of Soft Skills 
 
 Collaboration 
 Leadership 
 Positive Attitude 
 Teamwork 
 Problem-solving 
 Motivating 
 Negotiation 
 Mentoring 
 
 The Difference Between Soft Skills & Hard Skills 
 There is a concrete difference between soft and hard skills in the workplace. Both contribute to career success, but soft skills are often undervalued when compared to hard skills. Why? 
 People overlook the impact of soft skills, because they are viewed as less concrete or tangible. It's also easy to assume that every job candidate will automatically have them. 
 Example:  Imagine an executive-level professional who went to an Ivy League school and has 10 years of marketing experience under his or her belt. Now, during the interview, this same person displays traits like speaking poorly of previous employers or gives explanations that highlight job-hopping. 
 Would you work with someone who didn't value collaboration and lacks accountability? It doesn't matter where you stand in your workplace hierarchy, any bad egg in the bunch can stir up trouble for the entire team. So,  what  soft skills should you focus on, and  why ? 
 Top Soft Skills For Your Career 
 1. Personal Accountability 
 
 This one's pretty self-explanatory. You show up, get your work done, and will be responsible. 
 
 2. Collaboration 
 
 You work well with others, because what company runs on the work of one person? 
 
 3. Conflict Resolution 
 
 At any stage of your career, you have a solution-based mindset. You opt out of gossip, harmful competitive nature, and stand for your team as a positive influencer and associate. 
 
 Are you in a place where you can't define your soft versus hard skills? If not, we'd love to help! 
 Not only can we help you determine what skills should be included on your resume, but we can coach you on how to squeeze soft skills into your interview, optimizing your career wins at every step of the hiring process.
