 Job 
 Job 14-16 
 January 7, 2020   Patricia

 Click here for The message  “this is dialogue reading..spice it up” 
 
 Job continues 
 Eliphaz round two 
 Job (more blunt than ever) 
 
 I took a course at Lifeway once called “Help, I am not a councilor”. Code for "What NOT to say when someone is in a trial". I learned that I say EVERYTHING WRONG that could possibly be said. One of the reason's this dialogue is difficult is the 3 amigos weave in some truths and it is hard to discern at times. That is what I see Christians doing often. They weave scripture into their advice to make it sound foundation. 
 Job's advice givers decided to use this as an opportunity to “teach” “preach” or “rebuke” Job. And in Job 16, Job says: 
 
 1-5 Then Job defended himself: 
 “I’ve had all I can take of your talk. 
What a bunch of miserable comforters! 
Is there no end to your windbag speeches? 
What’s your problem that you go on and on like this? 
If you were in my shoes, 
I could talk just like you. 
I could put together a terrific harangue 
and really let you have it. 
But I’d never do that. I’d console and comfort, 
make things better, not worse! 
 
 Am I a comfort to my friends in need in trial? Hmmmm. Or am I a windbag? I have been a christian for 14 years, and each year I am reminded that wisdom and sanctification comes only from God. First of all, I don't know their heart! Second, I am not the Holy Spirit. 
 Now for the GOOD part.  The Foreshadow of Christ.  If you have not done your reading yet  and let it fall fresh on you from your Bible first: 
 
 16:19 Even now my witness is in heaven; 
my advocate is on high. 
20 My intercessor is my friend 
as my eyes pour out tears to God; 
21 on behalf of a man he pleads with God 
as one pleads for a friend.

 As if his suffering isn't enough, he's also dealing with these miserable comforters! 
 My favorite is in 16 :3-4 " Won't you ever stop blowing hot air? What makes you keep on talking?" 
 A good message to listen to those around us. G♡d gave us two ears and one mouth for a reason. Like back in 13:5-6 when he says "if only you could be silent! That's the wisest thing you could do. Listen to my charge; pay attention to my arguments" 
 The glory for us is 16:21a "I need someone to mediate between G♡d and me" thank you Lord for sending us a mediator and a wonderful counselor ♡

 do you think this is how his friends really are or is this Satan using them to make Job question God even more?

 I think his friends are just like so many people today, we mix judgement with some theology. I have done it myself. There are so many times I have given some advice and later regretted it because it was my own 2 cents, not necessarily God's. That is why it is so important for us to read the whole Bible, so that if we are called to help a friend in crisis we can with wisdom. Not everything they are saying is wrong, but what they are wrong on…is dead wrong. Job is discerning, because He knows God. What if this advice was given to someone who didn't….it's 3:1, they would have listened to them.

 Karla that is a great question that I did not even factor in. I took a listening class in college and the most important lesson it taught me was to always ask "Do you want my advice or my ear?" before the story even starts. This has helped me in so many situations. It makes me think of which friends are truly my friends. Which friends will be there in my time of need? Will I be the same for them?

 Reading out of a NKJV.. The scripture often has references at the bottom of the page that read: 
“Septuagint reads….” 
And 
“Vulgate reads…..” 
 What are Septuagint and Vulgate?

 Ready to see how geeky I am! I wrote a 1 page paper (for myself) on that a few years ago. History of the Bible. It actually gave me a HUGE appreciation for having a Bible in my house. Let me find it and I will attach it in the "Handouts to Print" section for anyone who wants to geek with me.
