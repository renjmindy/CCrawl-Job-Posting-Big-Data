 #atozchallenge H is for Haste 
 by Lillian Csernica on April 9, 2017 
 In the UK they have a saying. "More haste, less speed." Sounds paradoxical, right? The meaning is simple. The faster you rush through a task, the better the chances of making mistakes. You will then have to go back and correct the mistakes, slowing down your overall progress.

 Way back at the beginning of my efforts to write stories for publication, I was so excited I would blaze through my drafts. I really didn't have a solid grasp of proper story structure, and it showed. Oh boy, how it showed. I was also impatient to fire those stories off in the mail, hoping for my first acceptance letter. What I got was a lot of form rejection letters. 
 Don't be in such a hurry. Take the time to learn your craft. 
 Here comes another paradox: Go ahead and power through that first draft. Don't think too hard, don't worry too much. Just get the story down on paper. The creative rush that makes you want to write a story is one of the best parts of this business. 
 Now that you have something written down, you've got something that can be pondered, expanded, rewritten, and cut back. 
 Back in the beginning of my career, I wanted to dive right into writing a novel. I had no idea what I was doing. I tried to build a plot by reading how-to manuals and piecing together my ideas. What I quickly learned was how big and how daunting the work of writing a novel really is. It takes a lot longer than people realize, even when you know what you're doing. 
 Fortunately, I made a good decision and let all the research I'd done implode into a short story. That story became  Fallen Idol , which I sold to William Raley at After Hours Magazine. That story was later accepted by  Karl Edward Wagner  for  The Year's Best Horror Stories XXI . 
 You want to be a writer? Write. You want to be a published writer? Learn how to tell a story. Respect the art you want to create. Respect the craft that has been practiced, explored, and improved upon by great minds for centuries.

 The Mother of Invention 
 by Lillian Csernica on March 12. 2013 
 It's high time I dragged myself into the  21st Century  by joining the blogosphere. I'm a writer. Fantasy,  dark fantasy , historical romance, horror, nonfiction. I have one novel out,  SHIP OF DREAMS , under my romance pen name of Elaine LeClaire. You can find my short fiction at Tales of Old, Tales to Terrify, and soon in  Midnight Movie  Creature Feature Vol. 2. I'm very fortunate to have a career that lets me work at home because my two sons are both what's now referred to as "special needs" children. 
 They're not so much children anymore. Michael is sixteen. He had to be delivered at only twenty-three weeks, making him a micro-preemie. A  pulmonary hemorrhage  and a grade four plus  brain bleed  left him with cerebral palsy and later seizure disorder. He is medically fragile, an invalid who is either in his wheelchair or his hospital bed. He doesn't let any of that stop him. He's an award-winning artist, a great bowler, and he loves classic rock. Michael has a great smile and a wicked sense of humor. 
 John is fourteen. He went full term, but he did refuse to breathe. His brief bout of hypoxia is what we believe caused his  speech delay . Speech therapy led to an evaluation by a neurologist which resulted in a diagnosis of autism. John is low on the spectrum, with a talent for drawing that began when he started watching " Blue's Clues " at age two. He has taught "Drawing with John" classes at his elementary school both in the classroom and over the school's closed-circuit television broadcasts. John loves digital animation and studies the Special Features options on  DVDs  which give him a behind-the-scenes view of how the artists and programmers work their magic. 
 It's not easy finding time to write when each day I have phone calls to make, medical supplies to order, school projects to supervise, doctor appointments, prescription refills to keep track of, and the other random demands that crop up all the time. I tend to stay close to home for the boys' sakes, so writing lets me run away from home inside my own head. I look forward to sharing the ups and downs of this life with you.

 Who I Am 
 
 
 LillianC 
 I'm a professional writer living in Northern California with my husband and two sons. Fantasy in various forms is my reading and writing pleasure. I'm a history buff, a Japanophile, and I love to learn about language(s). I enjoy making jewelry, using natural materials such as wood, bone, semiprecious stones, and seashells. I collect bookmarks and wind chimes.
