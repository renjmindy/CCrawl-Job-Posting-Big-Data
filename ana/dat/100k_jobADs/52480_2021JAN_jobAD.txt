 PhD Horizons: A Careers Conference for PhD Students 
 Posted on  May 28, 2015  by  researchstudentcareers 
 I hope that you have already seen our  previous blog  on the  exciting new campus event for PhD students  which is being held at Appleton Tower on  Thursday 4 June . There are now just a few places left if you have not already registered. 
 We are very excited to have a  fantastic range of speakers  who will share their personal career journeys post PhD. The speakers will join one of 10 panel sessions covering a wide range of different careers. To make the most of this event we'd encourage you to keep an open mind and attend a range of different panel sessions. This will help you to gain a wider perspective on how PhD careers can develop. 
 A  conference programme  with speaker details can now be found on the event web page at:
