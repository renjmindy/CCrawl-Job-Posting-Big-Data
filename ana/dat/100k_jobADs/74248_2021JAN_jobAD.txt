  3 Great Activities To Keep Your Job Search Moving

 November 24, 2020 
 Sometimes a job search can wear on a person's motivation to keep moving forward, especially if the search has lasted for weeks or months. While qualifications, resumes, and cover letters make a huge difference in whether you'll be hired, your attitude also matters. 
 
 If you're getting tired of looking for jobs, your positive demeanor could turn negative in the wrong environment (i.e. the interview). You need to keep your job search moving. To maintain a positive attitude, it's a good idea to consider engaging in the following activities during the process: 
 Schedule Accordingly 
 Many experts equate a job search to a full-time job. 
 Guess what? Looking for a job shouldn't take up 40 hours of your week! 
 When scheduling time for your  job search , you want to be efficient and productive. The first step is to determine when you'll be the most productive. The next step is to determine how much time you can dedicate to your job search and how long your attention span is for the purpose of scheduling breaks. 
 For example, if you're a morning person who works best in one-hour blocks, you could block 8 a.m. to noon for your job search, with 15-minute breaks after every hour. 
 
 Like anything else in life, you can build in flexibility and adjust as you move forward. 
 Exercise 
 Exercising daily, in addition to maintaining a  healthy diet , are important under normal conditions. But when you are working through a tough circumstance such as a job search, stress can create health issues at a faster rate. 
 To keep your health in check, it's good to set up a daily exercise routine that incorporates cardio and strength training. Also, be sure to take vitamins and eat properly. Good health works wonders in improving your mind and body, while also creating a more positive attitude to carry you through your job hunt. 
 Volunteer 
 Everyone's home life is unique and allows for certain options, but if you find that you have time in your schedule, then consider volunteering at a local organization a couple of days a week. There are a number of benefits that can arise from volunteering. For one thing, you can help someone (or some animal) in need. Also, you will keep your mind sharp so that you're ready to hit the ground running when you do find work. 
 In addition, you get to add your volunteer efforts to your resume to show you've been busy in between jobs. And finally, you get the opportunity to  network with professionals  who might provide you with a lead or two about new career opportunities. 
 If you're able to keep a positive attitude while in between jobs, you're more likely to maintain this attitude when you're finally employed. Don't let a lack of employment sour your demeanor. Instead, consider this time an opportunity to take on new challenges as you wait for your dream job.
