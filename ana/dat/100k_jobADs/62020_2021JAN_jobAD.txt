 iPad Disappointment 
 27 January 201027 January 2010  ~  Bryant  ~  Leave a comment 
 Back in December,  I posted about how I've been trying to shift my life into the digital domain . 
 Today, I watched as Apple dashed these hopes into the ground. Steve Jobs revealed their new tablet,  The iPad . Upon first glance, I saw the iPhone's interface and my heart sunk. 
 Gizmodo covers quite well the myriad disappointments of the iPad , all of which are very valid complaints. However, I'd like to explain my own personal disappointment. 
 Truly, what I wanted was a touchscreen MacBook. Something that could be used to create, but at the same time be large enough -- unlike an iPhone or iPod Touch -- to consume media. Apparently this is a tall order, since the iPad seems hell bent on only media consumption. That isn't to say it's a completely gimped product, you can buy the iWork suite for $30, i.e. it's not the central focus of the device. 
 This is what I was expecting. This video is a concept of Microsoft's Courier Tablet -- something useful, something meant for creation. Yet all we got today is the "iPod Touch XL". 
 Would it have been that hard to put a camera for video chat? Or allow multitasking? Or even put a USB port on the thing so we don't need a dongle? 
 Someone wake me up when this thing can do something other than charge your credit card for media at every turn.
