 Lead major change of supply chain technology capabilities 
 Drive alignment between technology and business solutions architecture across the supply chain and operations 
 Lead the architecture, design and build of technology product and solutions addressing complex business problems

 We are customer-centric, data driven and outcome focused, using lean principles to work iteratively, experiment and learn fast. 
 We work in cross-functional squads which we increasingly include business partners. This allows us to work more closely with our colleagues in food, operations and marketing, enabling greater alignment, collaboration and innovation. 
 Our tech squads have a high level of autonomy to decide both what outcomes they should pursue and how they will achieve them. We expect the same from our IT teams - this is not about “keeping the lights on” but about improving, innovating and automating our technology and processes.

 We work at pace and challenge ourselves to continually improve.
