In this way, exhibits, media interaction and complete theme worlds are formed for trade fairs, exhibitions and showrooms.

 Beauty comes from outside – especially in the world of the automotive industry. A good design cleverly combines aesthetics and physics. It is about a form of presentation that is not only visually attractive but also clever in regard to technology and which can be handled intuitively. In this world, the staff of Volke Kommunikations-Design is working. Organised in the field of competence „Create“ – which is divided into different departments, the staff turns complex content into clear messages in word and image. For this, designers, editors and media designers work hand in hand. 
 Anne Derksen, Fabian Garn und Salvatore Falcone talk about their work at Volke Kommunikations-Design.

 STADTGLANZ Y ARTICLE – FEBRUARY 2018 ISSUE 
 “It started with cutting open engines for the trade fair department at Volkswagen,” explains Eduard Donzow, Head of Business Development. These cut-away exhibits were just the first step, and were soon followed by interactive exhibits and a wide range of other formats designed to bring technical concepts to life and make them easier to understand. The goal: to use media and staging techniques to create maximum impact at trade fairs, exhibitions and showrooms. 
 Wencke Freund and Tim Zielinski talk about their work as project managers at Volke Kommunikations-Design.
