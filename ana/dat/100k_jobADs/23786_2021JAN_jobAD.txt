 Sims 4 Get To Work: Doctor Career – Gameplay Bugs & Thoughts 
 June 14 2015 
 All  patients  who appear at the hospital or other public venues are  Unplayed Sims . Even if the  house call  takes place in a Played sim's home, the patients are still Unplayed visitors. 
 I usually prioritize patients with  sores  as skin overlay (see above pic), as I can immediately rule out  " No Illness" . 
 
 Random Illness Reload Bug 
 
 
 ​For regular hospital cases, ​I always  save before diagnosing  patients. 
 
 
 If I can't clearly interpret the patient's  visual symptoms  , I'll hazard a  50% chance  (1 of 2) at the  " Compelling Diagnosis"  stage. 33.3% is too risky, in my opinion. Forget the 25% or 20% chances available in the  " Weak Diagnosis"  stage.  Keep running more tests  to increase the chances of an accurate diagnosis. 
 
 
 If I'm wrong, I quit without saving back to the main menu, then reload my hospital scenario just before the diagnosis. 
 
 
 Sometimes,  after the reload, my diagnosis choices are completely different . Before I reloaded, it was either  " Gas-and-Giggles"  or _" Itchy Plumbob"_​. ​​ 
 
 
 After I reloaded, it is either ​  " Burnin' Belly"  or  " Llama Flu" . 
 
 After  losing the coin flip  a second time, I reload the exact same scenario once more. This time, the decision is between  " Bloaty Head"  and  " The Triple Threat" . 
 
 
 Fortunately, my doctor makes the "correct" choice this time, and I can  finally  move on to the next patient. 
 If I got it wrong  again  , would the choice be between  " Sweaty Shivers"  and  " Starry Eyes" ? 
 
 This  " random illness bug"  only appears when I reload the game  after a wrong diagnosis . When that happens, it really doesn't matter which option I choose, for it is as random as a coin flip. However, if I can interpret the visual sickness symptoms on my first attempt, these are usually consistent with my diagnosis choices. 
 
 If I'm fortunate, the  Treadmill Test  or  X-Ray Machine  may help me reach a  " Guaranteed Diagnosis"  quickly. 
 
 
 Delivering a Baby 
 
 
 Promotion requirement from L8 to L9 of the Doctor career. 
 
 
 Many work days may go by  without any  " Pregnant patients"  arriving at the hospital. 
 
 
 When that happens, my doctor diagnoses enough regular patients to fill up his performance meter for the day, then plays  Blicblock  on the computer till his shift ends. Fortunately for me/him, he only waited 2 sim days… 
 
 
 There 's no point in making other sims in the neighborhood pregnant. 
 
 
 When the time comes, the  " Pregnant Patient"  (she will be labelled as such) will be  spawned by the game  , with a dialog box informing the doctor about the arrival of the "Pregnant Patient". Drop everything else and lead her to surgery  immediately . 
 
 
 Towards the end of the surgery, a baby container will automatically appear, and the delivered baby will be put into it. 
 
 
 
 However, the baby container (and the baby) suddenly  disappear  moments later. 
 
 The formerly "Pregnant Patient" emerges from the Surgery machine, walks out of the surgery ward without her baby bump…  and without her baby . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 That doesn't appear to matter, as the surgery was obviously a success, and the "Deliver a Baby" goal checked as completed​, with promotion to L9 on that same day.​ 
 
 
 After my doctor's shift​​, I checked "manage households" in neighborhood mode, to see if the baby is with its mother in the relevant household. 
 
 
 Nope.  No baby. 
 No child,  not even after several sim days. 
 My aging setting is "Aging  Off  for ALL  Played  Sims", but "Aging  On  for all  Unplayed  Sims".
