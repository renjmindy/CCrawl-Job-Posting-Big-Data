 Not everyone who wants to work from home is looking for a full-time gig. Sometimes they just want a few extra bucks to help make ends meet. Other times they need to work around children or caring for ill or elderly family members. Below is a list of resources that hire for part-time positions (many hire full time as well). Pay varies from $8 to $15 per hour (sometimes more) depending on the job and your experience. By working 20 to 30 hours a week, you can earn $700 to $1,900 per month. 
 Captioning (TV/Video) Jobs 
 If you enjoy watching television or videos and can type quickly, you can become a captioner. The verbatim words spoken by people on TV that are provided for the hearing impaired or as transcripts are created by captionists. Good, experienced captionists can make $75 per hour.

 Customer Service   Jobs 
 If you've ever called to order something, get support on an order or book a trip, it's possible you talked to a home-based customer service representative. Customer service jobs are always in demand. Although some require past experience, many only require that you have a pleasant speaking voice, can keep your cool with difficult customers, and have a quiet place to work. Some may have specific computer requirements, as well. 
 For a video on how to get customer service jobs, plus a list of companies you can check out for part-time work, read  How to Get Work-At-Home Customer Service Jobs 
 Mock Juror   Jobs 
 If you’re interested in the legal process you can get paid to help lawyers be their best in court. While some mock juries take place at a courthouse, many mock jury jobs use of audio, video and text, to review court information online and then answer questions for the attorney. Pay for online mock jury work is $10 to $50.

 Teaching / Tutoring   Jobs 
 If you have a background in education and feel comfortable teaching through VoIP tools such as video Skype, teaching or tutoring may be a good fit. Like many other types of work-at-home jobs, tutoring and teaching usually requires specialized skills, experience and education. You may be required to have a teaching credential in the state seeking help. Some require a masters degree.

 Transcription   Jobs 
 If your goal is to sit home and type, transcription is for you. However, you can't simply sign up to be a transcriptionist. Most employers looking for transcribers want someone who is fast and accurate, often requiring a typing speed of 40, 50 or even 80 words per minute. Depending on the industry, you may also need specialized knowledge such as medical or legal terminology.

 Virtual Support   Jobs 
 The growth of online entrepreneurs continues to fuel the need for virtual support staff to take care of a variety of tasks from calendar and email management, customer support, research, social media and more. There is no specific training to be a virtual assistant, but you do need to know how to do and use software the entrepreneur needs. For example, you may need to own Word or how to organize a spreadsheet in Excel.

 Writing   Jobs 
 While the web is becoming increasingly visual, there is still a need for writers. Although you don't necessarily need a degree in English, you do need to be able to write clearly and concisely. Some businesses that need writers would like you have knowledge or experience in the industry it needs content for. For example, I can write health and wellness articles because I have an AFAA fitness certification. Other times, you can find writing work related to your hobby or in topics you're passionate about.

 I didn't realize that I may have been helped by a work-form-home customer service representative before. That seems like the perfect job for someone who is comfortable speaking over the phone but doesn't want to drive to work every day. I would be really interested in finding a job like that once I am finished with school. It would give me time to work on my hobbies.
