 Role overview 
 About you 
 You've been around long enough that you've seen how it goes - good and bad. You love it "when a plan comes together" and you dissect the outcome even so. The highs have provided plenty of food for thought, but the lows - the lows you never want to experience again, yeah those lows, the lows are your fertilizer. You don't want to count how many times you've said "If I ever get a chance to do it right... " This is your chance. 
 About White Rabbit Intel 
 We're driving change in the B2B analytics space. We pair best in class techniques from CI/CD, Microservices, AI, and more. We value ethics. We value relationships. We've been called an "anti-corporation corporation". Tired of working with people who chew you up, use your ideas, and then leave you hanging emotionally (stressed, undervalued, unappreciated) or physically (static salary, no career progression, laid off even)? 
 What you need 
 An open, curious mind with a get it done attitude. The drive to make your services and packages well-engineered, an ability to shift gears as needed, and the insight to know when what you have will work. 
 What you'll do 
 Engineer across the stack using Python, NodeJS, ReactJS, DynamoDB/Mongo, Postgres, Redis, and Docker. Use AWS - familiarity there is a plus. Work with/on a full CI/CD pipeline. Design and build across the stack - data, containers, dev-ops, apis, front-end, testing (unit, integration, end-to-end, load, performance). 
 Help us define best practices, architecture, and innovation at Whtie Rabbit. 
 Let's chat.
