 About this project 
 sales-marketing / e-mail-marketing 
 USD 50 - 100 
 I have a commercial and residential cleaning company. I want to look for companies in Omaha Nebraska to clean their offices, I will be looking to get lawyer offices, Real Estate offices, or any kind of offices to clean during the day or night. 
I need to get to as many possible commercial clients as I can. I want to make contact with companies in order to give them my information, and get an appointment to talk to them. 
 This is the first time I will be doing this kind of marketing, I would like to have someone who can call the customers to introduce my company and request a appointment for me to go to speak directly with the property or maintenainance manager. 
I think the way to measure the results will be by confirmed appointments.
