 Yesterday after I read about "cotton candy grapes" all I wanted to do was live in California where they HAD them. Why don't I live in California? That is a question I have asked myself my entire life. So, if someone would please give my husband a hefty paying Software Engineering Managerial Job or something like that then we can move and I CAN be one of the first people to eat these grapes. You have no idea what this would mean to me. You know I am the ultimate CONSUMER and that I adore sweet things, so please can someone at least send me some? Pretty please with sugar on top? Oh right, you don't even need sugar with these sweeties from what I've been told. 
 I need to google. I need to google NOW. Are they in New York yet. Hang on, I'll let you know. Wait, I'm selfish when it comes to food, I'll let you know after I find them and buy them. I'm sorry, sometimes it has to be like that. Food First. I am the new product consumer of the world. Someone should hire ME for that job. I'm obsessed with food. (Can you tell?) 
 I googled these Cotton Candy Grapes and found that they were available in a few select stores in my area. I posted a question on a mom's group if anyone had any connections. I could not believe that everyone knew about these babies, I was the last to know. There were sightings. This morning, not feeling my best, I took my dog for a ride, having no sense of direction ( I would only do this for food ) jumped into the car and headed to unknown territory. I asked a very nice person (stranger) for directions to the new supermarket in the other town and wouldn't you know it, I was only a block away! 
 With the window open for Lexi, my dog, I ran, literally ran, to the entrance, got a cart for balance and breathlessness and entered directly into the produce aisle. Oh, My God. Right in front of my face were green grapes that said "Cotton Candy" on them. This, people, made me so happy. I immediately stole, I mean tasted one and I was in my glory. Two bunches later (they are very expensive) I was back in my car heading home. 
 I know that some people (my sister) will hate them and others will love them. I put mine in the freezer for sweet treat. I posted them on my Facebook page. I got a lot of "Huh?" "What" and "I don't understand." comments. They could not grasp the concept of a grape that tasted like cotton candy. Pity. I also got a comment from one old friend who said "I was a pisser." Thank you, Lisa K. You make me proud. (We have known each other since grade school.) 
 In the meantime, keep your eyes open, for those green grapes with the pink lettering: Cotton Candy Grapes. You have to try them, even if it's only once. And, if anyone knows of any new products coming out or if they have tried any new product please email me, you can reach me here at hibernationnow.wordpress.com in the comment section and I will definitely reply.
