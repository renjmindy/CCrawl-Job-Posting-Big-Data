  This Christmas Movie Can Help You Find A Job For Next Year  
 Ryan Niessen 
 December 19, 2014 
 My wife and I LOVE Christmas movies. The classics, like  The Grinch  ,  Christmas Vacation,  and  Home Alone  are some of our favorites…  Related:   3 Steps For Transforming Your Passion Into A Career  (Though it’s hilarious to think that  Home Alone  wouldn’t exist in modern day times. The 10-yr old kid would have a cell phone and call his parents right away. They’d figure out a plan and live happily ever after. My, how the times have changed…) But you have to hand it to the creators of  Rise of the Guardians   -  the new-ish Christmas movie starring the Easter Bunny, Santa, and Jack Frost in an epic battle against the Boogeyman. Like other brilliant animated movies, they do a great job of making thing interesting for kids and adults… And for you -  they even throw in some wisdom that can help you find your dream job.  In a minute, I’ll tell you what that is, and how you can use it to  make 2015 your best year ever.  (By the way, there’s also  free resource here  that’ll help you find the most inspiring companies and get their attention.) 
 
 Why Finding Your ‘Center’ Can Help You Get Your Ultimate Job 
 The struggle that the main character, Jack Frost, goes through the entire movie is figuring who he is and what he’s meant to do... …Which is essentially the same core struggle we all go through in life. Finding our way - and what we’re best at - isn’t easy. Thankfully, there are  tools out there to help you get there.  The tool they use in this movie is your “center." Santa explains it to Jack Frost like this: On the outside, people see you in a few different ways. You might be powerful, successful, or even jolly (in Santa’s case).  Yet, as you peel back the layers, everyone has a center.  Santa’s center is wonder. So, his job is to spread wonder to the world at Christmas each year. Jack’s is fun. His job is to create snow days and start snowball fights. (Not a bad gig, if you ask me) … And while you may not be able to deliver presents or start snowball fights for a living, (wouldn’t that be awesome, though)  you can  find and use your center to find the best job for you. 
 How To Find And Use Your ‘Center’ 
 In the movies, they conquer this issue in a hour and a half. Yet, for many people this process can take a little while. You can start by taking some strengths and personality tests to gain some insight into how you work. I’ve taken every test I could find, and received a TON of valuable insight as a result. Then there’s other methods like journaling, meditation, and even asking your friends and family members what they think you’re best at. Then, once you start on a path, you course correct as you go. Like Tom Peters says:  Test fast, fail fast, adjust fast.  And most importantly, have some fun doing it. So, remember, finding your ‘center’ - or what love most and are best at spreading - is critical to finding a job you love and creating long term success. Once you find it, you can  make sure any job opportunity you accept is aligned with your ‘center.'  And if you’d like a bit more help finding it and getting your ultimate job,  check out this free video I put together alongside my mentor.  It contains three solid job seeking tips you can apply today to  find and get your dream job  with an inspiring company. Good luck, and happy holidays!
