 During my years as a high school art teacher, I strove to release my students' artistic potential. Jeff Koons' vision of art itself releasing the viewer's potential has never crossed my mind. I've always considered great works of art as that which move us to see our world with a clearer vision and appreciation. I suppose, in that light, art can lead us to a deeper understanding of who we are as individuals and our potential for becoming our better selves.
