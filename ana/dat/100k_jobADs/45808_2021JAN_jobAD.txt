 The announcement made by BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA) of hundreds of jobs at two of its Bowen Basin mines is a welcome relief to regional Queenslanders. 
 In yet another sign of the green shoots returning to the coal industry mines will engage about 200 people at its Peak Downs and Saraji mines. While jobs have been advertised locally for some time, Townsville is set to benefit due to lack of skilled workers in the area. 
 Queensland Resources Council Chief Executive Ian Macfarlane said it was great news for people in the north and the broader Queensland coal sector, which had been struggling through a downturn over the past few years. 
 'This is another sign of green shoots for the Bowen Basin, an area which delivered much of the AUS$1.6 billion boost to royalties for the state government,' Mr Macfarlane said. 
 'It follows on from the good news we are seeing right across the Queensland coal industry with record exports last year and new mines opening up.'
