  HELP! My Ex Keeps Stalking Me & It Could Cost Me My JOB  
 Kelly Kuehn 
 July 09, 2019 
 In this week's edition of  Well,This Happened  , the series that lets  you  become a career coach, we tackle a very uncomfortable workplace issue from Tara. Do you think you know how to handle this situation? Let's find out... 
 
 Tara writes: 
 " _  WELL, THIS HAPPENED…  _ A few months back, I broke up with a boyfriend who I felt was toxic. Since then, he has been making my life a living hell. 
 He calls me at work all the time. If I don't answer his texts or phone calls on my personal cell phone, he'll call the company number and ask for me again and again until I take his call. 
 This has been going on for weeks and my superior gave me a warning about it because he's bothering my co-workers with his constant calls. He said that if I can't get a handle on this situation then he's going to have to let me go since it's disruptive to the rest of the office staff. 
 _  What do I do? How can I address this so I don't lose my job? Help!"  _ 
 This is a  seriously  uncomfortable situation to be in, Tara. Being stalked by an ex is bad enough, but having an old flame constantly call the office and jeopardize your job just adds on to an already stressful situation. 
 If you were in Tara's shoes, how would you handle this? Let us know by voting for one of the options below. 
 A - Ask your co-workers to be more understanding of the situation so you don't get in trouble. 
 B - Call your ex and tell him to stop harassing you at work. 
 C - Start looking for a new job. Your ex won't know where you work if you have a new job and the harassment will stop. 
 D - Take steps to prevent the behavior on your own, but keep HR/Management in the loop. 
 To Be Continued... 
 Be sure to check back later this week for our follow-up video that will recap the options and reveal what the right one is. 
 Good luck!
