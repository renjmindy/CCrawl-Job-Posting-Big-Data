  S.M.A.R.T. Goals For Job Seekers  
 Jim Schreier 
 November 26, 2014 
 There are two perspectives on S.M.A.R.T. Goals for job seekers, one from the viewpoint of the activities you perform as part of your job search, the other, really understanding the expectations of a position being considered.  Related: 3 Steps To Create Your Own Career Development Plan  S.M.A.R.T. Goals, originally attributed to Peter Drucker, has been interpreted with some various modifications and additions, but generally refers to goals that are  S  pecific,  M  easurable,  A  ction-Oriented (Attainable), Results-Bound (Relevant), and  T  ime Focused. There's strong agreement on the “Specific" and “Measurable," with several variations the “__A.R.T." elements. Specificity, Measurable, and Time are generally agreed upon as core elements. 
 
 Job Search 
 For Job Seekers, S.M.A.R.T. Goals can be a powerful tool to guide the process. While many individuals are familiar with the idea from its common work application, it's a new – and much needed – process for many job seekers. And for those unfamiliar with the idea, it can be further complicated by the claim of goals being set for them in their work experience – goals that are absolutely NOT S.M.A.R.T. So, a job seeker might just set an extremely broad goal, like “finding a new job," or might set some seemingly more specific goals like: 
 
 Revise my resume 
 Contact my references 
 Search online for job possibilities 
 Send thank-you e-mails 
 
 While setting some goals, any goals, particularly if there written down, is better than not having any goals, these are definitely not S.M.A.R.T. Goals. More importantly, goals like these deprive a job seeker of the power of having S.M.A.R.T. Goals. Research on goal setting clearly demonstrates the power – and the dangers – of goal setting. Goals that are not S.M.A.R.T. fail to motivate top performance – or lead to inaction. Goals that are set too high (not Realistic) frequently prompt a person's decision to “give up." Understanding the dynamics of goal setting can be a powerful tool for a job seeker's success. Let's turn the examples above into S.M.A.R.T. Goals: 
 For The Interview 
 Understanding  S.M.A.R.T.  Goals can also be a powerful tool for a candidate to use during an interview. Job postings, ads, and even job descriptions can be filled with generalities and duties that, at best, describe average performance. A job seeker is frequently asked “Do you have any questions?" Seize this opportunity whenever given. Unless the following has been made clear to you, ask: “If I were offered and accepted this position, and you considered me to be extremely successful in my first year, what did I accomplish?" Then, probe! And probe whenever you can during an interview when you don't have clear, specific (S.M.A.R.T.) expectations from the interviewer: 
 
 
 Specifically, what do you expect the person in this job to accomplish in the first 90 days? 
 
 In the first six months? 
 In the first year? 
 
 
 
 The Job Description says the job includes “making sales calls." How many sales calls is considered acceptable in a day? In a month? 
 
 How many sales calls is considered “outstanding performance? 
 How many of the company's sales staff regularly achieve acceptable performance? 
 
 
 
 The Job Description says that job includes “leading the team." 
 
 How many people are on the team? 
 How many members are new? Long-time members? 
 Is the team facing in specific challenges? Problems? 
 What resources are available for developing the team? Training? Assessments? 
 What's the time frame for improving the team's performance? 
 
 
 
 You mentioned “the usual customer service" responsibilities, could you tell me… 
 
 What does “outstanding" customer service mean for this business? 
 What kind of training is provided for customer service? 
 What are the customer service expectations in terms of working with colleagues? 
 (Somewhat advanced but a good question) Is compensation tied to the quality of service provided by a person in this job? 
 
 
 
 These probing questions need to be customized for each individual position. But just like the importance of thoroughly preparing your responses to questions about your experience, this is where you thoroughly prepare by 1) studying available information about the organization and possible position and 2) preparing questions that probe for: 
 
 Specificity:  are you given answers with clear, “action" verbs? 
 Measurable:  is there a clear measurement (a number) that indicates a performance level? 
 Attainable:  are the expectations achievable, too low (usually not specific) or unrealistically high? 
 Results:  are the results of the actions specified indicated? 
 Time:  are the expectations framed in terms of when? 
 
 S.M.A.R.T. Goals can be a very powerful part of a successful job search – and a powerful tool for a job seeker to use during the interview process – if a job seeker learns and practices the process.
