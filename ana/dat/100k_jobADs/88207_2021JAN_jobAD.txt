 Analytical, process-minded, results-driven change agent required to lead global change projects for a leading Logistics & Freight business based in Heathrow. 
 I'm currently recruiting within the global freight division of a global third party logistics provider; with a significant amount of opportunity for operational improvement across the globe, they're currently recruiting for a logistics expert to lead a project team responsible for operational improvement. 
 You and your team will work closely with the global business to identify, evaluate, and execute operational improvement across the world. Projects will include process improvement, route development, carrier management & development and broader business change across support functions. 
 Your background is in the global freight industry and you have likely run a region via a Control Tower or similar. You understand what good looks like, but you've also proven the ability to work from the bottom up to understand and deliver change where it's needed most. You're systems-strong, numerate and analytical, but you also have high empathy and work well with people to achieve results that work for all stakeholders. You've transitioned into Programme Management or Business Change and you have proven Project Management skills, able to run with several complex projects simultaneously. 
 Based in Heathrow, the successful candidate will be paid approximately £65,000 plus bonus and benefits. Travel will be limited initially but in time, you will be required to visit internal stakeholders across the world and 25% travel will be expected. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
