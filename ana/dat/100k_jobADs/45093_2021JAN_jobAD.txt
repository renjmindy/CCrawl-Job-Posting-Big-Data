 Job Hunting as a Disabled Person 
 As a recent Masters graduate who’s not long  moved into her own flat . The next thing on my “being an adult” list is getting a job. So I thought I’d give you a little insight into some of the things I have to consider most when job hunting as a disabled person. 
 What I Want or am Qualified to Do 
 I don’t think this part is much different to job hunting as an able-bodied person. As someone with a First-Class Bachelors degree and a Distinction at Masters level (allow me the single brag, I worked my butt off), the qualification part isn’t often a concern. However, I still need my PhD for some of the research roles I want. My problem is that I’d quite like to be a Support Worker in some capacity, at least through my PhD. And I regularly hold back from applying for roles where more personal or physical caring is required because I wonder how I’d be seen at an interview. I wonder if employers will see past my disability and see how I can provide support to another individual whilst also needing accommodations myself. I understand that it may be a health and safety thing, but I know I’d be capable of providing support as long as I was physically and safely able to in some way. 
 What I Physically Can Do 
 Ah yes, while we’re here. We best talk physical limitations. Obviously I couldn’t do anything too strenuous or physical (involving lifting or the suchlike), but not because I couldn’t physically do it. More just because it would take me longer and wouldn’t fit into company ideals of getting as much done as possible. I also can’t do anything involving specific hand eye coordination because mine is SHOCKING. 
 So I’m most likely to be in some form of office role just because of the lack of strenuous physical demands. However, even there I’d need adaptation: An accessible location (i.e. city) to work in, an accessible building to work in, possibly an electronic desk, possibly certain kinds of accessibility software such as speech to text (depending on the role). These are the kind of adaptations I won’t mention until at least interview (unless I know from the job description they’ll be necessary).  This is just so I can fully understand the kind of adaptations I’ll need, to make me as good as possible at the role, before I ask for them. 
 Whilst we’re discussing what I can’t do in a role, how about we reverse it and think about what I as a disabled person can bring to a role? Adaptability: Lord knows we’re used to adapting to different situations as disabled people facing inaccessibility, and that adaptability comes in handy in an everchanging world. Perseverance: Again, I’m constantly used to working through or around issues as a disabled person, and that resilience and stubbornness to give up on a task will hopefully give me an extra edge when it comes to facing setbacks or difficult tasks in the workplace. But I think the most important thing I can bring is perspective, particularly when it comes to products. Most products are marketed at an able-bodied audience and so the disabled customer doesn’t often come into the conversation. I believe that would change if there was a disabled employee at the table to discuss these kinds of things. 
 Travel 
 The other aspect that keeps coming up in my job hunt is travel. Thinking about the length of a commute, and how that’s likely to be longer than the same commute for an able-bodied person. Wondering if a commute is even possible and if the train station near my prospective workplace is  accessible, alongside wondering if the workplace is accessible. THEN there’s the fact that some roles require a full drivers licence (which I am not LEGALLY ALLOWED to possess) without stating why it’s necessary to have a drivers licence. The number of times I’ve found a role I want with a feasible commute, to discover I’m essentially not allowed to commute because the role requires a full drivers licence without an obvious reason why, is INFURIATING. 
 Interview 
 One unexpected plus I’ve found is regarding being put forward to the interview stage for a role. On some applications I have seen the option to state that you are a disabled applicant. You then explain a little bit about your disability and adaptations you may need at the interview stage. The application then says that those who meet the main necessary criteria for the role and have identified themselves as disabled will be progressed to an automatic interview under what I believe is called a “Two Ticks” system. I’m not sure how widespread the scheme is as I’ve only seen it on Research Assistant applications at universities I’ve applied to, but I’m certainly intrigued to learn a little more about how the scheme works. 
 Update: I've now learned some more about the Two Ticks scheme. Firstly it's now called Disability Confident and has 3 tiers. The first two tiers (Committed and Employer) are self assessed as Disability Confident whereas the top tier in the scheme (Leader) has to be assessed as Disability Confident by an external body. 
 Final Thoughts 
 I hope you’ve enjoyed my initial thoughts on job hunting as a disabled person. I hope it shows a need for open mindedness when looking at job applications or designing job descriptions. You may be losing out on the perfect candidate because they’re disabled and you’ve made the role seem inaccessible to them, when in reality it could be accessible with some thought and adaptation. I hope it also shows that disabled people want to do non office-based roles and those roles should be accessible where possible. 
 No doubt I’ll update this as I continue the job-hunting process. 
 Stay Invincible!

 I really like that you talk about way you can bring to the table. Adaptability is an important trait that many have a hard time adjusting. Great post!

 * Thank you, glad you enjoyed the post. I think it’s really key to focus on what I add rather than how being disabled may negatively impact me in the workforce

 * Thank you, I’m glad you found the post insightful, but it’s kind of heartbreaking that these kinds of experiences are widespread and not just me. I wish this was less of an issue

 I definitely can relate to you on this subject. What I can't seem to understand is why it seems that potential employers, for whatever reason, think just because a person has a disability (especially if they can't drive), are somehow not "as intelligent" as able-bodied people. Whenever I go into an interview, things always start off normal. But when they inquire about my driving situation, and I explain why I am unable to drive due to disability, everything changes. They begin talking down to me like a child and act as if I'm unable to comprehend them. It's downright cruel and humiliating. We're just as capable as anyone. So we get around and operate a little bit differently, who cares? It shouldn't stop people from taking a chance on us. Like you, I too, am on the job hunt. I wish you nothing but the best of luck. Sending you positive vibes and lots of well-wishes. ❤

 * Thank you for your well wishes, good luck to you too. Yes I feel the same, whenever I'm asked about my driving situation in an interview I always say I'm legally not allowed to drive, to differentiate from not being able to drive in terms of "not having passed my test". I hoped that would make things a little more favourable towards me, but it's more difficult to make that clear on a form.

 Wow. This is such an important post. I’ve just posted a series about job hunting- and how difficult it is- particularly in the current climate- and that’s as a physically able person. I really admire your approach to this, and I think improving disability access to workplaces is very important. I wish you all the best with your job search and congratulations on your uni achievements!!

 I commend you for writing such an important post, Em. Adaptability is key, but the world of office and non-office jobs should also become more accessible and state it clearly when it is. Good luck job hunting!

 i love how you focus on the positive aspects - like what you can do in a job setting instead of focusing on the negative. i think we all can take that as a reminder to always showcase our strengths and combat our weaknesses in a way that doesn't overshadow the strengths. good luck to you in your job hunting! im sure you will find something great!
