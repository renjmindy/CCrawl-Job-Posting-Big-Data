 Following a period of change which has resulted in huge growth for my client we urgently require a financial analyst to support the finance director with new reporting requirements and analysis. The demand for this role will be based on ad hoc needs from the new head office and many of the requirements will need to be developed from scratch. 
 The focus of this role is to provide analytical support and develop performance KPIs for the business, for example ROI analysis, cost analysis and performance improvements. However, as group develops and requires more information these requirements will change so this role needs a high level of flexibility and the ability to move focus very quickly. 
 The successful candidate will be a qualified accountant with experience of providing high quality analysis and insight at group level. A high level of excel ability is essential alongside the willingness to change direction quickly. Ideally, the right candidate will be able to bring ideas from previous roles and make suggestions regarding reporting and process improvements. 
 This is a super role for an individual to step into a high profile, high pressure position and make a positive impact on the future of this organisation. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
