  Dream Job Called, But I Found Another Job, Help?  
 Work It Daily 
 April 02, 2009 
 Dear Experts, A company I've always wanted to work for had a job posting recently. I applied but didn't hear anything for a month. In that time, I was interviewed and hired by another company. I like it, but it's not ideal. Well, guess what? The dream company called and wants to set up an interview. What do I do? Say 'no' and accept that I lost my chance to work there or go on the interview and see what happens? If I got the job... what would I tell my new employer? Would it ruin my credibility?  Our Twitter Advice Project (T.A.P.) is no longer an active campaign. To find an answer to the above question, please use the "Search" box in the right-hand column of this website.
