 Even if you’re someone who has a regular appointment with a salon to have your nails done, there are lots of things that you can do in between appointments to maintain your nails. We’ve recently added CND to our brands, the global leader in professional nail, hand and foot beauty, so we thought we’d take a look at the products they offer to show you what you can do for your hands until your next nail appointment: 
 CND Cuticle Eraser 
 If your cuticles are fast growers, you may find that they look ragged before your next appointment. Cutting them yourself can be tricky and potentially damaging, so using CND Cuticle Eraser is the best thing to use. It micro exfoliates cuticles with a rich, creamy blend of AHA that effectively moisturises cuticles and helps prevent hangnails, keeping your hands looking neat and tidy. 
 CND RescueRXx 
 If your nails have become damaged for any reason, you’ll need a product which can help to repair the. CND RescueRXx is a highly effective treatment from CND that repairs damaged nails with the power of keratin protein and moisturising jojoba oil. With daily use, peeling and white spots are dramatically reduced. 
 CND RidgeFx 
 If your nails are ridged but you don’t want to deal with the effort of buffing them yourself, this ridge-filling product from CND is the perfect way to get smooth nails with minimal effort. This is a nail surface enhancer and ridge filler that smooths out ridges and masks imperfections for a beautiful colour application and chip resistant wear. 
 CND Solar Oil 
 Nails and cuticles are one area which needs lots of moisture, but many people forget to moisturise them. This oil from CND is an award-winning formula which drives moisture deep into the nail and cuticles, combining vitamin E and jojoba oils to reduce visible signs of aging and keep hands soft and supple. 
 CND Solar Oil Nail and Cuticle Care Pen 
 This nail and cuticle care pen is the pen version of CND’s award-winning solar oil, which gives you a convenient and portable application method. It’s perfect for shoving in your handbag and is a favourite with nail care professionals. Repeated use actually drives the oils deeper in the natural nail, for results that only get better with time. 
 Don't Just Wash and Go

 While you might be tempted to jump in the shower, wash and go, we would suggest that for the sake of your skin, you don’t. 
 By adding a moisturiser into the mix, you will find that your skin isn’t just clean but also hydrated which means it will be softer and smooth too. 
 At Pure Beauty, we sell a range of fantastic products and are confident that we will have something that is right for you. 
 The  Elemis Sweet Orchid Body Cream  is a nourishing, everyday product that intensely hydrates and it smells pretty amazing too. Thanks to a blend of rich oils and exotic extracts brimming with fatty acids, anti-oxidants, and vitamins, just washed skin will drink up the goodness and feel better than ever. 
 Dermalogica Body Hydrating Cream  is an advanced body cream packed with Hydroxy Acids and Essential Plant Oils that help to smooth and condition the skin. Sugar Cane and Apple have been combined with Lactic Acid to relieve dryness, while Essential Oils of Sandalwood, Orange, Clary Sage, Patchouli and Rosemary hydrate the skin and lock in much-needed moisture. Green Tea, Lavender, Tea Tree and Chamomile oils have also been added for an extra level of soothing and softening and give this product an amazing scent. 
 Decleor Nourishing Body Balm  is a totally gorgeous product that really does help to soothe skin that is tired and dry. Enriched with Frankincense Essential Oil, Shea Butter, Tamanu and Macadamia oils, skin feels nourished and softer from the very first application. With a unique texture and delicious smell, this luxurious balm is also ideal for massage and makes the perfect present for a friend who needs a boost. 
 We totally love the  Elemis Exotic Frangipani Monoi Body Cream  at Pure-Beauty. This luxurious body cream is enriched with the omega 3, 6, 7 and Oleic acid rich Macadamia Oil which is Rich and when applied after a shower or bath, skin is left feeling nourished, deeply hydrated and smelling of Frangipani Flowers. For silky smooth skin, massage the cream into cleansed, dry skin morning and evening and you will be so pleased you did. When you can relax a little longer, try using the  Elemis Frangipani Monoi Shower Cream  followed by the  Elemis Frangipani Monio Salt Glow  and you will fall in love with the beautiful softness of your skin from the very first application. 
 Best used after the  Elemis Skin Nourishing Milk Bath , for maximum results, the  Elemis Skin Nourishing Body Cream  is a winner in our book. Packed with skin nourishing Camellia, Macadamia and Jojoba oils, this rich lotion helps to revive dry skin, while softening and balancing at the same time. Oat Kernel has been combined with a Sesame and Shea Butter base which ensures even excessively dry skin is left feeling silky soft and healthy looking. 
 Next week wanted to mention the fabulous  Jan Marini Bioglycolic Hand and Body Lotion  which is a clever blend of Glycolic Acid, Aminophylline, and Shea Butter. This product improves the appearance of ageing and environmentally damaged skin as well as helping with texture. If you are looking for supple, smooth, healthy-looking skin, apply once or twice a day and we think you will be pleased with the results. 
 Finally, if you want to add moisture, and colour, we suggest trying out the  Decleor Gradual Glow Hydrating Body Milk.  The light, melting texture is easily and quickly absorbed into the skin and offers a beautifully natural sun-kissed look from the very first application. Magnolia Essential Oil has been added to soothe the skin, Narcissus Bulb prolongs that 'tan' and Vanilla Extract protect the skin against external irritants. As you skin gets a gentle golden glow, it will also look and feel intensely moisturised and soft so it is a win, win. 
 If you would like more information about these products or would like to try some  samples ,  get in touch  and we would love to help.
