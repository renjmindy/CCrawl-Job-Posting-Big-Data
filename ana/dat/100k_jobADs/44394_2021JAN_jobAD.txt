  Career Prep: Sleeping With the Boss, Tell HR?  
 Work It Daily 
 October 17, 2012 
 Job search takes practice – just like studying for the SAT. That’s why we came up with daily  Career Prep  questions to help you “study” for your job search! Here’s today’s question: Joe just found out that Mike, a guy who started on the same day as him a year ago, is having an affair with their  boss . The company handbook says there can’t be any inter-office dating. But, since Mike is the one that told Joe, he doesn't want to risk his own job should the boss found out he was the one to tell HR. Joe has no idea how HR handles these things. [poll id="65"]  Image Credit: Shutterstock
