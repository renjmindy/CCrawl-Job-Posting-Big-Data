 ESPN Milwaukee 
 Promotions Director 
 Milwaukee's ESPN radio was an exciting time to be part of as it was it its beginning stages and development as a new ESPN branded sports station in Milwaukee. As the Promotions Director my key responsibilites were to plan, organize and execute the promotions that went was pitched to clients for advertising. In addition, any type of cross promotion opportunities with our local sport teams and athletes associated with the station. I also had opportunity to act as an Emcee for our Admirals Hockey games, and cover media for the Milwaukee Bucks, I even had a short stint of a radio show called "Sports in the City" where I talked about the fun experiences and conversations I've had with athletes what were not always sports related. The experience with Milwaukee's ESPN radio taught me so much from the business and sales to the production side of media and the radio industry.
