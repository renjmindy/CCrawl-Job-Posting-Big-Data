  What You Didn't Learn About Job Search In School  
 Ariella Coombs 
 June 14, 2017 
   
 When you were in school, there’s a pretty good your teachers didn’t teach you how to look for a job when it was time for you to graduate. That’s no surprise. Most of us don’t  learn how to job search  in school. That’s part of the reason why it’s so hard to find a job once you’ve graduated. But there’s one thing we WISH everyone learned while they were still in school, and that’s… job boards don’t work. The chances of an employer contacting you after you apply to a job are incredibly slim. It’s an “easy” way to job search, and people flood the job boards because of it. That means, there’s a high level of competition for each job that’s posted online. As a result, it’s VERY hard to stand out. Oh, and when you throw in the fact that software is nixing applications on silly, little “mistakes” or inconsistencies, it makes it even harder to get in front of employers. “It’s so easy that it’s broken,” said career expert J.T. O’Donnell. According to O’Donnell, in order to conduct a proper job search these days, you need to do the following: 
 
 
 Figure out what companies you want to work for 
 Find out who works at these companies 
 Network with those people 
 
 This is actually much easier than you might realize. As long as you learn how to conduct a proactive job search using the right job search tools, you’ll be able to stand out to employers and land great opportunities. “You have to take ownership of your job search,” said O’Donnell. “You are a business-of-one. You have to market your services to employers.” Job search is much more efficient (and fun!) when you go about it the right way. So, even though you didn’t learn this skill in school, you CAN master it using the right  job search tools. 
 Wish your job search was easier? 
 If you’re struggling through a frustrating job search, it can feel like you’re never going to land a job. But you can and you will!  Watch this free 20-minute video tutorial  “The Ultimate Technique For An Easier Job Search” to find out how you can get out of your career rut.  WATCH NOW!
