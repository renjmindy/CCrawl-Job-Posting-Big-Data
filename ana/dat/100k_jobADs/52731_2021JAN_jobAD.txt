 Making the FlexJobs Top 100—Second Year in a Row 
 __01/28/2015 
 Out of 30,000+ Companies 
 Working Solutions (WSOL) welcomes being recognized by FlexJobs as #13 of its Top 100 Companies to Watch for Telecommuting and Remote Jobs in 2015. Turns out the number 13 can be lucky. 
 We’re in good company with name brands such as Amazon, American Express, General Electric, 3M, McKesson, Salesforce and Xerox all chosen after FlexJobs analyzed more than 30,000 companies in its database. 
 And we subscribe to what FlexJobs founder and CEO Sara Sutton Fell said: “The organizations on this list are among those leading the charge to show that remote work options are a part of successful 21st-century workplaces." 
 Her words resonate and align with the business philosophy we’ve practiced since founding Working Solutions. And we know they ring true in serving our clients and their customers for almost 20 years. 
 It’s a belief that’s lived out every day through our national network of independent agents who pride themselves on delivering great technical support, service and customer care. 
 Our Work Anywhere Agent™ model affords them the flexibility not found in the traditional workplace. It gives them the freedom to decide when, where and for whom to work. It enables them to prioritize their time to earn an income, raise a family, care for elderly parents or go to school. 
 Time and again, agents tell us what it means to live, work and succeed on their own terms: 
 
 “I can’t stress to you as a single mother the importance of this company, its vision and goals. I have been in the hospitality industry for 32 years now, and these last 10 years with WSOL have been the best. You have allowed me to create time, and more importantly, an income to be a successful person and mother.” 
 
 
 “I researched many companies trying to find a job I could work at home and still be able to take of my family. Kudos to you and your peers that have made this company what it is.” 
 
 I’m inspired when reading agent comments. They go to the heart of why we started this company. They reflect opportunity for agents, their passion for the work and belief in what we do. 
 Today, the modern, mobile workforce continues to grow. FlexJobs experienced a 26% increase in postings of telecommuting or work-from-home jobs in the past year. Add to that, industry analyst Forrester reported that 63 million American workers will be telecommuting by 2016. 
 Those are big numbers. More important, they’re even bigger validation of the value a 21st-century workplace can bring—anywhere, for anyone.
