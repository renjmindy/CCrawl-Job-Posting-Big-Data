 Bring together students, alumni and recruiters for meaningful, face-to-face conversations. 
 
 Host multiple sessions  from a single platform. 
 Mirror an in-person event with organized, secure channels that allow you to invite specific professionals, students and college staff. With Workstorm, you can design higher-touch, more impactful events that allow students and employers to reconnect afterward to continue the networking opportunity.
