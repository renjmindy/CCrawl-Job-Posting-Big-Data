 I am looking to speak to immediately available HR Project Consultants with HR/transformation and payroll experience in Birmingham city centre. 
 My client is looking for some project support on a recently launched HRIS (SAGE)and ATS, possibly also helping to procure and transition to a new outsourced payroll provider. 
 Working as part of the HR team, you will work alongside a Project Manager and help facilitate process mapping workshops and define change around HR systems, HR processes, training and system development, mapping out behaviours for employees and managers. 
 With an analytical and business mindset, you will ideally have a Shared Service background with transformation project experience around HR systems/business improvements and outsourcing contracts and service provisions. My client is looking for someone to do the mechanics of workshops, processes, developing and delivering guidance, writing comms and gluing together different processes, working with the HR Team and the HRIS provider SAGE. 
 This is a day rate contract, up to £400, until March 2020. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
