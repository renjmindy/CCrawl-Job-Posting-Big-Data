 What is a school psychologist? 
 School psychologists help children and students of all educational levels manage social, emotional, behavioral, and learning problems. They work at schools, universities, community services, and mental health institutions. 
 What does a school psychologist do? 
 School psychologists design and implement interventions for a wide spectrum of difficulties children may face, for example, performance anxiety, learning difficulties, or anger management issues. Emphasizing on students’ personal and social strengths, they encourage wellbeing and a healthier mindset. In collaboration with educational staff, they create and implement prevention programs to tackle common school problems, such as dropping out and bullying. 
 School psychologist responsibilities include: 
 
 Assessing eligibility for community support services 
 Evaluating and counseling high-risk students 
 Promoting academic achievements 
 
 School psychologist job requirements and responsibilities vary based on the characteristics of the targeted group and educational setting. For example, at colleges, career decisions can be stressful for students, so experience with career guidance is needed. Similarly, high school students can benefit from guidance when deciding which post-secondary institution to attend. 
 To craft an effective school psychologist job description, make sure to customize this template to the position at hand.
