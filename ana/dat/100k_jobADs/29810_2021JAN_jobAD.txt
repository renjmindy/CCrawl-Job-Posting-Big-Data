 Postdoc position: “Understanding large scale spatiotemporal distributions of macrozoobenthos in the Dutch Wadden Sea” 
 The department of Coastal Systems (COS) is looking for a highly motivated Postdoc. We offer a postdoctoral position of 3 years on studying the spatiotemporal variation in macrozoobenthos in the group of Dr. Allert Bijleveld. This project is part of ongoing research on understanding trends and spatial distributions of benthic communities in the Dutch Wadden Sea.

 **LOCATION:             ROYAL NIOZ TEXEL (THE NETHERLANDS) 
** **VACANCY ID:          2020 - 88 
** **CLOSING DATE:      February 14th 2021 
 ** **THE DEPARTMENT 
** The Department of COS integrates state-of-the art laboratory, field and numerical modelling studies in frontier explorations of the drivers of the dynamics of marine habitats and food webs. COS examines how physical, chemical and biological processes interact to determine the distribution, composition and productivity of marine species - from primary producers to top predators - and marine habitats - from the coast to inter/sub-tidal and pelagic environments. Research is applied at both the regional and global scales. 
 
 **THE PROJECT 
** The Wadden Sea is a UNESCO world heritage site and home to a variety of species.  Macrozoobenthos are the largest secondary producers in the food web and in turn a major food source for birds, fish and invertebrates. At NIOZ, we have a long tradition for studying the macrozoobenthos community of the Dutch Wadden Sea. 
 SIBES  **is a long-term NIOZ monitoring program of the distribution of macrozoobenthic invertebrates sampled across 1151 km 2 of intertidal mudflats. With approximately 4,800 stations sampled annually for more 13 years, SIBES is the largest and most extensive monitoring program for macrozoobenthos worldwide. **The program has compiled a large and comprehensive dataset that is now available for state-of-the-art analyses on the spatiotemporal variation in the biomass and abundance of single species as well as communities. 
 The general aim of this postdoc project is to understand the spatiotemporal distribution of macrozoobenthos in their dynamic intertidal habitat. The specific goals of the 3-yr position are open for discussion and depend on the interests and expertise of the successful candidate. 
 
 **THE CANDIDATE 
** Applicants must have a PhD degree, or aim to submit their PhD thesis for assessment by spring 2021. A background in ecology, macrozoobenthos, experience with handling large data sets, and the analysis of spatiotemporal distributions are required. Because the successful candidate will have large amounts of spatiotemporal data available, strong statistical, analytical, and computational skills are critical. The successful candidate is also expected to have good collaborative skills and proven abilities to publish and present at a high international level. 
 Preferably, the candidate starts in spring 2021. Interested applicants should submit a CV, names and contact information for 3 references, and a cover letter by February 15, 2020. The cover letter should include (1) a summary of the applicant's research and (2) their experience with macrozoobenthos and spatiotemporal data analyses, and (3) 1-3 research questions and approaches that the applicant would like to pursue with the SIBES data. We highly encourage applicants from all members of our research community and of diverse background to join us. 
 
 **CONDITIONS 
** Employment of this position at Royal NIOZ is by  NWO  (The Netherlands Organization of Scientific Research). We offer a position for a period of 3 years (fulltime). The salary is compliant to the  CAO-OI  (Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Research Institutes) scale 10 or 11 depending on your education and experience, a pension scheme, a holiday allowance of 8% of the gross annual salary, a year-end bonus of 8,3% of the gross annual salary, flexible work arrangements and 42 days of holiday leave (fulltime position). 
 You may expect attractive secondary employment conditions. We offer generous relocation expenses for employees coming from abroad and support with finding accommodation. 
 ** 
 MORE INFORMATION 
** For additional information about this vacancy, please contact  dr. A.I. (Allert) Bijleveld , scientist. For additional information about the procedure, please contact  Sigrid Moerbeek  (senior HR advisor). For more information about the Department of Coastal Systems (COS) at NIOZ, see  here.  
 Please note that by March 1 st we aim to invite suitable candidates for an interview on March 8th, 2020
