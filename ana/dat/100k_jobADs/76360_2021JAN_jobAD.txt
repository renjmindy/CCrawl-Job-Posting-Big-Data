 How many people have a job @graduation? 
 March 31, 2016 Eileen Kohan 
 On college campuses across the country it's 'conversion' time; next level marketing to the chosen to turn them into the enrolled. How do you differentiate between alternatives? If you take the commodity approach, it's all about guaranteed employment. Here's the thing - there are no guarantees. 
 It's reasonable to consider post-grad employment when you're investing a significant amount of money in a college degree. But that's what it is, an investment, not a purchase. For the student, 'attending' college is not a passive act, it's a full-time commitment. The ROI is a direct result of the effort, not dollars expended. 
 Former Cornell University president and current AAU president,  Hunter Rawlings  weighed in on the  value of college  debate last spring. 
 _" A college education, then, if it is a commodity, is no car. The courses the student decides to take (and not take), the amount of work the student does, the intellectual curiosity the student exhibits, her participation in class, his focus and determination — all contribute far more to her educational “outcome” than the college’s overall curriculum, much less its amenities and social life. Yet most public discussion of higher ed today pretends that students simply receive their education from colleges the way a person walks out of Best Buy with a television." _ 
 When you ask the question 'How many students are employed at graduation?' you're asking about the resale value of the car. 
 No one in today's job market is guaranteed work. Any individual who believes their institutional pedigree will stand alone to open career doors is delusional. 
 The level of student engagement in internships, research, community service and extra-curricular activities, combined with faculty, staff and alumni connections, are far better predictors of post-grad success than destination survey statistics. 
 The question to ask is 'What are the resources available to assist students seeking work?' The 'support' assets are the constant in a volatile job market. Access to this 'capital' is the true measure of a university's commitment to post-grad employment.
