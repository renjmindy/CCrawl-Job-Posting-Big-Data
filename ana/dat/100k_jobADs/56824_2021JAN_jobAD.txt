 Former WorkSource client now helps others find jobs 
   
 
 Stacie Manley worked at Cowlitz Public Utilities District as a Meter Reader for eight years until her job was phased out in 2014 when meters became readable electronically. After her layoff, Stacie pursued her associate’s degree at Lower Columbia College (LCC). 
 After meeting with Crystal Heitz at LCC for the worker retraining program, she was referred to Laura Vickers at WorkSource Cowlitz/Wahkiakum in Kelso. Stacie submitted a scholarship application and was awarded a scholarship through WorkSource that helped pay for her tuition and books, along with some support services. 
 During her time at LCC, Stace was on the Dean’s List and earned a certificate in management and marketing and her AA degree in Administrative Service Management. Graduating in June 2016, she began her job search and soon realized the job market was very competitive. 
 A position at WorkSource opened for an Employment Specialist and Laura encouraged her to apply. Stacie made her way through the interview process and was offered a position. She started in February 2017 and is now a case manager for ReBoot, a program that focuses on training job seekers for Advanced Manufacturing and Technology occupations.
