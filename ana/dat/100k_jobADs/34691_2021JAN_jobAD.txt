 The Staircase to the World Cup is about as Reliable as Clint Dempseys Rap Career 
 ** Daily Mail - Clint Dempsey has revealed he is releasing a rap album after the World Cup. Dempsey, who scored after 31 seconds in USA’s 2-1 win over Ghana on Monday, spent two weeks before the tournament recording a 13-track album in Los Angeles with the help of rappers and producers from his home town of Nacogdoches, Texas. The album will be called ‘The Redux’ and will be released under Dempsey’s rap name ‘Deuce’. ‘We just were having fun with it and it ended up being an album,’ Dempsey told the Wall Street Journal. ** 
 Banging G's, this is going to be great.. I have second hand embarrassment already because we all know the only G's banging out of this world cup will be the Gringos who have to travel this staircase to hell: http://youtu.be/64b_5TfUjYQ I know Brazil is the ingenuity capital of the world but c'mon man those stairs are gonna go down faster than Jozy Altidores hamstring, Landon Donovan's World Cup Hopes and simultaneously old "Dueces" rap career.
