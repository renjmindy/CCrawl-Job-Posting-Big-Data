 The Compliance Challenge of Evergreen Requisitions and Pipeline Recruiting by Lindholm, Chris | LocalJobNetwork.com 
 
 My concern is that while record keeping (particularly in hiring) is a topic that has been endlessly discussed in the public forum, the most significant problems remain, and the risk of significant cost to the contractor is still there. In fact, one of the reasons I chose to write this was not to remind people of an ongoing issue, but to make perfectly clear that with the significant expansion of record keeping requirements under VEVRAA and Section 503, I am certain the problems for contractors is on the verge of getting worse.
