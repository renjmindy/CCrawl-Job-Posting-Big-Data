 You will be a people-focused hands-on (80% in code) lead that coaches and mentors engineers to realize their full potential, striving to become the best. Your mission is to help create a tight-knit engineering org that runs like a well-oiled machine fostering a passion for creating a world-class consumer experience.

 Fostering an engineering culture of constant learning and continuous improvement 
 Championing front-end best practices while staying abreast of new trends that could benefit the team and business 
 Preparing and delivering various engineering-related presentations, both internally and externally
