 There’s no doubt about it, Matilda is one of the most iconic children’s films ever made, and Mara Wilson, the actress behind the little girl, swiftly became a household name. 
 Matilda was released in 1996 – how about that for nostalgia – and the actress who played the part was just nine years old at the time, when she was cast in the film adaptation of Roald Dahl's book. 
 Mara starred in classics Miracle on 34th Street and Mrs Doubtfire and she swiftly became a very famous child actor.

 Where is Matilda actress Mara Wilson now? 
 Mara, born in California, is now 33 years old and she has moved on from her days as a child star. 
 In a very rare TV interview, Mara recently spoke about the pressures of fame from a young age. 
 During a rare interview on Australian TV channel Today Extra, Mara said: “It hurt to hear adult critics saying things against me. It felt very unfair and very hard. There was really a lot of pressure on me, I felt, from the outside world."

 The 33 year old also spoke about working with Danny DeVito, who played her dad in the 1996 film Matilda. 
 She said it was “really wonderful,” adding that his family took her "under their wing as kind of like a second family". 
 She explained: “Danny and his wife, Rhea, they would let me come over to their house. 
 The child star celebrated turning 33 this year 
 Mara has published a book 
 "We would have sleepovers, we went to go see plays, we went to see movies. 
 "They made sure I was also being treated like a kid. I played with their kids, just like any other kids." 
 Since her days of being a child star, Mara has slipped out of the spotlight and pursued creative projects, and she released a book about what it was like being a child star. 
 The book is named ‘Where Am I Now?’ and it was released in 2016. 
 The star also penned the play Sheeple, which was produced for the New York International Fringe Festival.
