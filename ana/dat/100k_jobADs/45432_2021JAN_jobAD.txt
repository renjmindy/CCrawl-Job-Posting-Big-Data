 Job References: Sample Reference Page (with Notes) 
 By  Ronnie Ann   Leave a Comment 
 From the very first glimpse of your resume and beyond, impressions happen at every stage of the interview process. And that includes the reference list you give / send to the employer. So here's an example I created of a sample reference page you can use as a template for your own references sheet. 
 Sample Reference Page

 **This is a sample reference page owned by WorkToTheWise.com. It is meant to help you put together your own professional references page for job interviews.

 What are those notes for? 
 Although you're familiar with your work history and where your references fit into that, you want to help the reader understand quickly & easily. So I suggest adding a note under each reference to clarify who what and where. 
 This can also come in handy if your references are old or you don't want anyone at your current company contacted yet. Or if there is anything else you'd like to explain. Keep it short. But by all means help them understand what you already know. 
 A few more thoughts on references 
 If you  impressed the hiring team enough to get asked for your references , that's a really good sign. Not a guarantee of a job offer. But at least one more chance to impress them -- both with the quality of the references themselves and with the way your references page looks. 
 Often, the reference list pages I got were ok enough to serve their basic purpose. But when someone took the time and effort to make them look professional, it told me more about who they are. As a person -- and as a potential employee. (Proofread them carefully.) 
 Oh … and please make sure to check with your references for accuracy AND for their truly supportive willingness. You don't want any unhappy surprises at this point!
