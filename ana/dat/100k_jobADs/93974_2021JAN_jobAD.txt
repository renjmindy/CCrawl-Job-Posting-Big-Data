 A Funny Thing Happened During the Interview 
 Posted on  September 29, 2010  by  Wils Bell 
 A Unique Security Interview 
 During a conversation today I was reminded of a situation that in some regards was funny and on the other hand was actually rude. It does have a lesson to those employees of companies involved in the interview process. 
 Here's what happened. I had a position here in Florida for a senior hands-on technical Security candidate. The client was a solid company with operations around the USA, Caribbean and Central and South America. Even though this company had many bilingual employees due to their different business locations, it was not required on this particular position. 
 Since the candidate (let's call them Dave") I recruited was available ASAP, had recently relocated to Florida and was local, the employer scheduled an in-house interview for one afternoon. ( I'd known Dave for several years since I recruited him for another opportunity when he lived in the Carolina's. Still has his Carolina accent.) 
 The day of the interview arrived and Dave was off to meet everyone. Dave called me on his drive home from the interview to share his thoughts of the company, the position, the people, etc. He met with Human Resources and got all the HR information and was taken on a brief tour of the facility by another HR representative on the way to interview with the technical security staff and manager. Dave was taken to a conference room where the manager and 2 project managers were all waiting to conduct a group interview, even though the interview itinerary was stated differently, but no big deal. 
 Here's where it begin to get a little funny and rude at the same time. All three employees of the client were asking Dave questions related to the job. As usual, the questions started out relatively easy and progressed quickly to more difficult questions since Dave was able to answer correctly without any issues. He knew he were doing well. He knew he knew more than the project manager he would report too. He knew the manager thought he would not be challenged for long in the job. He knew he blew away all the other candidates interviewed thus far, and many other insights. 
 Now you ask, why would these employees conducting the interview discuss these comments directly in front of Dave. Simple, they were speaking Spanish. Yes they were interviewing in English, but discussing amongst themselves their comments about the candidate. How rude was that, but the fact that Dave was able to understand about 75% of the Spanish was the funny part. 
 Yes, here's someone with a Carolina accent that had a real good handle on understanding Spanish. He had worked for a firm in the past with many Latin American clients and spent 5 years travelling south and picked up Spanish enough to understand people fairly well. 
 Dave thought it was a real insightful interview situation that most people would never experience, while also being rude. 
 One we jot to the actual job, regardless of the rudeness factor, Dave stated that the client indeed had some real security issues, as I had indicted. Once those issues were resolved over the next many months, the job would not be challenging. Even though he was ready to go to work, this was not going to present a long-term opportunity. (The client still made him an offer, even though I said it was not necessary) 
 The overall problem I saw was the client was discussing Dave and his answers and comments right in front of him in a language they thought he did not understand. Whether he understood or not I felt and he felt it was rude. Would that have been the normal work environment and atmosphere. In fairness, I did share with the CIO that Dave turned down the position based on opportunity, but for future reference he night want to discuss with his managers their interview style. 
 I supposed the moral of the story would be never assume anything, like you are not being overheard or understood by those around you. 
 Have a great Wednesday.

 JOB SUMMARY 
 The real key to this position is Counterintelligence experience even though you must have Cyber Security experience also. The students to be taught are already trained in Counterintelligence, but need to be brought up to speed on Cyber Counterintelligence. 
 As an Instructor, the courses are to be fairly basic and will principally be for  familiarizing  the counterintelligence agents / students with cyber threats and the capability to deter and exploit. Under this premise, the Cyber Security experience level can be 3-5 years as long as the overall counterintelligence experience is solid and credentialed. What is needed is a candidate that can “walk the walk & talk the talk” relating to “counterintelligence” and has worked with / has experience in cyber security applications. What the client does not need is a pure computer forensics / security type individual with  no  counterintelligence. Again, (some – see below) previous counterintelligence experience is a must. 
 Client would like someone who has conducted (or closely supported) investigations of cyber threats and approaches and/or has exploited any such approach (operations). They also would be interested in anyone with a strong (3-5 years) cyber analysis background…having looked at the threats, capabilities, and patterns. 
 Counterintelligence experience through Military or Federal (FBI, etc,) service is great, but client will also look at civilians that have been /are accredited / certified in CI. 
 The ideal candidate will have 10-15 years of counterintelligence with 3-5 years cyber investigations, operations, or analytic experience. ENCASE trained. 
 The client will possibly consider 5-7 years in the  military  or  a civilian  with a technical (computer forensics / security) background  who can at least claim they are  experienced in Counterintelligence and is also ENCASE trained. 
 Specific expertise in the area of CI Force Protection, CI Investigations, CI/CE Operations and/or CI analysis is desired. 
 INSTRUCTOR DUTIES: 
 As a  Cyber Counterintelligence  (hereinafter CI)  Instructor  , you will be responsible for: 
 
 The development and delivery of training courses for Cyber CI and Information Operations. 
 Maintaining a working knowledge of the subject matter, the class dates, and any and all problems associated with delivery of training materials. 
 Coordinating with the Joint CI Training Academy (JCITA) and the military Board of Governors (BoG) and their field units to identify training requirements. 
 Ensuring course materials are maintained, updated / improved to meet current training requirements of the DOD and the Defense Counterintelligence and Human Intelligence Center (DCHC) under the supervision of the Defense Intelligence Agency DIA. 
 Routinely providing timely responses to queries and support requests from DCHC staff and military services. 
 Providing sound & accurate advice, guidance and counsel on any issues dealing with training. 
 Appropriately handling and safeguarding classified / sensitive information in accordance with applicable security directives and where needed, incorporate policy changes into the course curriculum. 
 Maintaining liaison contacts with appropriate national agencies and their officials to ensure timely exchange of training related material and information. 
 Ensuring remote learning packages/computer based training (CBT) on information operations meet the needs of field personnel. 
 Developing, preparing, and presenting briefings/lessons to students and senior level community officials. Briefings need to be clear, concise, well researched, and well organized in a logical and easy to understand fashion. Briefings and lectures need to be up-to-date, timely, adequately address the subject matter, and meet the expected level of information by the intended audience.  For consideration on this or other Security positions, please contact:
