 Be your authentic self  : For us, this means finding the intersection between what you love and what you're good at, so you can be yourself at work. 
 Set the destination, own the journey  : "Be the change you want to see in the world." Think big, speak up, take ownership. We believe in learning by experimenting and failing fast: use your creativity and resourcefulness to find solutions to problems you encounter. 
 Invite everyone to dance  : "Diversity is being invited to the party, inclusion is being asked to dance." We look for people who share our values and contribute to our culture. Diversity alone is not enough. We believe by being diverse and inclusive we make better decisions. 
 Practice heartfelt, radical candor  : We know seeking  radically candid feedback  can be hugely powerful. We proactively seek and give feedback to reveal blindspots and accelerate growth.
