 MediaMath created the first software for real-time media buying and today work with over two-thirds of the Fortune 500 and more than 3,500 brands and their agency partners. Brands and their partners use our technology and services to achieve advertising performance with less effort. We love data. When we say large amounts of data, we mean it. We receive up to 10 million advertising opportunities per second, which we run through over several internal and partner enrichments to extract many targetable properties, which we then match against 100s of thousands of advertising strategies to choose the best ad - all in less than 1/10th of a second. We also love learning and growth. From access to different learning platforms to researching new technologies, to knowledge sharing sessions and tech talks. Everyone has the opportunity to learn new technologies and work on different products and projects.
