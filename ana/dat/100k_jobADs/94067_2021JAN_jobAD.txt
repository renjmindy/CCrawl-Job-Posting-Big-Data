 This is an excellent opportunity for all the overseas workers in Hong Kong who want to work and migrate to Canada. A caregiver placement agency based in Ontario, Canada and is the only employment agency licensed by the Hong Kong Labour Board to operate in Hong Kong is seeking qualified candidates for the different nannies, caregivers, housekeepers, maids and carer jobs in Canada. These placements can be live in, live out, full time or part time but each chosen candidate will be employed on a permanent basis and will have the chance to permanently stay in Canada in the future.

 I am a Carer in the UK and have been for over 15 years - I care for one person at a time for 35 hrs per week. I am not employed in a Company - you can be a carer in the UK if the person who you care for receives a government benefit. I go to his home, and do every day things, laundry, cleaning, shopping ironing etc. I am looking to immigrate to Canada and have been told a close friend on mine can help me on the PNP programme - if she can find a family that want me to help care for somebody is that the way to approach this.
