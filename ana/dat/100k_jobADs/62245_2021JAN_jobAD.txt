  Poll: Should Politicians Spend Money on Marketing or Jobs?  
 Work It Daily 
 September 20, 2012 
 In today's economy, jobs are hard to keep and harder to find. This is something many people in America are hoping to change after the presidential election. Unfortunately, running for president requires a big bundle of cash. Presidential candidates, Obama and Romney, have  collectively spent $897.9 million dollars on their campaigns to date . That's a lot of Obama buttons and Romney signs. And if you think about it, that money could pay a fair amount of salaries if it was divided up. According to an article in The Fiscal Times,  it takes an income of $75,000 for people to happy . However, the Census Bureau recently reported that the  median income in 2011 was $50,054  in the United States. At $45,000 per person, these politicians could put 19,953 people to work for one year; and at $75,000, they could put 11,972 to work for one year. Crazy, isn't it? This would provide temporary relief for some people in desperate need of work, and it might be enough to help them get back on their feet. However, this number is minuscule compared to the millions of unemployed people in the U.S. So, how much would it actually help? And, if they truly believe they can help fix the economy, wouldn't that money be better used for their campaign? What do you think? Should they spend it on marketing or jobs? What's your take and why? [poll id="49"]
