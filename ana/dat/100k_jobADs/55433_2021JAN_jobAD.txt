 Kensington Central Library 
 Hello to you all from the staff at Kensington Central Library. We'd like to wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. If you're planning on visiting us over the holidays please check our  Christmas and New Year opening hours  first. 
 We've had another busy month so read on to find out what's been happening. 
 The Open University 
 Sandeep Dhaliwal, one of our Tri-Borough Reference Librarians blogged about  The Open University coming to Kensington Central Library  last week to deliver one of their Information Events. 
 Over to Sandeep to tell us more….. 
 The Open University Information Event on Monday 9 December at Kensington Central Reference Library 
 The Open University at Kensington Central Reference Library 
 I am pleased to say that we had 43 visitors to this event with over two-thirds attendees from West London. 
 Two of the very helpful members of staff from The Open University 
 The diverse age range of the attendees highlighted that learning is a life-long exercise – people aged in their early 20s to the over 60s came along. 
 Receiving advice from The Open University 
 If you missed this event, there is another in the new year at Chelsea Library which will take place in March 2014. 
 For more information please visit  The Open University’s website . 
 To see what other events we have check out our  What’s On page  on our website.

 New signage at Kensington Central Library 
 It's been a long time coming but we finally have some new signage in the adult lending and children's libraries. I really enjoyed working with the borough's designer and the graphics company to ensure we got the signage we needed. It was fascinating learning about fonts, types of signs and even staying late to supervise the installation. We really hope our customers find the library easier to use. 
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
 It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas….. 
 The staff have done an excellent job at decorating the library for this special time - hope you like our decorations! 
   
   
   
 We also had a very special visitor on Friday 20 December - Father Christmas made time in his busy schedule to attend our baby rhyme time. Kids and adults alike very pleased to see him and he felt like a celebrity with all the photos that were taken! 
 Father Christmas at Kensington Central Library! 
 At our last story and craft session on Saturday 21 December - the children had great fun making Christmas wreaths using paper plates, green paper and red glitter. 
   
   
 So Happy Christmas from us all!
