 EXALTED SUPREME BLISS 
 LOTS OF RESUMES SENT, NO JOB (ABE HICKS INTERPRETED)

 Love this talk. I wanna share my understanding and interpretation with you. 
 Questioner lost his job a year and a half ago. He has sent hundreds of resumes in a determined fashion, yet no job. 
 Now he knows what he wants to do with his life. The only missing ingredient is the money to do it. 
 So Abraham jokes that the only missing thing to his path of happiness and fulfillment is money. Now he needs to find the path to the money. 
 If he needs money in order to do the thing he wants to do in order to be happy, he will be looking for that his whole life. 
 The easier path is to feel happy first and then let the money and jobs and whatnot come after. 
 Simply said, his only work is to "get on the high flying disc." This means, the only work is to "get in the vortex" - which translated means the first 4 vibrations on Abraham's emotional guidance scale. 
 Feel happy right now by any means and then sustain that and the path will unfold to him in the form of inspired ideas and solutions. 
 Be happy first. Don't look to get the job or the money in order to be happy. 
 And any action taken while unhappy will yield low results. Sending 100s of resumes while feeling frustration or lack yielded him with no jobs. 
 He can use that same determination to focus on feeling happy every day. Inspired action taken from a happy emotional place yields tremendous results. 
 That is what I got out of this wonderful talk.
