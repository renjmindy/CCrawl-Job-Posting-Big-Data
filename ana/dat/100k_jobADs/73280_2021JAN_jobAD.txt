 Dear Ma’am/Sir, 
 I would like to inquire about caregiver. My name is Sheena Marie M. Villar, 23 years of age, Single. Presently residing in Bulacnin Lipa City Batangas, Philippines. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Nursing from Lipa City Colleges of the Philippines and a graduate of Caregiver in Absolute Health Science Institute which is accredited of technical Education and Skills Development Authority. 
 I have a wide range of experience in different areas such as Cashier and Healthcare. My previous salary is 12,000PHP monthly as a Private Duty Nurse. I am able to start as soon as possible. 
I am presently working as a Nursing Aide at Lipa City District Hospital. I believe that everything can be learned as long as you put your heart into it. I also learned that you should always be competent, because as long as you do not become a hindrance to someone’s growth and success, you should always give it your best shot. I am also flexible in doing any kind of work. I love working hard, this is my passion and I love to become a part of your family as a caregiver so that I can share my skills and talent. I am a God fearing person, honest and trustworthy. And I am willing to work holidays and weekends as needed. 
 I honestly did not want to leave my previous company/companies, but I am looking for a greener pasture. What I was earning was not anymore enough to meet my family’s needs. 
 I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss further information on my candidacy. I can be reached via mobile 09997317994, or by email at  sheena.villar@yahoo.com.ph 
 For your convenience, I have attached my resume for your review. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to working with you in the future. 
 Respectfully yours, 
SHEENA MARIE VILLAR
