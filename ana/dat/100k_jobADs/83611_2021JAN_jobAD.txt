 Get to where you want to be with career counselling 
 
 ​Not sure what's next or how to begin your career relaunch?  Back at work and struggling to manage it all?  Our select group of career consultants and coaches will give you the personalised support and accountability you need to get from where you are now to where you want to be at work and at home. 
 We start by identifying the key themes and setting the goals for the time we will be working together.  From there, career counselling typically takes place by Skype, phone or in person, twice a month for 90-minute sessions. Sessions are booked as a programme or in blocks of sessions usually over a period of three or six months. For clients with specific short-term goals, individual 'drop-in' sessions can sometimes be available. Each session ends with the identification of concrete and practical actions to address specific goals and issues. Between sessions, we are there to support you through email and brief phone calls as and when you 
​need us..

 Make A Smooth & Confident Return To Work 
 Maternity coaching for women currently on maternity leave or for those who have recently gone back to work, will help you make a smooth and confident transition back to work, and ensure you'll be at your best at work and at home once you get there. At the end of the coaching, you'll feel more confident and better equipped to handle any challenges that might lie ahead, and will have mapped out a clear route back to work. You'll come away with a concrete return-to-work action plan, along with a plan for your first 90 days back in the workplace so you'll be in a position to hit the ground running and start adding value right away.
