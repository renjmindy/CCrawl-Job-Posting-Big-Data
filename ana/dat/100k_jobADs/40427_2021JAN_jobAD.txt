 Jobim 
 Maria Morales  February 20, 2012 at 6:11 pm 
 I went there in 2009, it was an old big airport, however it covers all the needs for travelers; one good thing is that they have the hotel and a great restaurant, visit Rio as it is a great place to see. 
 
 Gig Airport 
 Alex Sousa  February 22, 2006 at 4:53 pm 
 I was there three months ago. The staff at GIG is very friendly. Although Rio is a relatively dangerous city, they make sure all the access routes to and from GIG are secured. Rio de Janeiro is a Marvelous place to visit!
