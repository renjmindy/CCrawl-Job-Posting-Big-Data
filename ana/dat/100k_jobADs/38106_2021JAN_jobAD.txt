 Straight to the point. My main business took a bit of a hit at the very start of the pandemic, I needed to diversify and Amazon FBA intrigued me. 
 My main business has recovered nicely and is back to normal - but I know I still need to diversify income streams. 
 I've been thinking, are there others out there who are looking to start Amazon FBA, or maybe you've just started - if so can we have a closed Telegram group where we can all start together and grow together. 
 Hit me up if you want to join. 
 Another benefit, if there are enough of us, we can all chip into one tool like Helium10 for a fraction of the $97 a month cost. 
 So far I've: 
 
 Created my own UK Ltd co. 
 Registered for VAT in the UK. 
 Registered for VAT in Germany. 
 Registered an EORI number for importing goods. 
 Sorted business bank account. 
 Automated accountancy. 
 Had the pleasure of talking to suppliers from China. 
 Imported goods. 
 Sent goods to UK fulfilment centre. 
 Sent goods to German fulfilment centre. 
 Created listing images. 
 Wrote listing copy. 
 Converted listing to German. 
 Used a bunch of tools from Jungle Scout to Helium10. 
 Sold goods. 
 Got to grips with Amazon PPC. 
 Still learning. 
 
 I know Amazon FBA is very popular, and even more so at times like these, so just seeing who is out there. 
 Please don't email me a blank thing with your CV attached, its a complete waste of time.
