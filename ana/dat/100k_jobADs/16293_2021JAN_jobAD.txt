 Latest Casino and Gambling News 
 NetEnt AB shedding jobs following merger with Evolution Gaming Group AB 
 __ Adam Morgan 
 __ December 2, 2020 
 __ Latest Casino and Gambling News ,  Gaming Industry News ,  Game manufacturers ,  Economy/Finance ,  Employment & Careers ,  Online Gambling News ,  Mergers, Acquisitions & Partnerships ,  Malta 
 Employees of  NetEnt AB  in Malta are facing an uncertain future after the online casino games developer reportedly disclosed that it intends to institute ‘a few hundred’ job cuts following its recent acquisition by  Evolution Gaming Group AB . 
 According to a Monday report from the  Times of Malta  newspaper, the Stockholm-listed firm was recently purchased by its larger compatriot as part of  an around $2.12 billion all-share deal  and is now consequently aiming to permanently shutter its live casino studio in the Maltese community of Qormi. The developer purportedly stated that the employees of this enterprise are now ‘at risk of redundancy’ and that it has already initiated the formal process to decide who it will be letting go. 
 Maltese excess: 
 NetEnt AB  employs approximately 1,000 people across the globe and reportedly announced as little as three months ago that it would be expanding its  live dealer  studio in  Malta  via the addition of  blackjack  tables. However, the newspaper detailed that numerous industry experts predicted that the firm’s acquisition by  Evolution Gaming Group AB  would trigger job losses as its new parent is already responsible for  nine such facilities  including one in the nearby Valletta suburb of  Birkirkara . 
 Alternative assistance: 
 The newspaper reported that the  Malta Competition and   Consumer Affairs Authority  approved the merger of NetEnt AB with Evolution Gaming Group AB in September while the small nation’s  Ministry for the Economy, Investment and Small Businesses  is currently said to be in discussions regarding possible replacement positions for anyone being impacted by the redundancies. Maltese officials have purportedly moreover  set up a special helpline  and are encouraging anyone who may be at risk of losing their job to immediately register with the country’s  JobsPlus  training and employment search service. 
 A statement from the Ministry for the Economy, Investment and Small Businesses reportedly read… 
 “Whilst noting the strong commitment by Evolution Gaming Group AB to its Malta operation, the government through the Ministry for the Economy, Investment and Small Businesses  has immediately started discussions with the relevant entities  to facilitate the smooth transition of employees who may be at risk of being laid off as a result of this restructuring. Further arrangements have also been done for JobsPlus to offer  a purposely set-up job match-making support service to affected persons .”
