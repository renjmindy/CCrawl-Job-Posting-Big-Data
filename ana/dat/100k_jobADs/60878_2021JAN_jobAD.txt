|   Prayer for Employment  NEW 
 by: Anonymous 
 I'm a struggling sole parent who just completed my nursing degree last December 2011. I'm having a lot of difficulty finding employment as a nurse as all facilities I've applied to require their applicants to have at least 12 months of nursing experience. I desperately need a job as being an unemployed sole parent is so difficult and I've worked hard to earn my degree, hoping to alleviate my family's situation. Please help me with my prayer request. Thank you so much.

 by: Job Encouragement 
 Hi everyone, 
 I've been blessed by the lord above who gave me this path to explore for his purpose. I am currently an HR Specialist/Recruiter. As much as I wish I could just give jobs to everyone, I can't. So I'm here to offer my help and advice to any of you who need interviewing tips, resume/cover letter questions, and the entire job hunting package. Don't worry, my help is completely FREE. I'm doing this because I love what I do and I'm here to help anyone who needs my help. I've set up an e-mail account specifically for those of you who have questions. Please feel free to e-mail me at Jobencouragement85@gmail.com 
 Please don't be discouraged and keep praying because the lord loves you all and is listening. :) 
 Sincerely, 
 Anna

|   Need a job as soon as possible.  NEW 
 by: Anonymous 
 I pray and tell myself to hold on tightly to my Faith, that the Lord knows what I've been going through. I pray the Lord will guide me to places of opportunity I have never thought possible. Patience is what I know is needed. At times when you need something so badly patience is needed. I am feeling awful disappointment. I need employment as soon as possible. I keep praying, don't give up, hold on strong to your Faith and soon the Lord will lead me to a place back into the working world.

I just want to take time out to say Thank You God!!! I pray that I God will allow me to work again. I have unemployed for 5 months now and becoming extremely frustrated with the process. I am walking on faith and not by sight because I believe in God and I know all things are possible thru Christ Jesus. I pray that he will allow his will and purpose to be fulfilled in my life and that he will open door for me that need to be opened. Also Lord Jesus I pray for all the other people that have left comments on this page and may you bless them and answer their prayers as well. We all need God in our lives to be alright. I love you Jesus and I know that you died on the cross so I may be saved. Thank you for the sacrifice. I am asking God for a huge miracle in my life now thru various trajedies I have suffered great and now I am waiting for the blessing that God has for me. I am going to Thank God in advance because I believe that I am a child of God and he wants to do marvelous things in my life and restore what the enemy has stolen from me. God Bless Everyone.
