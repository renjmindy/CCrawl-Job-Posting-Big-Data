  New Career: Starting Over Is Never An Option  
 J.T. O'Donnell 
 October 31, 2012 
 In my group coaching sessions inside CareerHMO, a common complaint from job seekers when it comes to contemplating a  career change  is, “I don't want to start over." To which I say, “That's okay, because you NEVER start over." Don't be fooled into giving up dreams of a  new career  for this reason. It's simply not true. Watch this video to learn why you never have to start over. I also explain what you do need to do to make the change. A  new career  is possible – but it's up to you to connect-the-dots. Watch this video to learn how. 
 Your Next Step 
 If you are struggling to stay positive and motivated in your job search, then I suggest you watch all four videos from my new job search training. This video series is  100% FREE  and designed to help you understand what's going wrong in your job search. I created this resource for the average job seeker, especially those who've been unemployed for more than nine months. Click the button below to receive instant access to my training.
