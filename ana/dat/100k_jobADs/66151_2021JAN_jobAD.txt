 Hospital job for our very own Mark Edgell!!! 
 Posted on  June 30, 2012  by   Rik 
 Dear Rotherham Politics Readers, 
 It was with a sense of disappointment, but not disbelief that I read this recent article in the "Star" -  http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/health/hospital-job-for-ex-council-boss-1-4679759 
 It seems there's no limit to the extent to which Rovrum's Corn Fed Grunters, Muppets and Clowns will put both feet into the civic trough to find an easy feed at taxpayer expense. Not for them a lowly-paid hard-working job, no way Comrade, no way at all. 
 I would be interested, overjoyed and full of happiness to find out just what special talents, abilities, lifes experiences and commitments this latest drain on the public purse will bring to the Board of Rotherham Hospital Foundation Trust. 
 We must be getting pretty desperate to be taking on such parachute champions. 
 Kind Regards, 
 Grald-Hunter

 Deep-joy! 
 Great news if you are about to be admitted to RDGH, a former RMBC Leader, now working for the Local Government Association and a Non-Executive Director at Magna, the executive board will run rings round him. 
 I have absolutely no confidence that he will be able to challenge the overpaid board directors on matters such as their poor survival rates for Colorectal Cancer, frontline cuts in medical and nursing staff and their systematic vandalism of community based services. 
 The directors spend more time debating the style of leather seats in their new NHS funded company cars than they do discussing patient care and safety. 
 Looking at the background of the trusts Non-Executive Directors I thought it couldn’t get any worse it just has.

 Edgell said: “I have a deep commitment to Rotherham and am passionate about helping local people to enjoy high quality public services.” 
 Er, is that a similar "commitment" to the one where he previously committed hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of local peoples' money, to funding the Supertram consultants to produce a scheme that had no credibility or substance and which was exposed and ridiculed ceaselessly and remorselessly by the residents of Bramley, Wickersley, Brecks and Whiston. And which was back heeled by the Government as a result of the exposure of his inept aspirations? 
 Is that really the quality of person, the local people of Rotherham deserve? 
 Readers might recall also, that it's only a few months since Edgell's mates at Rotherham Council were exposed by a local resident, whereby they were intending to relieve the hospital of a huge wedge of patient funding, just so the hospital could be granted planning permission to build a desperately needed car park. 
 Well my goodness, it's going to interesting to monitor Edgell's loyalties over the tenure of his 'non-executive directorship'.

 "I have a deep commitment to Rotherham and am passionate about helping local people to enjoy high quality public services.” 
 Did he get this off the "how to write a CV" website? If he's so passionate, then he should resign from the post and make sure the money is used for something useful. How is it possible that this kind of cronyism is still rife in Rotherham?

 'please confine your comments to the ‘New Labour’ as led by that lying, thieving, warmongering waste of space, Tony B liar.' 
As opposed to the Hamas and Castro supporting ill dressed Marxist Supreme Leader of the Labour party Corbyn who has never uttered one word of rebuke to RMBC for the sloppy way they tried to cover up CSE or refuse to suspend a convicted sex pest from the chamber? 
 You obviously think Corbyn has improved the Labour party. 
Read and understand this: 
 http://order-order.com/2016/12/06/two-thirds-union-members-think-corbyn-badly/#disqus_thread 
While you digest the information ask yourself why the Labour candidate only managed to persuade 3% of the voters in Richmond last week? (In a Remain stronghold)

 The attitude to Castro has little to do with politics. He's lauded and condemned from both sides. I think he was a monster, but everyone is entitled to his/her opinion no matter how stupid it might be, 
Sex pests in the chamber? Has any party got off its arse and done … anything? 
I suppose you're one of those elitist cocks that think an MP shouldn't be seen in The House unless wearing a morning suit and a top hat. Idiot. 
Richmond? You win some, you lose some. It's as if leaving the field to the Lib Dems that believe Socialism is wrong wouldn't give the wrong impression. 
I've lived in the Rotherham area for nearly all my 66 years and seen it rise to heights under Labour and sink to lows under New Labour (also known as Tory Lite). 
 In passing: That argument about Jeremy Corbyn;s lack of popularity is a lie spread by those who would have ousted him for being left wing. They prefer their snouts in the trough and wish to ignore his OVERHWELMING mandate from the voting membership who backed him the first time and gave him a larger majority after the ill considered vote of 'no confidence'. Obviously led by those whose snouts would be lifted from that trough and forced to actually represent the populace rather than just lining their pockets.

 Mr Sylvester has been in more parties than Da Dodger's done junkets, and he's had more cap badges than Field Marshal Bernard L. Montgomery. 
 In one sense Mr Sylvester must be the most experienced and unsuccessful politician in Rovrum's entire history - "most experienced" as he's been a member of most, and "unsuccessful" as he ain't yet found a permanent political roost in which to bed down. 
 He is though, by virtue, a deeply passionate Rovrum resident, voter and ratepayer who cares about the appalling state of the sty which Rovrum's Corn Fed Grunters, Muppets and Clowns have created down at Town Hall Towers.

 Mark Edgell cheers Michael. hadnt seen this. Thanks for your comments. There are some sad people about, who know so little (as far as i can see the appointment was made by the governors not the union backers of labour, plus it's difficult to parachute into Rotherham when you already live here!!!). Hope you had a good night out on Saturday, sorry I couldnt have been there, see you soon13 hours ago 
. 
 Michael Sylvester No worries have tried getting some reasoned debate going on this site but crashed and burned so far2 hours ago via Mobile.

 CAS, Michael Sylvester, Mark Edgell et-al, 
 Ho ho ho ho ho, he he he he he, you can be sure that Town Hall Towers and RMBC Elected Members and Officers aren't as tight as GCHQ - you are surrounded by spies, informants, snouts, traitors and also those with an eye for an opportunity to humiliate and ridicule you … 
 Praise Be To The Almighty for the power of the internet to inform active and empowered citizens across Rovrum who no longer have to rely on sanitised versions of what's going on a la "Rovrum News" with its bouncing babbiz stories and wall-2-wall smiles and gud newz storiz. 
 We're watching yaz and we're listening in …

Err, yes and no. He has not got an overwhelming mandate from the voters has he? It is the electorate who decides which party should form a government not 250,000 signed up members meeting in halls planning and plotting the People's Revolution. 
 Don't refer to me as an 'Idiot', it is a sign you're losing the plot. 
 'Sex pests in the chamber? Has any party got off its arse and done … anything?' 
If you read this forum regularly and correctly you would know Cllr. Allen Cowles has proposed a motion calling for Roddison to be suspended. 
 Before you break into a sweat pounding your keyboard the next time you read a comment you disagree with do more research and learn to moderate your language, it saves me having to embarrass you.
