 Not Sure You Have a Disability? 
 What is a disability? 
 A disability is defined as an impairment that may be physical, cognitive, mental, sensory, emotional, developmental, or some combination of these. It may be present from birth or occur during a person’s lifetime, affecting a person’s communication, mobility, self-direction, self-care, work skills, or work tolerance. 
 Ask yourself: Do I have a condition that may be considered a disability? 
 Have you ever… 
 
 had special education or content mastery assistance in school? 
 had difficulty finding a job because of needing help to fill out an application? 
 had difficulty with any of the following at a previous job?
 
 not learning tasks quickly enough 
 being overwhelmed with work demands 
 difficulty staying focused 
 difficulty getting along effectively with others 
 
 
 had physical difficulties that made it hard to tolerate a full work day? 
 had a vision impairment that made it difficult to navigate in the workplace? 
 had a hearing impairment that made it difficult to communicate and/or receive information from others? 
 
 These are only some common issues that individuals experience due to having disabilities; it is not a full listing of impairments. If you feel that any of the above statements may apply to you, feel free to contact us. We will be happy to provide you with additional assistance.
