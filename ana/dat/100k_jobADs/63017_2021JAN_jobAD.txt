 P&G's London Olympic Mom Clip 
 As any long-time reader knows, we are  huge fans  of the  Oympics  in these parts. I had a friend who once joked that the only sport Mrs. Yeti and I watch is  "Olympics" , and he wasn't far off. We might not watch football or baseball, but every couple of years we burn the hell out of our Tivo taping every  event  we can during the  Olympics . 
 And with the  Opening Ceremonies  set to take place this Friday in  London , well, we've been fools for anything  Olympic-related  for weeks now. So, when I caught an airing of the American-Mom only version of this new ad from Proctor & Gamble, I cried my ass off and thought it was brilliant. 
 But, then I found this International-Mom clip and, well, I haven't stopped crying yet. It really is advertising gold. So beautiful! The only thing that would make it better was if they had one for Dad's too. Enjoy and see you at the games!
