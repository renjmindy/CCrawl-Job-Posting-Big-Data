 Careers Week 
 July 3, 2017  |  onyxclass 
 Last week in school was Careers Week. We had lots of special visitors to our classroom over the week.  Can you remember who came? 
 First we had a visit from the PCSOs (Police). They came to have a play in the classroom and see what we do in Foundation Stage Two. It was fun to be able to play with all the toys in Onyx classroom together. Then we talked to them and they told us all about being in the Police and how you get to be in the Police. Some of us want to be in the Police when we are older. 
 Then Miss Parker's mum came to visit us. We are used to seeing her in the School Library but not in our classroom. She came to tell us all about when she was a Librarian at the University. Did you know librarians have to go to Library School? They also have to read a LOT of books. If you love books maybe you could be a Librarian one day. 
 Finally Miah's mum came to visit us and tell us about her job in a Care Home. She has to work very hard and told us all about the different jobs she has to do to help keep the old people happy and safe. She came to see us in her special uniform so we could see it. 
 A huge thank you to everyone who came to talk to us about their job.  What would you like to do when you grow up?  Maybe you could draw a picture and bring it to show Miss Parker in class.
