 I Don't Have a Five-Year Plan 
 Published on  January 8, 2018January 6, 2019  by  Brandi Leave a comment 
 From the time students start high school they are expected to know what they want to do for the rest of their lives. They are encouraged to choose a "track" or program for the rest of high school to help shape their future education and career. The problem I find with this is that  life is always in flux . 
 When I started college, I knew exactly what I was going to do with my life. Little did I know that three and a half short years later I would be married and on a completely different career path than I went in with (and the journey that I took to get there wasn't a straight shot either). We can make plans all we want, but education and experiences can change things. 
 Because of this, in my life I choose to make  tentative plans over concrete plans . When it comes to the future, my husband and I typically lay out how we could  see  things going while including alternate possibilities and keeping in mind that things could change completely. For example, when we have kids, we aren't sure if we are going to home school or if our children will attend a public school, but we have tentative plans for both. This is important because  if you set your heart on something turning out a certain way and it doesn 't happen, you will be crushed. 
 But what about God's will? I think that in some instances God may have a very specific plan, or specific door, that He intends for us. Other times, however, I think that we have a wide array of doors to choose from, but our attitude is the key. Colossians tells us that no matter what we do, we are to do it in the name of the Lord. I feel that that gives us some freedom in choosing what we do. Want to be a teacher? Do it as if working for the Lord. Want to be a welder? Do it as if working for the Lord. Want to be a business owner? Do it as if working for the Lord. 
 So, for me, there's no five-year plan. I have goals, hopes, and dreams for my career and my family, yet I trust that if the Lord has a specific plan for me I will find it and follow in faith. If He doesn't, I will still treat whatever it is as my calling and do it for the Lord, because  God 's will is sometimes a specific plan, but it's  always  an attitude. 
 With love,
