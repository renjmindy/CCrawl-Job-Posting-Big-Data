 EXPANDING THE UTILIZATION OF TECHNOLOGY TO ASSIST BUSINESSES AND JOB SEEKERS 
 As the Central Arkansas Workforce Development Area (CAWDA) continues to expand services on various virtual platforms, in November 2017, CAWDA began utilizing INDEED, an employment search engine for job listings, to continue efforts of finding qualified applicants for employers who have sought assistance through the Business Service Team and other partners. 
 Surprisingly, in November and December 2017 alone, over 1,000 job seekers submitted applications for various listed job opportunities. As a result, the Business Service Team implemented new strategies to use INDEED as a primary source to assist with the promotion of available job opportunities in Central Arkansas. 
 Furthermore, to date, over 3,350 applications have been received by using various online platforms and INDEED has contributed 2,005 of those applications.
