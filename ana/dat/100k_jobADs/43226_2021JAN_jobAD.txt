 The Company 
 BenevolentAI unites technology with human intelligence to re-engineer drug discovery and deliver life-changing medicines. We have developed the Benevolent Platform®, a drug discovery platform built on powerful data foundations with state of the art machine learning and AI technology. Our technology empowers scientists to decipher the vast and complex code underlying human biology, find new ways to treat disease and personalise medicines to patients. Benevolent has active in-house R&D drug programmes in disease areas such as neurodegeneration, immunology, oncology and inflammation and has research and commercial collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and research organisations. 
 The company is headquartered in London with a research facility in Cambridge (UK) and a further office in New York. 
 Who we are 
 We are an eclectic bunch at Benevolent, united by our belief that innovative thinking and purposeful technology can truly change outcomes for the better. Our mission is to re-engineer drug discovery and deliver life-changing medicines for patients in need and we do this by applying AI, machine learning and other advanced technologies to reinvent the ways drugs are discovered and developed. We strive to bring together unique skills and perspectives across biology, chemistry, engineering, AI research, informatics, precision medicine and drug discovery. 
 The Role 
 We are looking for a number of enthusiastic and motivated drug discovery scientists to join our In Vitro Biology team focusing on novel target identification, assay development and screening. You will contribute to our technology-enabled drug discovery programmes, from hit identification through to pre-clinical. As a central member of a dynamic, multi-disciplinary team of scientists passionate about reinventing the way new medicines are developed, you will bring your understanding of in vitro biological technologies and drug discovery to progress projects into clinical evaluation. 
 Primary Responsibilities 
 
 Identify and establish relevant in vitro assays for target identification and validation projects. Perform screens with small molecules or genetic approaches (siRNA, shRNA, CRISPR). 
 Develop and optimise relevant biochemical or cell-based assays for medium to high throughput screening of novel therapeutic compounds to support pipeline projects. 
 Maintain cell cultures including cell lines, primary cells and/or iPSCs. 
 Generate detailed SOPs and follow assay protocols. 
 Critically analyse and interpret data, define realistic timelines for studies and meet delivery deadlines to execute high impact studies. 
 
 We are looking for someone with 
 
 BSc, MSc or equivalent in biological sciences or a closely related discipline. Industry research experience is preferred but not required. 
 Ability to work independently. 
 Attention to detail. 
 
 Nice to haves -  we have several openings and experience with one or more of the below would be desired but not required. 
 
 Experience with cell lysis, cellular fractionation, co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. 
 Experience with RNA extraction, qPCR, RNAseq workflows and data analysis. 
 Experience with in vitro plate-based biochemical assays and technologies (absorbance, fluorescence, TR-FRET, luminescence, etc). 
 Experience with a range of cellular assays and technologies (ELISA, MSD, reporter gene, high content & live-cell imaging, flow cytometry). 
 Experience working in cell culture with immortalised cell lines, primary cells, iPSCs, primary tissue and complex cultures (co-cultures or 3D cultures). 
 Familiarity with electronic lab notebooks. 
 
 Together, we envision a world in which no disease goes untreated. If you are benevolent, curious, want to tackle real world problems and are willing to embrace new ideas, hit that ‘apply’ button and join us.
