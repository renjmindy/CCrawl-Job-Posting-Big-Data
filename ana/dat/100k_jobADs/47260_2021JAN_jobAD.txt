 Job Description  : 
 Caregiver jobs are for individuals who are qualified to care independently for children, the elderly or people who have physical or mental disabilities. There is a shortage of Canadians who are available to work in live-in Caregiver jobs. In order to keep up with such a demand a live-in Caregiver Program was developed to bring qualified foreign people who are available to work on a live-in basis.
