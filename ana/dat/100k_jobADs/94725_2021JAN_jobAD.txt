 Starting Your Career as a Freelance Writer Book Review 
 From an outside perspective, working as freelance writer seems like a dream, especially when one is burnt out by their nine to five job. But for anyone who dreams of leaving the nine to five job for freelance writing, there is a reality to the professional and quite a few details that need to be taken into consideration before one takes the plunge. 
 The 2016 book,  Starting Your Career as a Freelance Writer , written by Moira Allen lays out in simple terms every aspect of the professional life of a freelance writer. The book details subjects such as submitting pieces to publishers, completing research, the best method to copyright your work and handling the financial aspect of working for yourself. 
 I picked this book up on a whim from my local library and I am so glad that I did. I am the one of millions of freelance writers who would love to write for a living, but also needs a steady income. I learned a lot from this book and I recommend it, especially for those would love to ditch their current job and earn their living by their pen.

 This hobby blog is dedicated to movie nerdom, nostalgia, and the occasional escape. In the late 90s, I worked at Blockbuster Video where they let me take home two free movies a day. I caught up on the classics and wrote movie reviews for Denver 'burbs newspapers and magazines. Today, I continue to revisit the old and discover the new on the screen. Comments and dialogue are highly encouraged. This year, I'm excited to collaborate with other writers via SLICETHELIFE in which we will share our movie genre favorites in our 2021 Movie Draft!
