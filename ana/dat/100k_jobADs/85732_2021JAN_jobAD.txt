 Lead Developer/ Software Architect 
 About Security Phoenix: 
 2-7% shares, plus compensation (salary) and YoY raise based on performance (shares & salary) 
 Security Phoenix is a cybersecurity start-up that is working on an exciting new product. You will be working on our new product Security Phoenix that is disrupting the world of vulnerability management and application security. We are looking for a candidate who wants to work in a very dynamic and flexible way. 
 Security Phoenix helps CIO/CTO/CISO and developers talk the same language when it comes to vulnerability management. The Security Phoenix platform enables a clear view on vulnerabilities and contextualization of those in applications with enriched information like the cost of the application and risk in relation to the importance level of the application. The platform is extending its data source and applying data science to enable inference and suggestion for clients. 
 The team has already 3 experience developers (frontend, 2x backend), and 3 junior full stacks (2x fronted focus, 1 backend). We are looking to add a lead with a strong vision on the product and architecture. 
 Key requirement: 
 
 Cloud Focus 
 Container focus 
 Data focus 
 Some cybersecurity experience is a + but not a must 
 
 We don't work in a traditional way. Fully remote, fully distributed, fully around you. We are delivery based and working around your life rather than the other way around.
