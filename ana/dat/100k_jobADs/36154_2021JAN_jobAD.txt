 Wednesday WOW: NC Sheroes; "Moving Forward" 
 Posted on  March 24, 2016  by   QC SuperMom 
 Reply 
 Sometimes Sheroes are right in our back yard! They are the ones that get up everyday, no matter what's going on at home, in their mind, or in their account and make it happen. No excuses , no delays- they are unselfishly walking in their calling and impressing the world one day, move, and thought at a time. 
 You may or may not know their names, or ever spoken to them, but you've seen them or results of their incredible work. They are "Sheroes; Moving Forward!" 
 On April 2nd, at 11″30 am, We will honor our sheroes by resting their capes and revealing why they are so bold, brave and unstoppable! 
 In honor of Women’s History Month, the Charlotte Mecklenburg Public Library presents NC SHEROES "Moving Forward!" 
 THIS IS OUR 2nd year celebrating with MomsRising NC and my moms group Queen City Stay At Home Moms. 
 We will honor 6 amazing women, who have made significant contributions to the Women's movement right here in North Carolina. 
 After an introduction, we will award each Shero. Then go into a Round-table. Come prepared to find out why women matter and should be empowered to have a voice! Bring a child with you. It's lessons like these that stick with them! 
 Here is our impressive line up! 
 Tawanna Ross- Award wining Gospel Hip Hop artist 
 Asha Sims- Gentle Yoga  instructor 
 Melody Gross- Doula 
 Nadine Ford - Farmer/gardener 
 Cassie Pressley- Teen Vegan Baker 
 Tina B. - Social activist 
 Special Guest TBA later. 
 Sweet Right?! We'll see you there! This ceremony is complete with refreshments! So don't worry about stopping for breakfast. And …Yes bring the kids, we'll have a station for them to entertain themselves need be.

 Wednesday Wow: Mama's, Let's Make Some Bread At Home

 If you recall, last week, I began telling you about opportunities to really make money while being a stay at home and work from home mom. This week I'm actually giving you links and other resources to help you stress less, bring something to the table and build your self esteem. These suggestions do not work for everyone. They all require real work and are free to begin.I am personally knowledgeable of each point below. So please click on the links. Also note that because I do, it doesn't mean I'm a member of each of them. ( Personally I would never sign up for a program that charge me anyway)
