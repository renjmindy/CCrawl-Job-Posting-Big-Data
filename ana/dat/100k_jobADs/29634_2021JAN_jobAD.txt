 Steve Jobs: How to Live Before You Die 
 August 21, 2012December 28, 2018  /  Kurt M Borne 
 If you haven't seen it yet, " Steve Jobs' 2005 commencement address at Stanford University " is definitely worth a look. Below are some of his memorable quotes on the subjects of connecting the dots of your life, loving your work, and living your own life. 
 " You can't connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking backwards. You have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something. Your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well-worn path, and that will make all the difference." 
 _ "You've got to find what you love… Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do."_ 
 _ "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary."_
