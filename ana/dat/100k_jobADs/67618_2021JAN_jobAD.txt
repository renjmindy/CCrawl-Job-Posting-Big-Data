Related:   5 Fabulous Career Paths For Creative Minds  If you’re a creative person and your job isn’t ticking all of your boxes, consider a creative career move – one that allows you to express yourself, explore new and creative concepts and most importantly is something that you enjoy. Whether you decide to work for a company or choose to go your own way and do something part-time to tide you over. Here are a few options. Working in the world of copywriting is a fantastic way to dip your toes in to a myriad of industries, learn things you never thought you would and also hone your creative and communicative skills. Whatever your writing experience, so long as it’s high quality and works for the client it doesn’t matter if you didn’t pass high school or if you’re educated to degree level.

 Blogging And Vlogging 
 In a world where social media has somehow squeezed its way into every minute of our lives, doing it professionally is now a viable way to make a living. Do it right, you could be paid hundreds, sometimes thousands, in advertising. Companies will pay you to review or feature their product – or you can get to keep it. Developing a following will take time, so don’t quit your job straight away to become a blogger - It will take patience, perseverance, and passion. The great thing about blogging and vlogging is those who have a successful following are talking about things that they love. Meaning that, once you become a success, you will be getting paid for doing something you love and what’s more, you will be your own boss. So, whether your passion is fashion, gaming, food or film, get tweeting, instagramming, and blogging and see where you can take your interests. If you’re looking for your career change because you’re fed up of slaving behind a computer, then consider a more hands-on role. Think of jobs that don’t keep you chained to the dreaded desk, if you’re an outdoorsy kind of person, the below careers could be for you. 
 Photography 
 If you’re always snapping pictures and are constantly thinking up ideal Kodak moments, then maybe a career in photography is one for you. The key to becoming a successful photographer is a killer portfolio that expresses creativity, individuality, and the ability to market yourself. Whether you decide to do it part-time or full-time, there are plenty of photography opportunities out there. Get it right, and you could be paid to travel the world, taking powerful photos being artistic and in some extremes, changing lives. Whatever field of photography you decide to move into, remember that if you work hard enough anything can be yours. 
 Landscape Architecture 
 If you love the outside and want to be creative but also have a technical, scientific brain, this could be the career move for you. Moving into this field of work combines art, science, design and the environment. Landscape architecture is essentially the design and planning of environments in public places such as parks, industrial sites, and housing developments. Unlike the above, becoming a landscape architect requires formal education; if you already have a degree studying to become a qualified landscape architect, it will take around two years. Landscape architects in Norfolk, from  Paul Robinson Partnership  explain that an ideal candidate would need to blend creative flair with practical skills and should combine skills in IT and CAD programs. Becoming a landscape architect is a great option if you want to combine your creativity with your passion for design and the outdoors. Remember, if you’re not happy in your current career, you always have the power to change it. If you want to be more creative, there are plenty of roles out there. Even if they are only part-time they will help to meet your creative needs and give you more experience for when you are able to take the career leap.
