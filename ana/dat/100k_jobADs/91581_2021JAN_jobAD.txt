 The Volkswagen Foundation is committed to the realization of equal opportunities in the area of science and higher education. Up to now only few outstanding female scientists do assume leading positions; too often it is still unnecessarily difficult to attain balance between work and family life. But science and society cannot afford to renounce the input and ideas of highly skilled academics, be they men or women. 
 Accordingly, since 2009, the Foundation for example offers to finance a childcare allowance; changes to the project progression due to pregnancy or parental leave are always dealt with flexibly. 
 An overview of the Foundation’s offers to facilitate the combination of career and family is provided by the "Information on Family-Related Benefits” (see: Downloads). If the individual situation requires other forms of support, the respective program managers will be glad to assist.
