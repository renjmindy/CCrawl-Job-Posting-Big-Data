 All your job information in one place 
 Your jobs, at a glance 
 WorkflowMax lets you track and record every detail on every job so that you have one single source of truth. Locate jobs in seconds, along with everything else you need to know about them. 
 Gain efficiencies by using the inbuilt task manager 
 You can allocate staff to tasks and then give them a checklist of to-dos, estimated task times and due dates so everyone knows what they're meant to be working on and for how long. 
 Schedule work to manage staff capacity and meet milestones 
 WorkflowMax lets you assign start and finish dates for jobs and for every task on those jobs. You can also create other milestones independent of project and task due dates. Quickly and easily adjust all of these milestones, dates and deadlines in the schedule manager, and run reports on them. 
 Use recurring jobs to reduce your admin time 
 The recurring jobs feature enables you to automatically create a new job in your job manager on a recurring basis, complete with appropriate start and due dates, job name, job template, job category, job state, description and assigned staff. Setting recurring jobs is great if you do repetitive work for the same client on a regular basis. 
 Capacity planning made easy 
 The staff capacity planning feature can give you an at-a-glance view of how much work individual staff members have been allocated. You will easily see where there are gaps or overloads in the upcoming work schedule. 
 Never miss another deadline 
 Get an overview of all your jobs and apply one or multiple filters as needed. Choose to view by deadline, job state, important dates or staff allocation. See start and finish dates plus job 'percentage complete'. Track milestones and get notifications so you have an accurate picture of upcoming deadlines.

 How we helped 
 Got questions? We have answers! 
 Some of our customers want to be able to view progress on their jobs by logging into our WorkflowMax account. Is this possible? 
 Yes it is. The client portal lets your customers log in to WorkflowMax to see information about their jobs. You decide what information they see. Of course they can't see any job financial information. 
 I need to track every minute of my staff’s time, including internal meetings, annual and sick leave, etc. How do I do this? 
 You can track non-billable time to one or more ‘internal’ jobs. For example staff will record timesheets against a task called ‘Sick Leave’ on an internal job called ‘Internal Job - All Staff Leave’ (or similar). This means that you can record and accurately report on every minute that you pay every staff member right across the entire year. WorkflowMax gives you fantastically valuable insight into where your biggest investment is going. 
 I never want to ever lose any information about any job ever again. Even if it was completed years ago. How can I achieve this? 
 WorkflowMax stores all information you enter.  Data is never deleted, unless you ask us in writing to delete it or until you delete it yourself.  Even if you close your account and stop paying us, we will retain all your data, according to local legal requirements, as a minimum. And you will still be able to access it again at any time - just ask. 
 If I estimate that it will take 10 hours to complete a task, can I get an alert when the number of actual hours recorded against that task gets close to, or equals 10 hours? 
 Absolutely. You can set up custom notifications to let you know when the actual time against a task has reached (say) 75% of estimated hours, and another when it reaches (say) 100%. You choose how many notifications you want, and the percentages. 
 I get lots of job related emails, many with attachments, that I need to link to the job so that I can easily find them again. How would I do this? 
 Easy. WorkflowMax owns the domain name  ‘emailmyjob.com’. This means that you can  create your own unique email address for your own WorkflowMax account. For example, if your business is called Abacus Projects, you can set up your email address to be abacusprojects@emailmyjob.com. Simply forward, copy or blind copy any email to this address, add the job number into the subject line, and the email and any attachments will automatically be attached to the 'Notes' and 'Documents' tabs on the job in WorkflowMax.  Brilliant! 
 I need to understand my staff capacity so I can manage my workload better. And understand if I need to take on more work. Or staff. Is this possible? 
 Absolutely. As long as you allocate staff to tasks, add estimated time and deadlines for those tasks, WorkflowMax calculates staff capacity and displays it in a tabular format.
