 Here's a little secret about the Internet, what you do online everybody can see. That doesn't sound like a secret, but you'd be surprised how many people act like it is. That everybody isn't limited to your friends or to your social group, it includes future potential employers, loan officers, etc. It's important to be aware of that when you're posting online. Go through this presentation from SlideShare for a lot of good advice at your own pace. Highlights include have separate accounts for work and play and periodically check to see what you've put online because you might not remember and what other people have put online about you. Have you searched for yourself lately?
