 Web Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Job Description 
 A web startup client recently asked me for a CTO job description to paste into a business plan. Eager to oblige, I googled "Web CTO job description" and "web chief technology officer" anticipating it would take me five minutes to find what my client wanted. You'd think there would be a adequate boilerplate job description somewhere on the Net. But no, there's no sharable, standard description of the work we do to run a web startup. 
 Here, then, is my first draft of a job description for the work I've done as a chief technology officer for web startups. You can find the entire article here:  Job Description for a Web Chief Technology Officer (CTO). 
 After you've read the article, if you have anything to add or refine, you can leave a post, and I'll update the article.
