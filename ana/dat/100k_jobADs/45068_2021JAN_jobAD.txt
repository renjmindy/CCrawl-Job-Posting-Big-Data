We make it incredibly cheap and easy for anyone to take payments online using the Direct Debit infrastructure. Our industry-beating pricing (1% up to a maximum of Â£2), easy payment collection (we automate reconciliation into your accounts) and instant online sign-up mean that we are rapidly becoming the preferred online direct debit option for businesses. We are a rapidly-growing, highly technical team based in London. Combining years of financial services experience with a customer-driven approach, we are transforming online payments and the direct debit industry. We are sponsored by RBS (Royal Bank of Scotland) and regulated by the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority).
