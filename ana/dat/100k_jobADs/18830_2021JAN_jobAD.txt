 Are you looking to work for a fast-paced logistics provider? My client's looking for a high performing individual to join as Carrier Manager, based in Wolverhampton paying up to £45,000. 
 You will join a growing logistics provider and own the relationships between the company and their carrier partners. You'll work strategically with all carrier and linehaul service providers, dealing with logistics partners on a face to face basis ensuring the highest service levels are always maintained. 
 You will be responsible for nurturing and developing existing relationships with logistics partners and will work collaboratively to offer new logistics solutions as and when required. The business is always striving to ensure the highest levels of customer satisfaction and as part of your remit you will be tasked with removing any cost and identifying business improvements across a range of processes and procedures. 
 You will ideally have experience of working within a final mile logistics distributor or a linehaul supplier, or within an in-house logistics team dealing with end-to-end carrier management. You will conduct regular supplier reviews and will use data to analyse performance via Excel and will have access to a fully integrated CRM system to produce weekly and monthly service reports for both internal and external use. You will work with your suppliers to plan for additional volumes at peak, ensuring consistent service levels at the busiest times of year. 
 The Carrier Manager role is based at my client's site in Wolverhampton, paying a salary of £40,000 to £45,000 plus benefits. 
 Please apply with your CV, or for additional information or a confidential discussion, please call Phil Birch on 07970 211517. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
