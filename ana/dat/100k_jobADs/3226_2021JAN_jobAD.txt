 Why Do You Do What You Do?

 Why? A simple question using only 3 letters and a question mark. In this case, the, 'why?' refers to whatever it is you do in your work or professional life. Of all the jobs and careers which exist in our world, why do you do what you do? 
 Some people don't think about this a great deal. They work at the job they do because it's a family business, it's what they went to school for, or it pays the bills. In some cases, there are those that don't want to think about why they do what they do because they aren't proud of their job, they feel trapped in a job they hate, or telling others what they do just opens up discussions they'd rather not have. 
 You know what I find extremely interesting? Almost all the people I interact with who have no job at all think a great deal about why they'd want or not want a certain job over others. Whatever job they focus on has to be fulfilling, bring a sense of security, tap into their creativity, offer opportunities for advancement or bring about positive changes in the lives of others. So why are so many who are out of work focused on the why of what they'd like to do moving forward, and yet many with jobs don't think a lot about the why of what they do once they've been in a job for a period? 
 I don't know where you are on the age timeline, but it doesn't matter as much as you think it might when it comes to figuring out what you want to do in one key respect. When you are considering various career or job options, if you don't fully know what a job entails, what the pros and cons experienced by the people who hold them at the moment are, or why the people working in those jobs love the work they do, there's one simple thing you can and should do; ask them. Simple really. 
 "So, Ahmed, why IT?" 
 "You obviously enjoy your job Dave, why is that?" 
 "Nancy, why did you first think this career would be right for you?" 
 You see it's not that hard to pose the question and you can come at it from a view different angles. Bottom line, you're still asking, "why?" You can go on of course to ask the other questions;  How  did you get started?/"  How  should I get started?" "  Who  helped you in the beginning?" "  What  are the qualities generally found in the people who succeed in this position?" "  Where  are the opportunities for tackling current issues?" "  When  would you suggest I apply?" 
 Now I suppose you might feel that you're being invasive; you know, asking something of someone you don't know at all or very well, why they do what they do. Is that the truth or is that actually a tactic of your own for avoiding asking because of your own comfort level? I tell you this, a lot of people would love to pause and remind themselves why they do what they do. Further, if they feel positively about the work they do and the impact they have, they would truly love to share that with someone (insert your name here!) who is genuinely interested. 
 As you'd be well aware, a great number of people change jobs and switch careers entirely over their lifetime. Want proof? Connect with a large number of people on LinkedIn and you'll get daily notifications inviting you to congratulate your connections who have started new positions. I get 2 or 3 a day - no exaggeration. People move and the question I wonder every time starts with why. "Why the move?" Why now?" 
 Of course sometimes the why turns out to be getting away from something that's turned sour, but the majority of the time it's for something the person perceives as a better fit. Again the question is why though? Better pay, a change of scenery, a fresh start, the infusion of energy brought about by a greater mental challenge? Why? 
 There are so many, 'why's?' in this piece, I'm reminded of young children who keep asking why this and why that, almost exasperating the adults around them with the never-ending series of why's that follow every answer. We can learn from them though because this is how young children make sense of things they are curious about and want to understand. Likewise, you and I might be just as curious to know why someone chose a career, why they've stayed for however long they have, why they might be thinking of a move, or why they made the change. It's how we can gather necessary information needed to make better informed decisions about our own career paths. 
 You objection is likely that you don't want to be viewed as the young child pestering people with questions to the point of exasperation. So don't pester. You should still ask politely and learn what you can about career choices, why people do what they do and why they find fulfillment in the jobs they hold. 
 The next piece in these lines of inquiry is to take that information learned and look at yourself. Why would this job, this company, etc., be right or perhaps not for you? 
 If you haven't thought about why you do what you do for a while, why is that?

 Where Do You See Yourself In 5 Years? 
 Career advice ,  Employment Counselling ,  interviewing ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  older workers 
 When I'm facilitating workshops on improving one's performance in job interviews, I often begin by asking those participating to share with me any questions they find difficult to answer. Among the questions which often come up is, 'Where do you see yourself in 5 years?' 
 In coming up with your answer for this question; and every other question you will be asked by the way, do your best to understand the purpose of the question. While you are doing your best to impress the interviewers and get a job offer, from their side of the table, they are looking for reasons to rule candidates out and hire the last person remaining. In other words, answering this question well can leave you in the hunt, answering it poorly can leave you out of the running. 
 So, what's behind the question? They might be checking to see if you've got ambition and see yourself having been promoted within the organization. While this strikes most people as surely a positive thing, it could trigger an area to be concerned about in the mind of the interviewer. Why? If they see you've already got your eyes on a more senior role in the organization, they could be going through this same hiring process in a short time; something they don't want to do. Hiring and training people takes time and money, and in return for that investment in hiring new people, they want and expect to get a return on that investment. When it's all about you and your career advancement, that doesn't show an understanding and empathy for the employer's situation. 
 Now on the other hand, some employer's hope and expect you'll outgrow an entry-level position, and if you stay with the company, they'd like you to advance having spent some time on the front-line. This way you've got an appreciation and first-hand experience of what it's like to work at the bottom and this can shape your work as you move up. If you show no ambition beyond the job after 5 years, they may look at you as stagnating and dead weight. 
 I have found a combination of the two above positions to be ideal for most people in most job interviews. Doing research into an organization and the people who work in the role you're after should reveal some insights that will aid you with the question. If however, you fail to unearth any clues about how long people typically stay in the job you're after, you still need an answer. See what you think of this: 
 
 Let me assure you my focus at this time is securing this position and investing myself in the job; ensuring you in turn get a return on your investment in hiring me. That being said, I'd like to take part in any courses, cross-training or collaborative projects which will put me in a position to compete successfully for opportunities which may present themselves in the future. 
 
 You see a lot can happen in 5 years. While you and the interviewer might both have ideas of how things will look in that time, you both are looking at the future armed only with what you know in the present with respect to the future. As time evolves, opportunities may present themselves for an organization to launch new products, expand or contract, re-brand themselves entirely, move or perhaps stay largely exactly as they are. All kinds of factors may impact your personal direction and ambition. 
 Now there are some answers which effectively take you right out of the running in the mind of some interviewers. Suppose you shared that you and your partner plan on starting your family and having a couple of children over the next 5 years. Doing the math, this could mean you're off for 2 of those 5 years on maternity leave, and your attendance and performance may become concerning both during pregnancy and once the children are born. Yes you've a right to start a family, but the interviewer knows there'll still be work needing doing, and if they have to hire short-term help to cover your position, well, if they can avoid it, they just might choose someone who doesn't raise this issue. Best to keep these plans to yourself. 
 Another possible problem answer is at the other end of the age spectrum. If see yourself as fully retired in 2-3 years, you could take yourself out of the running if they are wanting to hire someone they can make a long-term investment in. You might be perfect however if they are looking to hire someone for only 2-3 years while they restructure their workforce to compete better down the road. Getting what they can out of you for those few years might be pretty appealing and you part ways happily. Just don't make this answer all about you. Sure you'll get your pay for a few years and ride off into the sunset, but organizations aren't entirely charitable. What's in it for them? Productivity and someone who is totally invested in this single job and not looking beyond it to advance. 
 Some jobs have a high turnover precisely because they are entry-level, minimum wage jobs and employers expect if you have any ambition you'll move on. Not everybody wants to climb the ladder though and that's not a bad thing. Being consistently productive in a job is a wonderful quality; a win-win.

 Finding The Right Fit 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  mental health ,  philosophy ,  relationship building 
 I meet a great many people who are dissatisfied with the jobs they have. I also listen to an equal number of people who are unemployed completely and stuck deciding what it is they really want to do. That great job or career that everyone else seems to have, continues to elude them. 
 When I do talk to people who are by their own definition successful and happy, I've generally noticed that they've found an occupation that combines three key elements; it pays them well, they're good at what they do and yes, they like what they do. 
 I'll bet you can easily bring to mind people you know - perhaps even yourself - who are good at what they do, enjoy the work but aren't paid sufficiently well in their opinion. Such people tend to look at other organizations where they might do similar work but be compensated better. Money may not be everything, but money does give the means to live life on one's own terms and without enough of it, there can be a gap between how one lives and how one wishes to. 
 Then there are people who are paid well and are good at what they do, but they hunger for work that is more challenging, more rewarding. The work has either never really satisfied them or they've come to want to do something more meaningful and rewarding. These people will often surprise those they know by quitting good paying jobs to pursue other interests, leaving co-workers shaking their heads and wondering. 
 Finally, there are those who are paid well, like what they do but they aren't good at it. A lot of the time they don't last long in the job before being let go, but if they are in positions of influence and seniority, they can last a surprisingly long time in an organization; perhaps even resulting in the organization shutting down in the extreme over mismanagement and bad decision-making. 
 When all three factors align; being paid well, enjoying the work and being good at what one does, it would seem the fit is right and it's this we call success. 
 Now while a lot of people I've shared this idea with like the simplicity of the above, I find it interesting of note that most immediately pose some variation of the same problem time and time again. "I'm still left needing help to figure out what it is I should do job-wise." 
 The two are related of course, but they are different; finding the right fit and finding the right job or career. Let me explain. As an Employment Counsellor, I like the work I do, I feel I'm paid well and I can say I'm good at what I do. Were I to pick up and move to another organization but in a similar role as an Employment Counsellor, I might get paid less, or find that the scope of my job changed significantly. Hence I might have the right job but the other factors changed; in this case compensation for my work or the real work I'd be doing. 
 This could be where a lot of people go wrong; both job seekers and those who help people find employment. We broadly state the functions and responsibilities of a job - saying a Nurse does this or that, a Carpenter does this kind of work, a Labourer on an assembly line performs this or that, but really the experience of any one of these people will be different from others in the same roles but in different organizations. 
 The Carpenter might find a great fit in a small, rural community doing precision craftwork, where his talents are highly sought out and another might be happier doing restoration work in large cities working on a team of restoration carpenters. The job title might be the same, but the work done might need very different skill requirements and the environment the work is done in might mean the difference between liking the job or not. This is a factor only the person can decide. 
 I have for years felt the best place to start a job search is in fact not to look around at jobs on a job board, but to look inside one's self. What makes you tick? That simple question requires a lot of thought and self-awareness. In other words, get to know yourself; your likes and dislikes, preferences for working alone or in groups and under what circumstances for each. Determine the work environment, the kind of supervision you need and want. Skills you can generally acquire and work to improve if you choose. Learning about yourself first isn't a waste of time or stalling your career development. It's putting yourself in a place to ultimately succeed as you've never succeeded in the past in finding the right fit. 
 The good news is that you can find the right fit by design or chance. The bad news is you can go through a lot of jobs and yes even careers attempting to find what's the right fit for you if you don't pay attention to learning about yourself first. 
 Maybe it's because we think we know ourselves well that we overlook the obvious; but it's been my experience we don't know ourselves as well as we assume. And over time, yes, we change and so do our preferences. 
 May you find the right fit for you.

 'Why' Not 'What' The Key To What To Be? 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  mental health ,  philosophy 
 There are all kinds of jobs in this world from the mundane to the adventurous, from the physically straining to the mentally stimulating. Some require stamina to do the same task day after day and some require imagination and innovation to create new possibilities through trial and error. The tools to perform jobs can range from swinging handheld items to operating massive machinery; from a simple pencil to a robotic arm. There are a myriad of jobs out there, be they in cities of stone and glass, forests of green or pastures of gold. 
 And for every job, there are people best suited to do them. Some of us are physically strong, others the thinkers, the visionaries, recorders of history, we've leaders and followers, labourers and intellectuals. When it comes to work, we as a species engage in all kinds of activities, in all kinds of working conditions, be it water, on or under the land, the air or even space. 
 Often what we do for work is largely determined or influenced by where in the world we are born and then raised, the status of our family, the inclination of those who care for and influence us to expose us to a few or many different kinds of experiences. When we are born, where we are born, to whom we are born; all factor in to the opportunities we have. 
 There are those of course who will tout that you can be anything you put your mind to, and they may be right - if of course you are born into a society where you have the freedom to choose and the opportunities are there to seize. This freedom to be anything, aspire to be everything we want - limited only by our imagination and our own determination is empowering! Yet, this seemingly limitless potential can also have an unexpected and adverse affect. 
 With so many choices of what we might do with the time we have, it can be debilitating and paralyzing. After all, what if we get it wrong? What if we choose one career and work towards it only to discover that it doesn't bring us the fulfillment that we'd hoped. While it makes others happy we know, it doesn't bring us the satisfaction they promised it would. We believed them when they said we'd find it gratifying and rewarding, but it hasn't turned out that way. At least we tried it! Or what if we simply arrived at a crossroads having to choose between 2, 3 or 4 possible careers that seemed mutually exclusive - very different indeed - and being unable to commit to one 'dream' occupation for fear of turning our back on the others, we've simply found ourselves immobilized - and in a flash, years have rolled by and we're still standing still undecided? 
 There's this immense fear we'll get it wrong. Of course, some would say, "Ah, but what if we get it right?!" We might be amazing in what we do and more importantly even if we're just an average worker in what we've chosen, we could still be extremely happy and satisfied. But would we possibly wonder, "What if I'd chosen that other path in life? What might I have done?" 
 Of course we aren't limited to one career. Think on that… Up until we're in our late teens, we don't have to be anything largely but a student - well, again - depending on where we are born in the world. In our early 20's we begin to 'be' something. We who are older know this isn't a life-long obligation; we'll change jobs and careers during our life and some of these new choices will be in the same field and at times into a new one. After maybe 40 years of work, we might plan on ceasing to 'work' for pay and then work for play. Well, that's some people's plan. 
 Talk with enough people and you'll find competent, skilled people performing their jobs without the least bit of enthusiasm for the job. Good enough to keep doing what they do, benefitting the companies and the people they work on behalf of, but no longer stimulated and in love with the job. They've become comfortable, their income and lives stable, and so they live out their lives. 
 There are those too who take chances; who quit jobs for fear they'll become stale in them, who seek fresh challenges, new opportunities, gamble on trends and being out front as frontiers. They need not explore new lands, but they reinvent themselves, never-ceasing to learn and place themselves in the process to seize upon possibilities. 
 We're all so different, so uniquely, 'us'. What one finds pleasurable, rewarding, stimulating and satisfying might do for another or not. The key is perhaps to find out not what job we want to do, but why it is we want to do it. Toddlers may have it right when they ask incessantly, "Why?" 
 When we discover the, 'why' in why we want to do something, we are closer to discovering the 'what'. How peculiar it might be if instead of, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" which locks us into a single profession, we asked, "What motivates you? What inspires or stimulates you?" These are the what's that get to the why's. Then we might discover there are many jobs that would equally stimulate us by fulfilling our 'why's'. That perhaps, is very wise indeed.

 Re-Inventing Yourself? 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  mental health ,  older workers ,  philosophy ,  relationship building 
 Whether by choice or necessity, have you ever, or are you now in a place where you're re-inventing yourself? You know, moving in a completely new direction from what you've typically done work-wise in the past. Depending on your circumstances, this can be an exhilarating time of hope, possibilities and uncharted exploration, or it can be fraught with stress, desperation, anxiety and worry. 
 So, is it starting to sound like I'm speaking to you directly? There's actually a good chance that this resonates with you to some degree because all of us have times in our lives where we assume new roles. This is important to both hear and comprehend; all of us go through this. 
 It's true you know… becoming a teenager then an adult, being a parent or grandparent, the first job where we joined the ranks of the employed, leaving one job for another. There are all kinds of moments in our lives when we transitioned from one role to another. But somehow, changing your career at this particular time in your life seems markedly different from all those other transitions. This is magnified when you feel forced to make the change instead of initiating change out of a personal desire. 
 For a lot of folks, the anxiety is stirred up wondering what to actually do. It's like that year in high school where you had to make a decision on what you wanted to be when you grew up. As awkward as that period might have felt way back then, it pales in comparison to the present where you're no longer 17 or 18 years old with your entire work life in front of you. No, now you're looking at yourself and wondering, "what am I going to do at my age?" 
 For the men and women who have been in positions of labour their whole lives, this idea of needing a new vocation could be brought about because their bodies are no longer able to take the physical demands of their trade. While the body is refusing to do what it's always done, the brain is fully capable and stress is caused because the work they've done is only what they know. It's like laying bricks for 37 years and then the back and knees give out, so the Bricklayer struggles trying to figure out what else they could do. 
 Sometimes the body isn't the problem though. Sometimes the prevailing problem is of a mental rather than physical issue; the need to change careers is however just as valid. For many, there is still the notion - completely wrong in my opinion - that a mental health issue needs to be concealed, while a physical issue can be more easily shared and understood. So the person with two bad knees and a back issue gets empathy and understanding while the person with anxiety and depression draws more skepticism and doubt. As a result, some people hide their mental health challenges as long as they can, thereby making it difficult if not impossible to get the very support and help they need to move forward. 
 A good place to start when you have to re-invent yourself is taking stock of what you have on hand. Imagine yourself on a ship with your destination fully known and suddenly waking up one day to find yourself shipwrecked on an island. You need to survive so you take stock of what resources you have. You don't go off exploring your surroundings without first taking your bearings and assessing your needs and your resources. 
 Using that analogy, you've gone through - or are going through - the shock of an abrupt change in your work life. The future is going to be very different from your past and while you understand this on an intellectual level, you're at that crossroads trying to figure out in what direction to move. You're worried perhaps that with the limited time and resources you have available, you can't afford to just move in any old direction in case you choose wrong. If only you could look ahead and see the rewards and pitfalls in all directions and then decide. Life doesn't always work this way though; as you more than anyone has just found out because you didn't foresee where you are now in your future just a few years ago. 
 So take stock of your skills, experiences both paid and volunteer. What did you like and dislike about the work you've done in the past. What are you physically capable of and mentally able to take on? It may be that the very best thing you can do is give yourself the gift of a short break. Yes money might be tight but if you can free up funds for a short trip to somewhere you feel good in, you may do wonders for your mental health. 
 Getting a booklet on courses from a community college or university might enlighten you to jobs you haven't considered; and you might discover funding assistance at the same time to go back to school if you wish. 
 This crossroads you're in could be a blessing too. You've got time now to really think about what to do with your life; something some people who dislike their current jobs would envy you for. When you're ready, and definitely not before, reach out and share your thoughts with someone you who'll listen with an open mind. 
 All the very best as always!

 Looking For Work? 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  interviewing ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  mental health ,  older workers ,  philosophy ,  relationship building 
 Looking for a job or the next step in your career can be a stressful experience. While you may want a new position, you're not at all looking forward to the résumé writing, online applications, rejections, flat-out being ignored altogether when you apply for a job you really want and then of course the interview process. The rejection and ups and downs of the job search thing is frustrating, nerve-wracking and for what? A low-paying job doing something you'll dread, working for people who don't care about you but only how much they can wring out of you before you quit or your fired? 
 It doesn't have to be this way, nor should it. If this has been or is your experience, no wonder your desire to look for a new job is pretty weak. Let's look at some ideas to keep motivated during this search. 
 First of all it's a good idea - even if it seems completely obvious - to know why you want a new job. Are you burnt out in your current job, looking to put your recent education to use, looking for a part-time job to supplement your income or perhaps looking for a promotion? Knowing clearly why you want a new job is critical because in the moments when you feel frustrated and just want to chuck it in, you'll want to remind yourself why you started looking in the first place. 
 A successful job search is planned out just like any meaningful project. Whether it's building a house, running an ad campaign, raising funds for a charity or designing marketing materials, planning is critical. Too many people unfortunately start their job search randomly looking at employment websites. That shouldn't be your first step. 
 After you've determined why you want a new job, assess what you're starting with. Anyone starting a journey takes stock of their supplies and identifies both what they've got and what they'll need to acquire. In the case of a job search, what are your assets? Examine your education, past and current experience including paid and volunteer work. Objectively take stock of your job-specific and transferable skills, your financial resources and the extent you're willing to travel to work. 
 Now to decide what kind of work to actually pursue. Looking at that list of your assets, what jobs are you qualified for now? Do any of these jobs appeal to you? If so, great! If not, are you willing to invest time and money upgrading your education to acquire the academic qualifications you'll need to compete for the kind of jobs you might really want? This could involve some research with local College or University Guidance Counsellors to help you out. 
 By the way, if you feel you've got time and youth on your side, don't fret about finding the perfect job that checks off all your wants and desires. If you're light on experience, there's a lot of sense in doing a variety of jobs to help decide what brings you happiness; what you like and don't like. A variety of jobs gives you perspective, might even appeal to an employer if you place yourself later as having broad first-hand experience. So if you can't settle on THE job, relax and give yourself the green light to explore several jobs for say, the next 5 years. 
 Now what's important to you? Are you after job satisfaction, money, a certain kind of environment to work in or a job that involves travel? What do you imagine is the kind of boss you'll work best with? There are many factors that you should look at to find what's important to you and if you need help doing this, get yourself connected with a local Employment Coach, Employment Counsellor or Career Specialist. These are the people who can best help you look at the factors that will ultimately bring you happiness in the work you do. 
 So with some job or career loosely or firmly in mind, turn to looking at the organizations that have these kind of positions. Taking the time to see how they differ from each other, what they rank and value, the atmosphere they create for those that work there is time well spent. You don't want to find you love the job but loathe working in the atmosphere that surrounds it. 
 At this point you've got a career or job goal in mind that you're skills and experience align with, and you've identified one or more companies that you'd like to be a part of. Now is the time to look at applying. Just because there are no current postings doesn't mean there are no opportunities. Networking and initiating conversations with those who do what you want to do, work where you want to work and hire people like you is essential and often overlooked. Get known. 
 Once you're connected, keep focused. Sure go ahead and ask about opportunities but do seek advice on what you could be doing in the here and now to strengthen your chances when a position is advertised. Positioning yourself to succeed shows them your keen and gives you momentum when otherwise you'd feel stalled. 
 Whether your 25, 45 or 60, take stock of what you've got, what you want and why you want it. 
 The steps above will take some time to transition through; varying for each person. Skip a step as unnecessary and you might be looking for some time.

 Opportunities Squandered Or Seized? 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  mental health ,  older workers ,  philosophy 
 Look even casually at anyone you truly admire for having met with success and you'll undoubtedly find a person who given an opportunity, made a conscious decision to seize it. 
 There are the athletes who train hard outside the limelight and put in hours when it's just themselves and their strength and conditioning programs. There are the explorers who took risks heading off into the then unknown with hopes of what they might find to fuel their dreams. There are the students in school who place themselves in the hands of others to learn, become educated and lay the groundwork for their individual futures. What binds them all together is the choice they made to place themselves in positions to succeed. 
 Not everyone however recognizes the opportunities before them or makes the decisions you and I might assume they would to better themselves. We can look around and easily find students in Universities and Colleges who have a lack of investment in the learning before them. We can readily find athletes with potential who become complacent; who settle for mediocre, would rather party than continue to commit to the regime of training and self-discipline that had them formerly on the rise. 
 From the outside, it's often clear when we look at others who is committed and who is not; who is seizing opportunity with both hands and who is squandering that which may or may not come again. 
 What is harder and less appealing is to look at ourselves. We don't always recognize real opportunities when they lay before us, and even when we do, isn't it the case that we often squander them? The reasons? Perhaps a lack of money, courage, self-motivation, reluctance to put in the hard work required, competing commitments etc. For those that squander chances and opportunities, there's always a reason. 
 I work with people in receipt of social assistance, most of whom are unemployed and some of whom are underemployed in part-time jobs both in and outside their fields of training, education and interest. You might assume that every one of these people would be looking to improve their financial situation; looking to get back to being gainfully employed and productively contributing to the society in which they live as a result. You'd be wrong. Just like in any other group of people, you'll find the highly motivated and the ones letting opportunities pass them by. 
 Over the last couple of weeks I've had the distinct privilege to work closely with 10 unemployed people who are looking for employment. Each of the 10 had the same introduction to the two weeks given to them individually. They heard that one of my key expectations was that they must want a job more than I want it for them to be successful. They were even advised that if they didn't want to put in the work required, I'd rather they didn't choose to join in, and no penalty would befall them for turning the opportunity down. Now of these 10, there wasn't one who didn't agree. 
 Things being what they are however; and yes you've probably guessed it, not all 10 seized this opportunity with the same enthusiasm. At the end of the first week I asked everyone in the group to share how many jobs they'd applied to, how many calls they'd made and how many interviews they'd had. While each person reported at least some achievement, one person reported no calls made, no jobs applied to and not surprisingly no interviews forthcoming. Puzzling. 
 This isn't the place to share all the background I explored and learned for reasons of confidentiality however, I can say with conviction that this is an opportunity squandered. Sure there's personal factors; there always are. Not one of the 10 in the group doesn't have barriers to overcome and in this they are just normal people like you and I. Everybody has challenges; things that we either face, struggle with and commit to overcoming or things we choose to give power over us. 
 Now what of you? What's your personal situation at the moment? I'm willing to say that you've got something now before you that is an opportunity hanging in the balance. It might be an employment program, a return to school, a job that would need a move on your part, an apprenticeship, a course to upgrade a licence or certificate. You might have put off this opportunity for a long time too, and with the passage of time you're feeling that chance is now becoming more remote than ever. But it still keeps nagging at you. 
 Is it your age, wondering how you'd pay to go back to school and still pay the mortgage and provide for the family? Is it not wanting to have wasted the education you have already which at one time you thought would set you on your career path? Maybe it's that your afraid of the pressure it takes to throw yourself back into a determined job search; pressure being something that has in the past triggered your dependency on drugs to cope with; a path you don't want to revisit. 
 The good thing about opportunities is that they come to us all the time. You've got several before you today in fact. Today - yes today - could be the very day you make a decision to seize one.

 Thinking Of Returning To School? 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  interviewing ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  mental health ,  older workers 
 If you are one of the many people who are finding that landing a job is difficult at present, one of the things you might be thinking of is returning to school to further your education. This could be just the remedy you need or a colossal waste of your time and money, resulting in kick-starting your career or leaving you saddled with debt and still with no job. Yikes! Isn't that your biggest fear!? 
 Debt; four simple letters which together could find you with a poor credit rating, affecting your future ability to buy a car, a house, even land a job with some organizations. Just the thought of going to school and investing a year or more of your precious time only to have the possibility you could emerge still in the same situation with no job prospects? Why it's enough to drive a person crazy! 
 Hang on a minute. Let's look at this rationally and objectively. Take a breath; a deep one that fills your lungs and then exhale. Do it again. Better? Okay, let's begin. Oh and I should add that I have no vested interests in any educational institution. 
 Supposing that as our premise, you are finding it difficult to get job interviews and when you do, you're not getting job offers. It could be that there are too many people with the same qualifications as you, and in addition, some of your competition have added education. The decision to head on back to school and may be exactly the right decision if employers in your field place a high value on extra education, or you learn they view your education as out-of-date. 
 Could be that your degree from 1981 is now of questionable value, or in a field like technology where advances come often and quickly, you're losing out to new grads. If you have been able to narrow down what course or training you're lacking that is holding you back, then returning to the classroom to get it is wisdom my friend. Don't even read the rest of this article; get up and go register now! 
 Another solid reason for more education is if you have come to a point in your life where a completely different career is in order. You've grown and with aging you've found you have new interests; interests which you'd like to pursue as a career and your current education doesn't qualify you to compete. Same advice, quit reading and contact the College or University and get yourself registered. 
 There is another kind of situation you might be in which could also have you considering the classroom as an option. You might not be at all sure what kind of work you'd like to do. Returning to school would cocoon you from the world of work for 2-3 years while you pursued a degree or diploma. Couldn't hurt at any rate to add some letters to the end of your name, and hopefully you'd figure it out in that time. 
 Well it's not up to me to say one way or the other but generally I'd say all education is worthwhile. It will add to your resume and maybe some time in a placement applying those skills could indeed spark a real interest you then pursue and life all works out beautifully. That money you owe when you graduate isn't debt at all but rather an investment you've made in your mind and your future. Well done! 
 However, that time you spend in a classroom could actually prove harmful. If you graduate and then don't feel inspired to look for work doing what you went back to school to learn, that money you spent might actually just be plain old debt; with you no closer to knowing what to do with your working life. 
 A good idea perhaps is before investing your time and money in school, interview some people doing the work you might be doing upon graduation. Pick their brain, find out what they really do and ask yourself if you'd be happy in a similar position? Ask the employers you'd be asking to hire you when you graduate if they prefer graduates from certain schools or programs. Not much point happily going to school somewhere only to graduate and then find employers don't value what you received or the institution you got it from isn't recognized. 
 One thing is for sure; don't return to school just to hide from work. If you're not sure what to do, spend some time working in several jobs. Invest a year - maybe two or three actually - doing a number of jobs finding out what you like and what you don't. You choose what goes on a future resume anyhow, so don't fret about job hopping; you're on a mission of discovery. 
 Going back to school is a wise decision which will improve the way you think, make you more competitively employable and give you an edge. However, upgrading your education and then finding out you're eventually working in a job you could have got three years ago without your new degree might be a waste of time or just part of your education in the game of Life. Depends on your attitude and how you view things. 
 Best advice if you're on the fence? Make a decision either way, and make it NOW; the stress of not deciding isn't helpful. You're on the clock.

 How Many Jobs Should You Apply To Per Day? 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  interviewing ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  older workers ,  philosophy 
 The short answer is a nice big fuzzy, "it depends." 
 Now of course the logical question you're framing in your mind is what does it depend on? Am I correct? While setting goals for yourself is commendable and strongly encouraged, it's not always the best strategy to set a number of jobs to apply to each day when you're out of work. That may come as a surprise to some of my readers given that I'm an Employment Counsellor. 
 An effective job search is about more than just filling out applications and firing off resumes to organizations online or via email. In fact, a healthy job search allocates time to a number of activities which will keep you busy and productive. 
 Now while you may be driven to actually apply for employment, it's not always the case that the person who applies for the most number of jobs is ultimately the first one hired. Nor is it the case that the one who applies for the most number of jobs is the one who lands in the right job; and that can lead to many job changes when the positions don't last long. 
 Sure you should look for jobs daily. By all means set aside some time in the morning to see what new postings may have come out in the last 24 hours. You don't want to miss an opportunity that you've otherwise kept your eye on and find it has some extremely short deadline to apply and then miss it. How unfortunate that would be! If you also look into postings once during the afternoon, you're already doing a good job of staying on top of what's available. 
 There are other things you should be paying attention to however; and it's these other things that will keep you productively engaged in your job search and give you enough variety so you avoid discouragement. Here's a list: 
 
 References.  Now is the best time to put together a list of the people you know who will vouch for your work performance. Current or former employers, supervisors and/or co-workers are excellent choices. You'll need a minimum of 3 of these, including the correct spelling of their names, titles, company names, phone numbers and emails. By the way, send them a current resume to have on hand as well as a note of appreciation for their ongoing support. 
 Social Media Profile.  When applying for a position, many employers will turn to the internet and dig around to find what they can about you. If you started a LinkedIn profile but never really developed it much, now is a great time to devote some attention to developing and fleshing out your profile. Put in a little effort now and you won't feel embarrassed about your profile later. 
 Exercise.  Job searching is stressful for almost everybody and it manifests itself in physical ways. Getting out for a walk, bicycle ride, the elliptical gathering cobwebs in the basement or a trip to the gym will not only improve your physical fitness but ward off aches and pains. 
 Enjoy A Pastime.  If you need permission to spend some time doing things you enjoy, here it is. Get out in the garden, work those knitting needles, pound those keyboards, pick up that paintbrush. Setting aside some time to do things which bring you happiness and keep up your sense of normal day-to-day living is strongly encouraged. Job searching need not be all-consuming. 
 Practice Interviewing.  I know, I know, I know. This is likely something you don't enjoy and only want to do when absolutely necessary. Still, without practice and more practice, you're not going to be at your best just winging it on the day of the big interview. You'll feel mounting anxiety if you put off practicing and end up sitting in some Reception area wishing you had dusted off your interview skills earlier. 
 Work Your Network.  Networking is essential; engaging with other people, taping into their resources, gaining support and advice, drawing on their expertise and experience. Be it phone calls, face-to-face, over the net, etc., devote some time to reaching out. All those friends on FB and connections on LI you've been building are a good place to start. 
 Diet.  By diet I do not mean lose weight. What I do mean is pay attention to both the quantity of food you consume and the quality. When you're off work, the proximity to your pantry and fridge is considerably reduced, and your trips to both may be much more frequent. If you don't bring junk into the house in the first place it won't be there for you to over-indulge in during those weak moments when you crave comfort food. 
 
 There's more you could be doing for sure, but these 7 are a good start. Setting yourself an arbitrary goal of say, 8 job applications a day will either set you up to fail or have you applying at jobs you don't really want at all just to meet this quota. 
 If you're only applying to a single job every week or less you've got to step things up my friend. What I'm saying is balance is the key; apply for jobs that you're truly qualified to do and motivated to do - absolutely. It's equally important however to get out from in front of a monitor and keep living.

 Ask The Right Questions Or Don't 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  philosophy 
 I am privileged as an Employment Counsellor to engage in meaningful conversations with people looking for employment. If you listened in on these, you'd hear me pose a number of questions and with each answer a clearer picture of the person would be revealed. 
 The trap someone in my place can easily fall into is to size up the job seeker in a few moments based on all the previous job seekers one's worked with and miss what makes this person unique. The questions I ask and especially the ones I might not, can and do make all the difference in helping that one person find the right match; what they're really after. 
 For example ask the question, "So what job are you looking for?", and I'm likely to get a simple job title. "Personal Support Worker". This reply is correct, definitive and tells me nothing of the person themselves. If I worked in an environment where success was based solely on churning out resumes and getting people to apply for jobs measured my performance, this would be the fastest way to carry out that goal. However, that seems backwards measuring my success rather than the job seekers based on quantity and not quality. 
 There's better questions to ask of someone looking for work; questions which are far more effective at assisting someone to find and keep employment. Better questions that get at the person themselves and their motivation for work. 
 When I ask, "So what do you want out of your next job?", one will glibly state, "A pay cheque." Another will say, "I want to find meaning in what I do", or, "I want a job where I can make a difference; where I can really help others." So of the two answers, which person would you rather have caring for you as a Personal Support Worker? I'll opt for the person who is motivated by their wish to make a difference in the lives they'll touch over the person working for a pay cheque. 
 Another good question I like to pose is, "Tell me about that job; what would you actually do?" I ask this question whether I have a really solid understanding of the daily functions of the role or not. This question is really designed to give me information on what the job entails from their perspective and how well that matches up with what employer's set out as the responsibilities and job functions. Working in a Veterinary Clinic for example sounds appealing to those who like animals but many aren't ready to keep their opinions and values to themselves when an owner comes to an agonizing decision to put down their beloved pet. It's not all cuddling and grooming. 
 As I listen to someone describe the job they are after, I also focus my attention on not only the actual words they use but whether there is any passion or genuine love for the work described. This is most often revealed through a smile on the face, a softening of the eyes, a change in the pace of their words and some varying of the tone in their voice. Do they show and demonstrate some enthusiasm and excitement at the prospect of doing this job or not? Some speak very matter-of-factly about their work of course and for many that's exactly what it is; work. 
 Perhaps you've heard that expression, "Find a job you love and you'll never work a day in your life"? Well, even the most ardent worker who loves their job with all they've got will tell you they still make a significant investment in their time working to improve their productivity, working to keep their high standard of performance or working to keep up with best practices. Stop working at being your best and you rot. So if we all 'work' at work, why isn't the experience of work the same for everyone? 
 Simply put, it's what we put in and what we get out of it; investment and return. The best athletes aren't just naturally gifted, they invest countless hours training, improving, working on elevating their performance to be the best they can be. The brightest often experiment and when they don't succeed they embrace that failure and learn from what didn't work to discover what will. So when I ask, "What are willing to put into the job?", if they answer with the question, "You mean overtime?" that tells me volumes. 
 Here's what I think about, "overtime". I find that a person I work with will often end up over time securing a job which differs from the one they originally identified to me because having got to know them better, together we've found a better fit. In other words, with some question and answers, they've discovered that finding satisfying and fulfilling work is more than just finding a job. 
 If you believe that in this economy this kind of thinking is a luxury and one can only hope for a job and a pay cheque, you are entitled to that opinion. There are professionals who will gladly take your money and your time while mass producing your resumes. 
 As an alternative, let's ask some probing questions; get to the heart of what makes you unique and find where you'll truly live that passion that seems so elusive. 
 I'd love to hear your own thoughts on this. Please comment and share.
