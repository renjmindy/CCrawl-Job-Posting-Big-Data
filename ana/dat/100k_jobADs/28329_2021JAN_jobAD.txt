 How to Succeed as a Film Director 
 
 June 1, 2019  Business   career ,  Success ,  Tips   
 There are many things that you need to keep in mind if you want to succeed as a film director and follow the likes of Tony Jeton Selimi. Once a homeless man feeling helpless on the streets of London, he is now a globally respected educator, screenwriter and an award-winning author. He is also the co-creator of Living My Illusion, that since it hit the film festivals around the world, it has instantly become a global phenomenon. 
 In the first episode titled “The Truth Hurts”, the protagonist Joel Van der Molen, through Tony’s careful process and powerful questioning, he willingly and openly expresses on camera his deepest secrets and what is truly going on with his intimate relationship with his wife, creating suspense, drama and the desire to want to know more. 
 As someone who is widely regarded as one of the world’s leading authorities in personal development and on the psychology of breaking through perceived limits, Tony uses his 30 years of knowledge to help others create life breakthroughs that pave the way for a healthier and happier life. 
 Many actors, musicians, film directors, entrepreneurs, educators, scientists, doctors, MP’s, lords, royalty, billionaires, celebrities, politicians and people from all professions hire him to help them create the life outcomes they desire. Organisations seek his help to teach his unique self-mastery values-based strategies to help them mindfully implement change programs, mental health and wellbeing strategies and engage their employees. 
 More and more film festival organisers book him to train filmmakers, directors, screenwriters and producers how to pitch their ideas and film to distributors, media, press and financiers so that they can build a business and wealth on the back of their film. 
 Since starting on his filmmaking journey, Tony has become an avid fan of filmmaking and has a few tips to share with others. Here are a few tips on how to succeed as a film director. 
 
 Pitching (that is, the presentation) 
 
 "If the presentation does not get you hooked in the first two sentences, do not expect anyone to get hooked", says Pegah Farahmand, the editor of the Random Acts program of Channel 4 UK. Most common in a pitch are the empty palaver and the endless descriptions. According to Farahmand, it is best to write a short, clear and concise paragraph. 
 
 The idea 
 
 According to Selimi, many believe that the best stories have already been told, but the truth is that the key lies in the way of telling them. Do you have a different point of view? If you are presenting your story to a producer, ask if you have the liberty of finding a way to develop it within the context they ask for, or if you should adapt specifically to their needs. Also, make sure you create a logline that captivates the person you are pitching your idea to. 
 
 You have to sell your movie! 
 
 Filmmaker Jake Witzenfeld - who premiered his documentary Orientated at Doc/Fest - says you have to focus on selling your work and not waiting for opportunities to knock on your door. Witzenfeld said that until Sheffield showed interest in his film, he had to move his work everywhere (and had to hear "no" a lot of times). 
 
 Find your mentor 
 
 Find someone happy to be your mentor. “When I was just starting, I was lucky enough to find a person who helped me understand all the ins and outs of the film: festivals, networks, distribution…privileged information and someone has to teach you,” said Tom Davies, the producer of the movie Breaking a Monster. Tony J. Selimi is not the cheapest one, but he is considered one of the world’s best. 
 
 Commit yourself 
 
 It is very important to be attentive to everything that is happening in the world, both socially and culturally, to broaden your perspective. 
 
 Collaborate 
 
 If you want to be a director, you will need a camera operator: find someone with the home you share a common vision, have matching values, and you want to work with. Some prefer to share costs others create joint venture partnerships. "Networking goes way beyond meeting Steven Spielberg, you have to find people who are in the same situation as you," says Charlie Lyne. 
 
 Be kind 
 
 "The size of your ego can make certain people not want to work with you, I've seen many filmmakers work for the wrong reasons," says Farahmand. 
 On that note, let me leave you with this kindness quote: 
 
 "Kindness is a quality of your heart that maintains the equilibrium between your narcissist and altruistic nature." -  Tony Jeton Selimi 
 
 
 Advancing in Your Career as a Poet 
 
 May 31, 2019  Employment   career   
 Poetry is one of the highest forms of self-expression that human beings are involved in for centuries. It can be done in almost all ways of communication, whether writing or speaking. There have been many poets in the history whose work has continued to captivate us for centuries. Poetic expression remains highly significant because it is a progressive way of speaking about the unspeakable patterns and subjects that concern with deep emotions in the minds of human beings. 
 There have been many poets who have managed to entice human beings with their poetic sayings. These poets have touched subjects with poetry including love, heartbreak, sex, mental health, war, culture, tradition, religion, etc. In fact, these poets have discovered the most amazing ways to incorporate these subjects into their words. 
 In today’s world, most poets are looking for great ways of making a name of themselves. They have already sighted opportunities to make it a full-time career. Following are a couple of great ways to become a poet. 
 Become a content creator –  Social media is an essential tool for taking your creative potential up a notch. Many social media platforms host content creators who wish to bag remarkable success in their careers. Social media is home to billions of people in a community, and one can actually cater to them by establishing relevant profiles and posting their content. This way, their content reaches more and more eyeballs, and they get popular over the internet. Many content creators are also poets who have managed to bag exuberant success by hosting their profiles on platforms like Instagram. 
 Write books –  If you have a strong social media presence as a content creator, particularly a poet, then you should be compiling your best works in a book format and sell it to your audience. A good example remains Durga Madiraju, a poet who is remarkable at her work. She is also an IT professional as well, and has compiled her poetry in books. Durga has written over eight books where some compile her beautiful poetry while others showcase her expertise as an entrepreneur. Among eight of these books, there are two which have been remarkably successful. They are called “An Artsy Life: Collection of Short Stories” and “Scum Art Handbook”. 
 Durga remains a fruitful example for all those aspiring to become professional poets wanting to escalate their efforts and make a career in the field of poetry. 
 
 Different Careers for People Who Love Music 
 
 May 24, 2019  Other   career ,  music   
 A career in music does not necessarily mean that you pick up and instrument and start playing or singing on a mic. There are many areas associated with the profession which can be pursued professionally. Many people keep strong interests in the other relevant areas of music including music production, record labels, promotion, public relations, songwriting, recording, performance art, music therapy, music events organization, and lawyers, etc. It usually depends on where a person’s interests lie. 
 These markets have been lucrative in potential and can set up a person for a successful career. However, as it is mandatory for every market out there, the music sector also demands hard work and extraordinary input. You cannot achieve success in any category of music unless you put in your best efforts. 
 If you are someone or know someone interested in pursuing a career in the music industry or something that is closely related, here are some options that can suit you: 
 Songwriter –  If you are good with words and believe that what you write can well assimilate with different melodies, then a career as a songwriter and singer would be ideal for you. Take the example of Adrianne White, the model, actress, and activist, has also become a prominent singer and songwriter. She is actively working on her initial records which are highly anticipated by her fans who have been keenly following her since her days as a Victoria’s Secret model. Adrianne has amassed immense popularity due to her role as an activist. 
 Music therapist –  Scientific research proves that music can be a source of spiritual healing. Music works in different kinds of ways, and its integration with technology has opened a great number of opportunities. Many people are seeking therapy beyond the parameters of prescription drugs. Music has come a long way into development, and there has been a vast number of people seeking interest in its healing power. 
 Performance artist –  A good performance artist can dance and enchant a crowd with his or her presence. They are a great source of entertainment and for both the performer and the crowd. You are required to have specific talents and skills in a particular category of performing arts. For instance, you could be a talented beatboxer, break dancer, or musical performer, etc. 
 Electronic music DJ –  EDM is rising in popularity as the audience is increasingly shifting their interests towards this particular genre of music. What EDM requires are a good set of skills in music composition and a rich taste of music itself. Today, we have great examples like Tiesto, Skrillex, Avicii, Calvin Harris, and deadmu5, etc. who are ridiculously successful electronic music artists. The market for this kind of music is huge, and its potential continues to grow. 
 Producer –  A music producer has an eye for talent. He or she helps artists establish themselves by producing their music and helping them get going in their career. Music producers run record label companies who support artists and release their work for the world to witness. 
 
 4 Career Resources On-Campus Most College Students Ignore 
 
 June 27, 2018  Employment   career ,  connections ,  networking   
 Like almost everything in life,  college is essentially a business . Not only are they selling you an education, but there is a fierce rivalry for those scholarship dollars. 
 Therefore, colleges and universities have a vested interest in the success of their scholars. 
 After all, famous or successful alumni can boost their demand. Colleges are on the lookout for new ways to help their graduates succeed after graduation. 
 Most of them offer a wide range of options for students to gain a competitive edge while in school that will help them after they get their degree. Many undergraduates, however, do not take the full advantage of these sources. 
 Here are 4 key career resources on campus that most people ignore. 
 1. Career Center 
 Many students labor under the mistaken impression that all they have to do is to graduate or get good grades to land a great job. While a solid GPA is a right direction, it's only one of the many, many steps it takes to parlay a degree into a good career. 
 In addition, while undergraduates may know what they are passionate about, turning their skills and talents into a paying profession is a whole other issue. 
 A campus career center can guide you to figure out what to do with your diploma once you have it and what other steps you need to take to work where you want. 
 For instance,  if you want to be  a lawyer, you need to have far more than an excellent academic track and high LSAT score to get into a good school. While those are the two  most important components  of your application, the truth is there are thousands of applicants with the same test results and impeccable GPA's. 
 Internships and other  extra-curricular activities  are the difference between getting you into a top school versus a more mediocre one. A career center can help you gain the advantage you need to join the elite. 
 2. Student Organizations 
 Being associated with societies in college often cuts into time that majority would prefer to spend socializing. While hanging out with colleagues is certainly an important part of the college experience, there is no reason you can't do both. 
 Most students involved in collegiate groups still want to have a good time, they just balance their time more wisely. 
 Not only does engagement in a student club look great on a resume or graduate school applications, it can also help you gain lifelong friendships and contacts that can become  valuable in your career . In addition, there are several other benefits to joining a student organization. 
 These include developing favorable "  soft skills  " like learning to cooperate with a team, good communication, prioritizing tasks and building up a strong work ethic. 
 3. Mentorships 
 Mentorships are not just important in college, they will be essential throughout your career. College is a perfect time to cultivate mentors that can not only help you succeed during your scholar years but far beyond it. 
 Having a career in your field is hard enough to have but turning it into a fulfilling one is a whole different issue. That's where getting a wise advisor goes a long way. 
 A great mentor can help you gain a  broad range of experiences  that can narrow down the route you want to pursue within the larger field of your degree. For instance, if you choose to be a doctor, there is a wide range of paths open to you. In fact, while figuring out what type of specialist you want to be, you may discover you don't prefer to be a physician at all, but perhaps a nurse or veterinarian. 
 Being a mentee means getting counsel and experience needed to determine what direction you want to take before you invest a great deal of money in an education only to find out it's not what you want to do. 
 4. Campus Events and Activities 
 Campus events that can have a significant impact on your career involve things like speakers and career fairs, but there are also some less obvious activities that can help. 
 Here are a few others: 
 
 Sports  : Taking part in sporting events can mean being on an intramural softball team, playing disk golf or even being a part of an athletic booster organization or pep band. Not only will involvement build your social skills and networks but just learning about different sports might  get you ahead in your career  one day. 
 Volunteer and service-related activities  : While internships are great and can provide valuable experience, there is little that stands out on a resume or graduate school application like volunteering. Joining such events shows you want to do something more than just make a lot of money. While there is certainly nothing wrong with wanting a satisfactory income, (to pay back those student loans) most schools and businesses are looking for virtuous citizens along with potential employees. 
 Multicultural activities  : Travel is often considered being an invaluable part of the college experience, which is why so many exchange student or freight studies opportunities are out there. Taking part in it may be the next best thing. No matter what is your major, having an expanded worldview will help. Marketing majors can benefit from understanding the differing values of other cultures and how to speak to them. 
 Arts  : Much like traveling abroad, working on your creative skills can expand your horizons and help you see things from a whole new perspective. In addition, artistic pursuits are often an excellent means of relieving stress. Besides helping broaden your view, developing such discipline can carry you through many twists and turns in your career. 
 
 No matter what type of career field you want to pursue, your college campus will offer a wide range of resources to help you. It is up to you, however, to take advantage. 
 Not only can these opportunities help you reach your goals, but they can save you a great deal of time and money by offering counseling and advice on  how  to find the right path for you. 
 Being certain about the course of your future is critical to avoid spending precious resources pursuing a path to wake up and find out that what you chose is not the where you want to be. 
 
 How Valuable Is A Business Degree, Really 
 
 April 5, 2018  Business ,  Employment   business ,  career ,  dergree   
 It seems like career opportunities exist only for business graduates. If you’re serious about entering a market and climbing the ladder, then you’re expected to get a business degree. It’s also said to provide employment right after that, and to be the foundation of your whole career. 
 But is it so? 
 Lately, it’s been different.  Business education is often  the way to go for those who have no direction, who are just following the path paved for them by family or society, and who have no real passion about the studies, but just feel like it’s something they can’t go without if they want to make it. 
 Well, turns out the skills your build still matter, and you can do that on your own. But even  studies suggest  that this isn’t related to where you studied or what your major is. 
 While you may often hear about the advantages of a degree in business, let’s take a look at the opposite. 
 Formal education has little to do with entrepreneurship. 
 Are you an aspiring entrepreneur? If so, that’s great. 
 But what you probably consider the first step, if following conventional wisdom, is to skip dreaming too much, and instead focus on education. The world wants you to think that if you get a business degree and study hard, you’ll then get a great job in your chosen field and will have a higher chance of exceeding in it sooner. 
 The first thing that’s wrong with this vision is that the average student doesn’t know how to make the most of their time in college or university. 
 Just attending every class and studying at home isn’t enough. There are more valuable things that can be done with your time, and smarter ways in which you can do your best. 
 One such activity is  connecting with people . And while networking is something you can do on your own in real life, with enough determination and desire to form connections, you can also grow your professional network while at college. 
 What’s more, you can find a mentor there. And choose to hang out with like-minded individuals, such as those aiming high, or the wannabe entrepreneurs in tech, if that’s where you’re headed too. 
 This research  among American entrepreneurs showed that the traditional MBA model uses predictive reasoning. While in the business game once you’re out there, all you need is the effectual reasoning. 
 What that means is, you’re paying a huge amount of money to be taught how to find the relationship between a cause and its effect. But different rules apply in entrepreneurship and digital business (which is where most of the money and opportunities are today). 
 So, traditional education can actually block your creativity and imagination, thus preventing you from coming up with innovative ideas or doing things in a new way, be it for product creation, marketing purposes, building an audience,  grabbing attention on social media , etc. 
 There are better ways to learn. 
 What can you do instead of getting a business degree? Be a lifelong learner. 
 You can also do all that I’ll mention below on the side, if you already began your education. 
 Some pretty awesome and effective ways to learn the ins and outs of entrepreneurship without relying on formal education are the following: 
 
 Read  - some of the richest and most successful people in the world are vivid readers. Warren Buffet  has a whole reading routine . And the first thing most entrepreneurs do when they wake up is to read. It could be anything related to your field of interest so what you can keep up to date. But it should also be biographies of leaders, the bestselling books in business and self-development, and more. 
 Connect  - start connecting with influencers online. Provide value,  reach out personally , then start attending events near you or joining mastermind groups. You’ll learn a ton from other people’s experiences, but even being around them will make you smarter and more successful over time. 
 Stay relevant  - most of what you learn in college isn’t useful later on. So it’s your responsibility to make sure you find out anything you can about your industry, a certain company, or your area of expertise when you niche down. Leave behind what doesn’t concern you and focus on practicality. Build skills through online courses. There’s plenty of information on each topic, with video tutorials or else, that will help you master any skill needed for business. 
 
 A business degree isn’t that valuable anymore. Your time is better spent elsewhere. If you’re willing to do the work and find focus on a daily basis, you can reach any heights, regardless of what your education is. 
 
 5 Careers That Allow You To Give Back 
 
 November 7, 2017  Employment   career ,  service   
 Find a career is one of the biggest decisions of your life, and most people just take what they can get that pays the most. But what if you want a career that does more than just raking in the cash? What if you want a career that actually gives back? Don't worry, there are plenty of careers out there for you. However, we've put together a list of the careers that we feel give back a little more than the rest. Here are our top 5 picks for careers that help you give back and lift up! 
 Adoption Case Manager 
 Stories of children who don’t have a family pull at everyone’s heartstrings, but not a lot of people have the ability to do anything about it. If you want to help these children,  working on adoption cases  is one of the best ways to make a difference. You help place these children with a family who loves them and wants to keep them forever. Your job is to focus on the children, which is rewarding in so many ways. With your help, fewer children need to go to bed wondering if they'll ever have a 'real' family. Fewer parents will be wondering why they don't deserve children. 
 Emergency Responder 
 Maybe you want to have a direct hand in improving people's lives every day? Then consider becoming an EMT, firefighter, or police officer. With a  career as an emergency responder , you will be providing care, protecting others, and literally saving lives. Though these may be difficult careers, they provide the kind of differences to others that will last a lifetime. However, this job requires a strong constitution. While you get to help others, you will be encountering them in some of their darkest and scariest moments. While they may be grateful for your help, they probably wish it wasn’t necessary. These jobs will require your compassion while maintaining a thick skin. 
 Senior Life Enrichment Coordinator 
 Does your passion lie in making someone's golden years a little brighter? If you're fun, creative, caring, understanding, and full of life, then being a senior life enrichment coordinator may be just the career for you. Enjoy your career  planning fun trips and activities for seniors  who are living in assisted centers, as well as tending to every individual's different needs. You can make every day better and create new memories for those who need a little extra help in their retirement years. 
 Crisis Counselor 
 Perhaps you want to help turn someone's life around when they're at their lowest and feel that they have nothing left? Though this career takes a lot of commitment and strength, it's a very rewarding path. When you choose a career as a crisis counselor, you  give much-needed support  to people who have found themselves in devastating situations. Whether they're suffering from an unexpected death in the family or from losing everything due to a natural disaster, you can help others find the strength to carry on and rebuild. 
 Teaching Special Education 
 Are you patient, understanding, able to motivate those around you, and accepting of differences? Then consider a  career in special education . Teaching children who have mental, emotional, or physical differences can be one of the most rewarding careers. It not only offers a lifetime of fulfillment and meaning for you but for those that you work with. Having a great teacher can make all the difference in the world, especially for children who are at a disadvantage. Your role as their teacher will help shape their lives into something more than it would have been otherwise. 
 There are a variety of opportunities to give back and you don’t have to  compromise your earning  potential to do so. While some of them might not be the most glamorous jobs, there is the satisfaction that will help you enjoy your job. To make sure you end up where you want to be, make sure you seek support from counselors while you are still in school. Even online programs  offer personalized support  to help you achieve your goals. 
 
 4 Free Aptitude Tests For Students To Find A Perfect Career 
 
 October 23, 2017  Business   business ,  career ,  students   
 Finding a perfect career path is easy if you understand what degrees pay off and what you should opt for considering your strengths and talents. 
 Therefore,  before you start, we  recommend you to bear in mind that given the high cost of tuition in both public and private institutions, you cannot afford to choose a job that will never truly pay off. 
 That is why so many young people these days postpone marriage and starting a family: they cannot afford any of that due to the huge student loans they have to deal with. 
 The Simple Dollar reports that there are ten degrees that can ensure that you will tackle the dangerous burden of a student loan, as finding a job in these areas is possible. Among the recommended degrees are Computer Science, Marketing, Health Care Administration, Finances, and Civil Engineering. 
 Meanwhile, your worst choices, according to the same source, would be obtaining a degree in Psychology, Fashion, Fine Arts, Hospitality, and Theatre Arts. The author states that getting a job in this area will be hard and the income will not be sufficient both to pay off the loan and start a family. 
 But do not pick your major based on its profitability alone. You need to take your strengths and weaknesses into account to make the right choice. Otherwise, you are at risk of choosing a profitable niche but failing to make the most out of it due to the lack of talent in the area. 
 How can you identify your biggest strengths? With a simple aptitude test. We have gathered a list of the best aptitude tests we have found online so that you can choose the one you like the most and give it a try. 
 4 Free Aptitude Tests for Students 
 
 __ Career Fitter 
 
 This test is claimed to be among the most popular tests since 1998. The goal of this test is to see what work fits your personality better. Besides, it creates your inner portrait and shows how well you can work in a team. It also describes what work environment will be perfect for you based on your strengths and preferred management style. And finally, you get to see what famous people had the same result on this test as you do. 
 This test consists of 30 questions that look into your personality one inch at a time and try to evaluate what company you should work for. 
 The test was developed by scientists as an attempt to help young people who are not sure of  what career path to pursue . So, if this description is close to what you experience in your life right now, then take this free test to get help in figuring out what major to pursue. 
 
 __ Similar Minds  **  . ** 
 
 Another test to help you figure out what career choices are the best for you is called Similar Minds Career Builder. 
 This test consists of 55 questions, and when answering them, you need to specify whether the suggested statement is “Very inaccurate” or “Very accurate”. 
 There is always the risk of answering in a way that you believe is ideal in this case instead of telling the truth. However, such an approach can only ruin things for you. 
 You will never figure out what professions fit you the most if you answer in a way that is not typical of you. So, when going through this test, make sure to look at yourself from the side and give answers that reflect your current (and not ideal) opinion the best. 
 Some of the questions in this test aim to identify your personality while other focus on your professional skills. All this is made in an attempt to look at your personality from different angles and get a better and more realistic image of you and your best career. 
 
 __ Skills Profiler  **  . ** 
 
 This tool aims to identify your skills and traits and match them to the potential job options. Not only you get to understand yourself better and see what exact skills you have that you can use in your future career but you also get a link to a special feature called Employer Locator with the names of the best employers in your area. 
 Besides, one can even compare the occupations selected for them by the app and the desired positions to see the differences and similarities in skills and qualifications. 
 And as a bonus feature, with this knowledge, preparing for an interview will no longer be a daunting task. You can write a resume and attach a personalized cover letter with no problems at all, as you will know what qualities and skills you have to work with. 
 
 Career Colleges. 
 
 A perfect short aptitude test that only consists of 15 questions that aim to identify your inner strengths and qualities that make you stand out of the crowd. When answering them, you shouldn’t be over-thinking them too much, as you will fail to answer correctly. On the contrary, make sure to give answers that first pop up in your head. Such answers are most likely to be “real.” 
 Each question has five answer options that go from completely negative to neutral and positive. You need to pick the one that best describes your opinion about certain things. Do not try to look perfect or ideal, as that is not who you are. Finding an ideal career for a person you think is ideal will not help you in your future career search. 
 Submit your answers and get an extensive description of your work personality and what occupations are your best choices. 
 Taking an aptitude test is a great idea for students that have doubts about their future career path. You might have too many talents to start with or on the contrary see nothing particular in yourself. Both these approaches hinder your prospects. So, get an objective opinion from an unbiased source and see what your best options are. 
 Understanding where you should move will help you stay focused on one or two subjects and invest the most of your time and energy in them. And this can be a great way to succeed in your special field. You can read  causal argument essay topics  to understand what you need. 
 If you have taken some other aptitude test and you were really satisfied with the results, then don’t hesitate to share it with us in the comments section. Your experience can help many other students, so do share how you came to a clear understanding of what path to choose for your career.
