 Conquer your job search ​ with our 
JumpStart Your Job Search 
4-session package 
 ---|--- 
 JumpStart Your Job Search will equip you with everything you need to confidently conduct an effective job search, and get hired in your ideal role. 
 ​ 
​Perfect for anyone who is returning to work after a career break or back at work and wanting to find something new, my JumpStart Your Job Search package includes 4 x 90 minute job search consulting sessions, each tailored to you. 
 What do you get? 
 During our time working together you will get: 
 
 An understanding of the current job search market. How have things changed in recent years and what does this mean for you? 
 A personalised  job search strategy (including ways of tapping into the hidden job market, working your network and the job search resources available to you ) and action plan so you are clear on exactly what you need to do, how you are going to do it, and when. 
 An understanding of personal branding and why it is so important to your job search. What do you need to do to make your personal brand shine and stand out from the crowd?​ 
 A CV and cover letter that looks great, sounds great and is tailored to the job you want. 
 Knowledge of how to use and optimise LinkedIn to support your job search, and a perfectly perfected LinkedIn profile. 
 Interview skill techniques and answers to all those tricky interview questions about time you have spent out of the workplace to raise a family, and your home/ family life. 
 
 And not only this, you'll also come away with: 
 
 Weekly accountability emails from me to keep your job search on track. 
 A bundle of handouts, including job search tools and templates. 
 All your burning job search questions answered - the best way of 'minding the gap' on your CV, when and how to ask for flexibility during the application process, and many more. ​ 
 A HUGE boost to your job search confidence.
