 Redesign website using Wordpress Elementor 
 Published: 10 months ago  Deadline: 10 Bids: 6 
 I am looking to redesign a website:  gentlesleepgenie.com 
 - I'd like it to look very similar to the following website:  https://helpbabysleep.co.uk/ 
- I will provide full requirements on text / etc. There are a total of 6 pages: Home, About us, Services, Testimonials, Blog, and Contact Us 
- I'd like it to be designed in Elementor as it is easier for me to customize later. 
- I need standard connections to Mailchimp for my newsletter, Google Analytics, contact form, and I am currently connected to an appointment scheduling system 
- I also need a sleep quiz that will sit on the website. 
 I'd like to create something similar to this: 
 https://www.learningtosleep.co.uk/sleep-test 
 So in summary, the user answers a few questions (which I'll provide), and then when they submit 
 a) They register to my Mailchimp newsletter 
b) We send them an email with their test result 
 - The result will be a score (each question will assign some points depending on their answer) 
- Some text depending on the total score(depending on the range of the score) 
- Some other text depending on specific answers to the questionnaire

 Clean existing web design 
 Published: 10 months ago  Bids: 4 
 I have a car classifieds website that's a bit off in terms of design and needs some cleaning. No major reprogramming work required. Mainly change in colors, fonts, button sizes, margins, etc. 
 All that is required is front end work with almost no back-end development. Website is bi-lingual (English and Arabic) and changes need to apply to both languages (rtl and ltr). Requirements are all available. 
 Best person fit for the job is someone with superior design skills and has a strong sense for design. What I am NOT looking for is someone with excellent programming skills and average design capabilities but rather someone with excellent design capabilities - programming skills is a plus.
