The Bottom of a Bottle 
 Trust me, I've been there, I've looked, I've searched and I know now, that there are no answers to be found in the bottom of a bottle or on the edge of a blade! Fighting Hard, Recovering, Rebuilding, REBORN. Moving on from addiction to a new life.

 As Quick As Time Passes – Job 11:18 
 As quick as time passes 
 Hope builds a way 
 All mistakes of a life 
 Grace will wipe away 
 If time erases the will 
 Hope and grace build a future 
 Turning the lostness of our thoughts 
 To a secure future in the Lord 
 
 Job 11:18

 Beyond The Fear – Job 11:18

 Beyond The Fear – Job 11:18 
 To shiver and to shake 
 We tremble in our fear 
 Anxiety and anguish 
 At the centre of our bones 
 Yet with just a glance 
 Just one look 
 At the One who holds the world 
 We see a future secure 
 A hope beyond our trembling 
 So never give in 
 Rest within Him when needed 
 For a time is to come 
 When the fear will be no more 
 And we hold the hope 
 In which our future has been secured 
 
 Job 11:18

 The Circle (Job 11:18)

 The Circle (Job 11:18) 
 I’ve sat within the circle 
 Surrounded by only fear 
 I felt the circle close in 
 Until the fear choked my lungs 
 Still the Lord came to my side 
 And tore the walls of fear down 
 In His presence I could breathe again 
 My heart felt so secure 
 Now I’m at the centre of hope 
 All around me is His love 
 And here I rest in the midst of it all 
 Safe here beneath His wings

 Have Hope (Job 11:18) 
 Whatever lies ahead 
 Have hope 
 In light of what you face 
 Hold tight to your hope 
 Even in your darkest hour 
 Sing a song of hope 
 When it seems there is no way 
 Have hope 
 Just lift your eyes my friend 
 Have hope

 Verse of the Day - Job 11-18

 Job 11:18 
 Just a reminder, whatever lies ahead, have hope. 
 THE HOPE THAT LIES IN YOU by THE GLORIOUS UNSEEN 
 We can hear the sound of all creation sing 
 A song to heal the earth 
 A song to spark a dream. 
 Where are you optimists? 
 We need your strength in this. 
 There 's a stirring in your soul that cannot be controlled. 
 This is the hope that lies in you. 
 We can hear the sound of all the earth rejoice 
 With angels all around - lifting up their voice. 
 Where are you hopeful ones? 
 Have we come undone? 
 There 's a stirring in your soul that cannot be controlled. 
 This is the hope that lies in you. 
 Through all the questioning, you 've been the hope in me. 
 Despite uncertainty, you 've been the only constant thing. 
 When I 'm struggling, you keep on loving me the same. 
 This is the hope that lies in you. 
 Come Down - we need your hope to come down. 
 We need your grace to pour out. 
 We need your love to shine down. 
 We need the face of God now.
