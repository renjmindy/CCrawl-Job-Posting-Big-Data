 Who’s “Qualified”? Defending Essential Job Functions, Qualification Standards, and Performance Requirements under the ADA 
 $189.00 
 In passing this landmark legislation, Congress promised the business community that the ADA would NOT (a) require employers to fundamentally alter their positions to fit the limitations of disabled applicants or workers; (b) force employers to modify job-related performance and/or qualification standards; (c) allow the EEOC to substitute its judgment for employers’ about minimally successful job performance; (d) mandate “reasonable accommodations” that interfere with operations or impose crushing expense. 
 The EEOC’s more recent ADA prosecutions, however, have systemically broken each of these promises. How far must an employer go to REASONABLY accommodate an employee’s “disability,” before concluding that that s/he simply cannot perform essential job functions with or without REASONABLE accommodation and is, therefore, not “qualified” within the meaning of the ADA?
