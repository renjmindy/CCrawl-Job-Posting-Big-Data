 Career bucketlist ideas 
 Madlena Mincheva 
 
 It is that time of the year when people usually create their wishlist with things they would like to achieve during the next year. Here you can find some popular career goals. 
 
 
 Get a promotion 
 
 
 Demonstrate you are a good professional, be proactive, talk to your manager at the annual appraisals sessions about your future career development, apply for the positions advertised internally
2. ###  Ask for a pay raise 
 The pay raise is one of the main incentives at work. Do a previous research about pay rates at other companies for your position. Make sure you can justify your request presenting your achievements.
3. ###  Start your own business 
 Being an entrepreneur has never been so easy and trendy. There are thousands of programs and entrepreneurship events around the world to help you start and grow your business.
4. ###  Create a passive income stream 
 Making some extra money without putting much effort sounds really tempting. Renting an apartment, sell stuff on Ebay, make money from ads on your site are only a few of the  ideas   how to create a passive income stream
5. ###  Clean / Redecorate your desk 
 Remove all unnecessary papers, put all your tools in order, add an element that will make you relax and smile when you look at it
6. ###  Redecorate your office 
 Make your office a comfortable and nice place to spend your workday there. Check what ideas people are sharing about how to make the office a nice workplace 
7. ###  Change your job 
 If you feel stuck at your job and you are not motivated to continue within the same company, you can always find another career path. Check how to create a successful  job search strategy 
8. ###  Enrich your CV 
 A new language course or a new skill added to your CV are always a plus.
9. ###  Turn your hobby into a job 
 Working what you love is the dream of most people. Think how you could monetize your hobbies and get into action. Assisting any of the start-up events could help you generate many ideas.
10. ###  Become a millionaire 
 Another top dream. No recipe here ðŸ™‚
11. ###  Balance work-personal life 
 If all your time is dedicated to your job, you will eventually burn out. Having the balance between work and personal life will recharge you and make you much more productive and happier. 
12. ###  Do not be late for work/meetings 
 If you are often late for work/meetings, it might affect in a negative way your appraisal and for sure your colleagues who always try to be on time might complain.
