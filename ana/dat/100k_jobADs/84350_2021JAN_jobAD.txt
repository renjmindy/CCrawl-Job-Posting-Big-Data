 Jobs: A Forced Necessity 
 Posted by Inverted_Jesus July 30, 2020July 30, 2020 Posted in Jobs ,  Topics ,  Uncategorized 
 I look forward to a future where people take the things some of us view as privileges today for granted. Things like healthcare, clean water, food, acquit shelter, and the ability to pursue ones hopes, passions and dreams, and those things shouldn't be some distant pipe dream, it should be the standard. People should be free to create, and pursue what ever they please, nothing should stand in anyone's way when it comes to that. Nothing forced, no teasing people by holding their basic needs and rights over their heads and then barley giving what they work for to begin with, no excuses. We can do a lot better as a species, We need to. 
 If you need to know what counts as basic needs and rights, please refer to the chart and link that follows below it.
