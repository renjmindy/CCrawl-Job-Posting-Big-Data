 June 5, 2015June 5, 2015 Eileen Kohan 
 Poet  Gary Soto 's work reflects his experience growing up in the San Joaquin Valley of Central California. _" I’m one who provides portraits of people in the rush of life." _In his poem, 'Self-Inquiry Before the Job Interview', originally published in the  July, 2001 issue  of Poetry magazine and later included in the collection,  'One Kind of Faith' , he shares his perspective of job search. 
 The Friday poem is for all of you getting up this morning, heading out and hoping to find work. 
 Self-Inquiry Before the Job Interview 
 Did you sneeze? 
Yes, I rid myself of the imposter inside me. 
 Did you iron your shirt? 
Yes, I used the steam of mother's hate. 
 Did you wash your hands? 
Yes, I learned my hygiene from a raccoon. 
 I prayed on my knees, and my knees answered with pain. 
I gargled. I polished my shoes until I saw who I was. 
I inflated my résumé by employing my middle name. 
 I walked to my interview, early, 
The sun like a ring on an electric stove. 
I patted my hair when I entered the wind of a revolving door. 
The guard said, For a guy like you, it's the 19th floor. 
 The economy was up. Flags whipped in every city plaza 
In America. This I saw for myself as I rode the elevator, 
Empty because everyone had a job but me. 
 Did you clean your ears? 
Yes, I heard my fate in the drinking fountain's idiotic drivel. 
 Did you slice a banana into your daily mush? 
I added a pinch of salt, two raisins to sweeten my breath. 
 Did you remember your pen? 
I remembered my fingers when the elevator opened. 
 I shook hands that dripped like a dirty sea. 
I found a chair and desk. My name tag said my name. 
Through the glass ceiling, I saw the heavy rumps of CEOs. 
Outside my window, the sun was a burning stove, 
All of us pushing papers 
To keep it going. 
 Gary Soto  2001
