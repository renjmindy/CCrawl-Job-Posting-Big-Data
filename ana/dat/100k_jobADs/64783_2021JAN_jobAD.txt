 Job 1 
 1 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil. 
 2 And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. 
 3 His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east. 
 4 And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. 
 5 And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually. 
 6 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them. 
 7 And the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. 
 8 And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? 
 9 Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought? 
 10 Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. 
 11 But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face. 
 12 And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord. 
 13 And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house: 
 14 And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them: 
 15 And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 
 16 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 
 17 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 
 18 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house: 
 19 And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 
 20 Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped, 
 21 And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord. 
 22 In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.

 Verse 5 NLT "When these celebrations ended—sometimes after several days—Job would purify his children. He would get up early in the morning and offer a burnt offering for each of them. For Job said to himself, “Perhaps my children have sinned and have cursed God in their hearts.” This was Job’s regular practice." We too must get in the regular practice to cover our children in prayer. 
 Verses 20-22 NLT "Job stood up and tore his robe in grief. Then he shaved his head and fell to the ground to worship. He said, "I came naked from my mother’s womb, and I will be naked when I leave. The Lord gave me what I had, and the Lord has taken it away. Praise the name of the Lord!” In all of this, Job did not sin by blaming God." Wow, what an awesome relationship Job had with the Lord. He knew that the Lord had blessed him tremendously with all that he had and understood it was not his to begin with. Talk about praising in the middle of your storm! Job could have had a pity party; but, instead he chose to praise his Provider and Maker. What a testimony.

 It doesn't matter how old our children get they will still need an interceder. This is a wonderful habit to start every morning. What impact can it have if we start the day fighting back the darkness and sanctifying our children?

 iLove to Grow in the Word 
Job 1:4 Job’s sons would take turns preparing feasts in their homes, and they would also invite their three sisters to celebrate with them. 5When these celebrations ended—sometimes after several days—Job would purify his children. He would get up early in the morning and offer a burnt offering for each of them. For Job said to himself, “Perhaps my children have sinned and have cursed God in their hearts.” This was Job’s regular practice. 
 Wow, Job loved his family so much that he sacrificed his time, talent, and treasure for them. Waking up early and going through the blood bath of sacrificing 10 animals from the barn each and every time they had their feasts. That's alot of work, alot of time, alot of money, and alot of faith. 
 Can you imagine the thoughts that would race through his mind as the messenger came and told him that his children were dead…Thoughts from the enemy accusing God of not really hearing his prayer and not honoring the sacrifices for his children. Job could have thought, "I sacrifice all this time, talant, and treasure for the Lord and it's all for nothing…my children are dead…" 
 But Job did not think like the majority of us think like…He did not blame God or do backslide because his children died…He humbled himself and turned to God instead of running away from God.

 In verse 21 Job's immediate reaction of course is grief, then his first words to God are praise. What an example… How would we react, how would we respond, what would our first words to God be in the midst of such trials?

 “Then the LORD asked Satan, “Have you noticed my servant Job? He is the finest man in all the earth. He is blameless—a man of complete integrity. He fears God and stays away from evil.”” 
‭‭Job‬ ‭1:8‬ ‭NLT 
 Job's faithfulness had the attention of God! Are we living in such a way that we have the attention of God? Is our faithfulness and desire to stay away from sin where it should be? We must live our life here in righteousness that one day we may hear those words, well done my good and faithful servant!!

 It's crazy that the devil himself has to wait in line, like the rest of them. He isn't allowed to do something until God approved or allows it. 
 “One day the members of the heavenly court came to present themselves before the LORD, and the Accuser, Satan, came with them. “Where have you come from?” the LORD asked Satan. Satan answered the LORD, “I have been patrolling the earth, watching everything that’s going on.””

 Keeping our children and family covered with prayer is a daily habit we must strive for if we aren't already doing that for them. You never know what might happen in their day, but your prayers will be their help in time of need. Job's attitude in his time of loss is such a great example too…worship in the good times and the bad.

 GUARD THE HEART 
 5 And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually. 
 Job was a BLESSED and FAITHFUL man, he worshipped GOD and taught his family to do the same. However in the wisdom of Job, he prepared himself to look deeper into the lives of his children. He offer sacrifice for them while they were in their folly. 
 Just in case: the sinned and cursed God in their hearts. Obvioulsly it is possible at family feasts and dinner settings such as Christmas Dinner to sin and curse God in our hearts. The topics of discussion or the activities participated in could very well lead to sin and rebellion or resentment toward GOD. 
 Proverbs 4:23 Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life. 
 We must not allow murmuring, complaining, gossip, accusation or resentment to rise in our hearts and become a hinderance to our sensitivity to the spirit and will of GOD. If we allow resentment we will curse God in times of trouble. We must prayerfully keep our heart pure before GOD. No resentment, no grudges, no bitterness. 
 Confessing always "GOD is GOOD" "His Mercy Endures Forever" "He will make a WAY".

 When i first opened this chapter this morning, a great shame fell on me and then great Joy feeled my heart. This man lost everything but didnt doubt or ask God why. Instead he prayed. In our situations, we must pray before the devil puts doubt in our minds. God wont bring you to a situation that He cant bring you out of. I must grow during my trials and let God be God.

7) And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. 
8) And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? 
 Have you every asked God the question, "Why? Why Me?" 
Well we all know that our "adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour." (1 Peter 5:8) Just as he did in Job's day, he's still doing it today. 
God knows what your made of. So just perhaps God has asked the devil, "Hey, have you considered my servant _______?" (You fill in the blank). 
We all go through trials and tests in our lives (some are harder to go through than others it seems), but the most important thing we can do is to be like Job and WORSHIP and BE FAITHFUL to God through the trials and tests. 
 WORSHIP & BE FAITHFUL TO GOD!!

 Even though Job has had lost everything, he still has blessed the Lord. He was very hurt about it but he still put his trust in God! Although life throws some hard blows, we cannot forget our creator, the one who calms the storms and at any given moment can say PEACE BE STILL and know that I am your God. 
 Trust in the Lord it all you heart and lean not unto your own understanding.

 A Roosters Work is Never Done 
 “Job would get up early in the morning and sacrifice a burnt offering for each of his children, thinking, “Maybe one of them sinned by defying God inwardly.” Job made a habit of this sacrificial atonement, just in case they’d sinned.” 
‭‭Job‬ ‭1:5 MSG‬‬ 
 My grandfather used to say that a roosters work was never done all the time. I thought it a funny saying until I became a rooster myself. A father never stops thinking about his wide and kids. Where are they? Why have they not called? When will they be home? Rent is due and the account is a little short; what now? 
 Job prayed for his kids like any father would. However, he took it one step further and prayed for their for sins his kids may have done in their mind or unknowingly. What a great concept. 
 Prayer - Just in Case. 
 How well protected our children can be if we adopt a prayer practice such as this; not only foe our kids but all our loves ones.

 Why do we argue with one another over material things when none of it belongs to us anyway. Everything and every creature belongs to God. Who are we to tell him what to do with them?

 Notice God grants Satan access to "all that he hath." Yet Job's life was not his own. It belonged to God. This should be a strong warning to to us; if we are not willing to give Him total access to our lives we may be setting ourselves up to lose our life at the hand of the enemy.

 God had a plan to bless Job. It looks like it was the enemy's idea of mess him up but really it was God who led the enemy, who put the thought it his mind to do this. 
 God knows the end from the beginning. If the devil is involved it doesn't mean we have failed but that God is setting us up for victory.

 The "angels" referred to here are spiritual beings, literally "sons of God" in Hebrew. Created by God to operate as officials in the kingdom to do his bidding. Strange then that Satan, an adversary of God, is allowed to enter this holy council. Here Satan, " the accuser" appears here in his role of celestial spy, duty bound to report to God and accuse men on basis of their behavior. Ultimately, all the officials in the Kings court, including God's "fallen angel" are subject to his will and direction. Satan may have access to God and to God's servants, like Job, but he is only allowed to do as the Lord allows. Satan may challenge God that Job would curse him if he wasn't so blessed with God's covering and protection. Even when the enemy comes in like a flood like he will Job, their will be a standard lifted against him.

 When we stay in righteousness God can speak to Satan the same way he does of Job. Have you seen my church Satan? They are Apostolic, Holy Ghost filled, baptized in Jesus name, holiness, oneness, devoted to me a bride without spot or blemish. We are the ones God is coming back for and feels good to show that in the face of our accuser.

 Satan can't do anything without the Lords approval. God is the one that has the final say in everything. He controls everything in this world, yet we still have a choice to make if we truly trust in God or not. Our decision is what sometimes stops God from doing what He wants to do with us because of our own selfishness. God doesn't let us go through things to fail but to build us and mold us. Help us see in the spiritual Lord!!!! Help us understand and learn from the seasons that we go through. If God is with us who can be against us.

 Job 1:3 and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East. 
 So how rich was Job? 
 Mogama of SearchWarp calculated the value of that livestock in 2009 dollars, coming up with a total of almost $5.3 million in animals alone, not counting his property and other possible assets. With wealth like that in that time, Mogama claims Job would have been up there with today's "Bill Gates, William Buffet, and Oprah Winfrey all rolled up in one." 
 Today 
Bill Gates $84.1 billion 
William Buffet $62 billion 
Oprah Winfrey $2.9 billion 
 Job certainly had a lot of material wealth. The way God describes Job tells me that wealth came be achieved without compromising your integrity. After his great loss, Job showed the jewel to his character, his breakable loyalty to God. He refused to falter no matter what came his way, nothing was more valuable, not even his children, than God. 
 What an amazing demonstration of character, love, and integrity.

 12 And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.

 5 When these celebrations ended—sometimes after several days—Job would purify his children. He would get up early in the morning and offer a burnt offering for each of them. For Job said to himself, “Perhaps my children have sinned and have cursed God in their hearts.” This was Job’s regular practice. 
 A great example of a father praying for his family. As fathers, we are the head of our household, and should pray daily for our family to guard and protect our family.
