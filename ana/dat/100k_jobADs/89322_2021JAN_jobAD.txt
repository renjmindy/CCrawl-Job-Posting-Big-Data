 Full-stack Engineer (front-end/back-end/distributed systems/Go/React/Cloud) for cancer research at UCL 
 Role overview 
 GRAIL UK is looking for experienced full-stack engineers to join its engineering team in London. Responsible for supporting clinical trials in the UK which are a collaborative effort between GRAIL and its research partners (NHS/UCL), you will work as part of a cross-functional team to design, develop and run systems that power the safe execution of clinical workflows and the collection of relevant data. Your work will support academic cancer research in the UK and the development of GRAILs multi-cancer early detection blood test, directly affecting the lives of people in the UK and beyond. 
 You Will: 
 
 Use your experience developing front-end applications and distributed systems to build software that supports clinical trials in the UK. 
 Work as part of a cross-functional team to overcome real-world problems that sometimes canâ€™t be solved with software alone. 
 Build and operate the infrastructure and tooling that runs the systems and powers the team. 
 Work with GRAIL engineers in the United States on core platforms. 
 Take responsibility for the systems managed by the team and support the operational concerns of our research partners. 
 
 Your Background Includes: 
 
 You have a Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, Electrical Engineering, Bioinformatics or similar technical field. 
 You have 7+ years of relevant work experience designing, developing, testing and maintaining software. 
 You have experience working with cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, or Microsoft Azure. 
 You are experienced in general purpose programming languages such as Go, Python, Java, Javascript, etc, but understand that ultimately these are tools to solve problems. 
 You are passionate about software engineering, as well as software engineering teams. 
 You have excellent logical reasoning and analytical skills, with a preference for simple solutions. 
 You are a strong written and verbal communicator and are able to adapt your communication style and the level of detail to your audience.
