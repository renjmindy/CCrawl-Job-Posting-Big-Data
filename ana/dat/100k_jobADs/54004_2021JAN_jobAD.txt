 Gleeson Recruitment Group are working with a growing retail organisation in Birmingham who are looking for a Finance Manager to join their team. The Finance Manager will have an initial focus on implementing new and improving current processes within the month end routine, and leading the management accounting team ensuring accuracy and that all deadlines are met. 
 This is a great opportunity for a confident Management Accountant with at least 18 months post Qualified (ACA, ACCA or CIMA) to develop their management experience - the role will be leading a team of two and needs an ambitious individual who is not afraid to be hands on and enjoys working in a fast paced environment. 
 The business is based on the outskirts of Central Birmingham with easy access to the M6, and parking available on site. 
 This role will report into a driven Financial Controller who is willing to offer as much exposure as someone can take on, with an aim of eventually taking on their role. The role could be a great fit for an accountant who wants to take on more ownership and start to develop managerial experience on the path to FC. 
 The environment is fast paced and will suit an individual who enjoys a busy workload and wants to understand what "the numbers" mean and is keen to provide recommendations on how to improve. Internal and external relationships will need to be developed to ensure projects are financially viable.
