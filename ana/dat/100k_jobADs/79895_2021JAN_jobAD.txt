 Today 's team review is from Karen , she blogs here  https://mytrainofthoughtson.wordpress.com 
 
 Karen has been reading  My New Superjob by Anton Eine 
 This book focuses on an interview between “Mark” and Samantha, the latter being in dire need of a paying job. 
 With  “My New Superjob”  , Anton Eine has created a very funny short story with more than a superhero touch. The story was initially planned to be just one short story – this would have been our (the readers’) loss. This short story comprises two believable characters with sufficient depth and hilarious dialogue. I had a great time reading  “My New Superjob”  – it is a very fun read. I was drawn into the story right away, getting closer to Samantha, page by page. I am looking forward to reading more! 
 This is for you if you like female protagonists, great – and fun – dialogue, as well as the superhero topic. 
 A fun and somehow suspenseful short story to read again; it is the very promising first in a new series. 
 Recommended. 
 
 Did you ever want to be a superhero? The city's defender against crime, violence, and all forms of sicko nastiness? 
When one day she stumbled upon a strange help wanted ad claiming that the city was looking for a superhero, Samantha Washington, a former Ranger commander, was sure it was a joke. And she sent in her resume. 
Will the ad turn out to be somebody's dumb idea of a joke, a practical stunt, a cunning maniac's clever trap, or… a real opportunity leading to a difficult and dangerous future occupation? 
Now that she has let herself be drawn inextricably into the chain of events, Samantha will have to figure it all out on her own. And she’ll have to do it face to face with her own deepest fears.
