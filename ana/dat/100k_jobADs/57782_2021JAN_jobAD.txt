 Muscles (UK) Team complete garden clearance -> 
 First Job of 2020! 
 Posted on  February 7, 2020  by  georgebentleymfc 
 On Saturday 18 January, four MFC volunteers attended ’Shedquarters’ and completed necessary maintenance work that had resulted when recent storms had ripped the felt from the roof, saturated the boards underneath and caused water ingress. 
   
   
 The roof of the shed was lifted off, discarded and replaced with new materials that will hopefully see us through the next few years. 
   
   
 Whilst there, the gardening tools were sorted out and tidied - with some being put aside for donation to Tools With A Mission - and the shed was treated with a couple of 
 additional coats of water-based stain.
