 Dr. Yaba Blay's take on Beyonc√©'s 'Formation' 
 February 10, 2016December 27, 2016 Community Village Team 2 Comments 
 
 "‚Ä¶ I cringe when I hear her chant,  ‚ÄúYou mix that Negro with that Creole make a Texas bamma‚Äù  about her Alabama-born dad and her mom from Louisiana. This is the same reason I cringed at the  L‚ÄôOreal ad  that identified Beyonce as African-American, Native American and French."

 There is a fine line between affirming mixed race people and bashing mono-race people. 
 I agree with Dr. Blay's sentiment. 
 Bragging about being mixed race is akin to bragging about being mono-raced. Race is not a thing to be proud about. It is no accomplishment to be born. A person may prefer a certain skin color, but as Brenda says:  Your preference is not preferable .

 Beyonce: Formation 
 February 9, 2016December 27, 2016 Community Village Team 2 Comments 
 
 "Formation" (2016) is a song and music video by Beyonce. It appeared out of the blue on a Saturday afternoon, February 6th - the day before the Super Bowl, where she performed it to kick off her hitherto-unknown world tour. 
 In one glorious scene, a little boy, unarmed, in a hoodie, appears before a line of policemen ‚Äì who put  their  hands up!

 In memoriam: David Bowie 
 January 12, 2016December 27, 2016 Community Village Team Leave a comment 
 
 
 David Bowie (1947-2016) passed away on Sunday after a long battle with cancer. He was 69. According to the (not-fact-checked) comments on this blog: He is best known as the husband of Iman Abdulmajid, a black model. He is white, she is dark. She escaped from Africa at age 12 because they were going to sew‚Ä¶

 Sade - Why can't we live Together ? - Montreux Jazz Festival ( 1984 ) 
 November 4, 2015February 23, 2016 Community Village Team Leave a comment 
 "This is  Sade's  cover of  the Timmy Thomas song  of the same name that went to #1 on the US R&B chart in 1972. Her cover appeared as the last song on her first album, "Diamond Life" (1984). In the video above she sings it at  an anti-apartheid concert  at Clapham Common in London in 1986. 
Santana has also  covered  this song. Drake samples it heavily in  "Hotline Bling " (2015), currently at #1 on the US R&B chart."

 Martha Redbone Roots Project: The Garden of Love [MUSIC VIDEO] 
 November 24, 2014December 23, 2014 Glenn (freedom of movement) Robinson @glncv Leave a comment 
 
 Remarks: 
 This is from Martha Redbone's 2012 album "The Garden of Love" where she sings the poetry of William Blake. She is from Appalachia, part Black, White and Native (Cherokee, Choctaw) and so is her music, though she does sing some straight R&B (like  "Boyfriehd" and  "Children of Love" ). In 2002 she won a Nammy (Native American music award) for Debut Artist.  As maybe you can imagine , she has been on  NPR .

 ahhh!!! i'm pretty much bursting 
 so i'll get right to it ‚Ä¶ 
 i realize as i'm writing this that i NEVER share love life things (except in the music of course, ha!), so here goes ‚Ä¶ the most twinkly, GLORIOUS, heart-full thing happened. i got married üòÄ on September 13th family and friends descended upon my east coast home town from all over the country and the world to help Luke (that's my love!) and me celebrate starting our adventures together. we feel SO wildly blessed to have such a crazy, hilarious, generous, supportive and loving tribe of friends and family around us. it was perfect.
