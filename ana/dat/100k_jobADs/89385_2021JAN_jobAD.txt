 For wpd, socially aware treatment of the environment also means being aware of the people who contribute to the growth of the company on a daily basis. We know that our employees represent our greatest strength and we therefore want them to feel good about coming to work, throw themselves into their work with a passion and to be able to stand up for what they do every day. Good performance can only be expected if it is based on mutual confidence and respect, strengths are individually fostered and our colleagues feel at ease: 
 
 We want to make your entry as easy as possible for you. That’s why you will receive thorough training and introductory days. 
 They will form the basis for your long-term work in a meaningful and forward-looking working environment. 
 Working with colleagues and contacts from abroad will open up new perspectives. 
 We appreciate a positive atmosphere in the company. For us, it is a given that we establish a good working relationship with each other and that we have an open ear for questions or problems – including when we go out together after work. 
 If you stay fit, you will feel it not only in your free time but also in your everyday work. Whether it’s our wide-ranging offers of company fitness or bicycle hire: we want to help you feel physically well.
