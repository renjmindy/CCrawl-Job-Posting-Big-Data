 @rohit28 , welcome to the WFH forums! We are glad you are here. 
 If I understand your question correctly, there are several ways to find specific work from home jobs. 
 
 I would use the built-in search feature on the site and use keywords such as Data Entry or Tech Support, etc. 
 You can use this link to see all the tag we put in place for all the job postings:  https://workremotelyfromhome.com/tag/  or a specific tag for Tech Support:  https://workremotelyfromhome.com/tag/tech-support 
 You can just visit the Latest Work From Home Jobs category where we post all the jobs:  Work From Home Jobs - Work Remotely From Home Forum
