 THOUGHTS ON A CAREER 
 BY VASA CLARKE 
 Come off it, then! What  is  your future plan? 
You’re in good health– your future’s gleaming bright! 
Do tell me, are you now a businessman 
Who makes great piles and does cocaine at night? 
 No, sir. I aim to live beneath a bridge 
And hike to Florida when it gets cold; 
Beneath the arches, I will make my home 
And pass my days alone, til I grow old.
