 Join Our Team 
 Workspace is a fun, vibrant work environment with a tight knit team of people.  We all work hard every day and enjoy a fast paced and rewarding workplace. Located on the ground floor of the Lithia HQ building in the Commons we are within walking distance of coffee shops, restaurants and breweries. We are always looking for motivated, quick learning people to jump right into the world of commercial furniture. If you have an interest in or experience with design or space planning that is a definite plus. Workspace is growing both in this market and across the country and there is plenty of room to grow with us. 
 "This is an exciting opportunity to work with a small local company with the financial security and perks of a larger corporation."
