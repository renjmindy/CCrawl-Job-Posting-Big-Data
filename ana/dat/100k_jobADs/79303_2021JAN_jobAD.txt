 Help us build our global network for recurring payments 
 Role overview 
 If youâ€™re looking to work in a collaborative culture, solving engineering challenges at a global scale, and having a real impact in making our products better for our customers, we would love to talk to you! 
 Weâ€™re currently looking for an experienced Full Stack Software Engineer to work across our stack with a focus on the Frontend, working with ReactJS. 
 We believe in providing trust and autonomy so everyone can do their best work. From how we work to how managers support you, our goal is to provide an environment that enables you to continuously grow, ask questions and not be afraid to failâ€”because when we do, we see it as an opportunity to learn. 
 **  Engineering @ GoCardless: ** 
 The technical challenges of building GoCardless span from simplifying building banking schemes to optimising the time to render the dashboard. Weâ€™re looking for engineers to join our growing Global Network Group, where youâ€™ll be working on problems that sit at the core of GoCardless: orchestrating and keeping track of the movement of funds, as well as building and maintaining the bank and scheme integrations that make it possible to keep our merchantsâ€™ cash flowing. 
 You will enjoy being a software engineer at GoCardless if: 
 
 Youâ€™re looking to champion a great engineering culture within GC and in the wider engineering community; 
 You enjoy collaborating and learning from people from various backgrounds and experiences; 
 You want to feel proud of the work youâ€™re doing and its impact on real customers. 
 
 Our engineers contribute to the engineering culture within and outside of GoCardless: they contribute to Open Source Software projects (see our  Github ), and share learnings in  post-mortems , conferences and on  our blog . 
 Our technologies  : We endeavour to build simple, reliable systems and we believe in using the best technologies for each task. Joining the Global Network Group youâ€™ll be working in a team that primarily uses: Ruby on Rails, ReactJS, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, BigQuery, and Google Cloud Storage. 
 Youâ€™re not expected to have expertise in all these technologies. Members of our team have picked up the tools once theyâ€™ve started working with the team. If youâ€™re unsure, please apply. 
 **  About You: ** 
 
 You have experience building web products and services, and have an awareness of technologies across the stack. 
 You adapt to new technologies and processes quickly. 
 You thrive in a collaborative environment and believe the best products are built through collaboration. 
 You care about building reliable, well-tested systems. 
 You enjoy solving problems and are happy to take initiative to find better solutions. 
 You enjoy mentoring and supporting the development of team members and colleagues
