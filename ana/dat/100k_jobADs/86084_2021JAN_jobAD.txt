  10 Things To Know About A Retail Management Career  
 Adept Marketing

 May 13, 2020 
 If you are already on the path to becoming a retail manager or are simply considering it, here are some important and interesting things to consider before embarking upon a retail management career. 
 
 1. You Must Have The Right Personality 
 Compare your traits to those commonly found in successful retail managers. 
 
 Results-oriented 
 Ability to motivate, train, and develop others 
 Strong customer service skills 
 Natural leader 
 Patient 
 Cheerful 
 Good communicator 
 Professional 
 Good listener 
 Strong negotiator 
 
 2. Retail Management Is More Than Just Sales 
 Retail managers oversee everything that makes a store work, from behind the scenes functions (such as buying, inventory, and merchandising) to the sales floor (such as sales and customer service). Some common tasks you can expect to perform during your retail management career include: 
 
 Hiring, managing, and motivating a team to increase sales 
 Overseeing vendors and the buying process 
 Managing inventory 
 Creating and maintaining store displays 
 Developing and executing sales and promotions 
 Analyzing market trends and researching competitors 
 Monitoring sales figures and forecasting future sales volumes, and meeting sales quotas 
 Dealing with questions, complaints, and comments from customers 
 Monitoring budgets, controlling expenses, and maximizing profits 
 
 3. Experience Drives Growth 
 One of the most important factors in getting a job in retail is experience. So, prepare to start in an  entry-level job  and take the time to learn every aspect of retail while you work your way up to your desired position. 
 4. You Don't Need To Have A College Degree 
 Many retail managers worked their way up to the position from the sales floor, but it's easier to land the job if you do have a degree. Most have a bachelor's in business administration and some even have an MBA. 
 For those without a degree, internal training and development programs will help to propel you forward. 
 5. There Are Many Specialties In Retail Management 
 As you move up in your career, you may have the opportunity to specialize in an area that interests you, including: 
 
 Buying 
 Pricing 
 Merchandising 
 Marketing 
 Personnel 
 Customer service 
 Training 
 Operations 
 
 6. Moving Up Often Requires A Physical Move 
 As you grow in your career, you are typically promoted by moving to larger stores in larger markets, or to area or regional management. Due to the nature of retail, these positions are rarely in the same city. 
 7. It's A Numbers Game 
 Success in retail is measured purely by sales and profit. Your job will be to improve commercial performance by meeting customer demand, increasing product turnover, and maximizing profitability. Although there are other considerations, compensation is highly dependent on these types of measures. 
 8. Customer Service Is Paramount 
 As the saying goes, "the customer is always right." Knowing that sentiment, retail managers are often presented with the most challenging situations and must exercise the utmost care when dealing with customers. 
 In today's " social media " driven society, mistreating a customer is the fastest way to destroy what was once a good reputation. 
 9. It's Not A 9 to 5 Job 
 Stores are meant to serve the public, a public that often works from nine to five and thus have to shop in the evenings or weekends. Therefore, retail managers are often required to  work non-traditional hours  to maximize their effectiveness. 
 10. Don't Burn Bridges 
 Especially when in the same local or regional market, retail is a small world. Everyone knows each other and the bridge you burned yesterday at one company may be the one you have to cross before you can get your next job. 
 Retail management isn't for everyone. But for the right person, it can be a great career path with lots of opportunities to achieve success.
