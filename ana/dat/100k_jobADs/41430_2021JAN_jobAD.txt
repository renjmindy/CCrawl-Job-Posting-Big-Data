 CROPSS ‚Äì Inspiring biology students to consider careers in crop protection 
 
 A couple of years ago, the BBSRC decided to scrap one of their most successful and inclusive PhD training awards, the  iCASE . In their own words,  BBSRC will no longer operate an annual competition for industrial CASE (iCASE) studentships, instead allocating the majority of these studentships to the BBSRC Doctoral Training Partnerships (DTP) for awarding alongside their standard studentships.  **** At one fell stroke the BBSRC reduced the diversity of their PhD portfolio by a significant amount and also dealt a huge blow to those of us working in crop protection, at a time when food security and the need to feed the world is of paramount importance. Later that year the BBSRC, possibly in response to those of us who kicked up a public fuss about the loss of the iCASE scheme came up with a very  inadequately funded scheme called STARS  aimed at getting undergraduates interested in some of the vulnerable skill sets that the BBSRC by their actions had made even more vulnerable. Despite the paltry amount of money available I felt that I had to apply, if only because having complained about lack of funding it would show lack of commitment to the cause üôÇ I duly applied putting forward an application to run a one week crop protection summer school for fifteen students a year for three years. I was successful and last week we ran our first CROPSS Summer School here at Harper Adams University. We particularly targeted first and second year undergraduates doing biology and ecology courses at other universities with little or no agricultural content in their degrees. Our participants came from the universities of Bath, Birmingham, Bristol, Cambridge, Liverpool and Swansea, and apart from one student who came from a farming family, they had no previous experience of agriculture, let alone crop protection. 
 The Summer School started on Sunday afternoon, with an introduction from me about why crop protection was important and how  Integrated Pest Management is all about ecology , NOT spraying and eradication, something I have been banging on about for many years üôÇ This needs to be reiterated again and again and as loudly as possible. We then had an excellent dinner and I took them all to the bar where I cruelly subjected them to a Pub Quiz, all picture rounds. The first round was all about charismatic megafauna (almost all answered correctly), then dog breeds (about 75% correct), then common British wild flowers (about 60% correct), common British trees (40% correct), common British insects (30% correct), I think you can see where I am going with this üôÇ 
 The week was divided up between agronomy, entomology, nematology, plant pathology, weed science and spray technology, with a mixture of lectures, field work and laboratory work. In the evening we had guest speakers from the different crop protection sectors, from the agrichemical industry through to government, our last speaker being the Chief Plant Health Officer, Nicola Spence. The external speakers had been asked to explain how they had ended up in their current positions and to talk about careers in those areas. I was very impressed with the willingness of the students to engage with the speakers and the questions they asked were extremely discerning. 
 We were very lucky to be blessed with excellent weather and the Harper Adams University Catering Department came in for very high praise indeed üôÇ apparently our catering is much better than at the universities represented by our delegates. 
 As the old adage goes, a picture is worth a thousand words‚Ä¶..

 Simon Woods from the Engineering Department explaining the fine points of knap sack sprayers 
 
 Andy Cherrill extolling the joys of motorised suction sampling 
 
 Enjoying the bar with one of the guest speakers, Neal Ward 
 All in all, we all had a good time, and if you don‚Äôt believe me here are some of the responses from the student feedback 
 
 The students were great, enthusiastic, engaged and we really enjoyed the course and are very much looking forward to seeing a new CROPSS cohort next year. 
 Finally, for those of you interested, here is the timetable of the week:

 EntoSci16 ‚Äì a conference for future and budding entomologists 
 
 Some of you may be wondering how this World‚Äôs first came about. Well, it was all due to Twitter. After a lot of  nagging  encouragement from one of my PhD students, I finally joined  Twitter at the back-end of 2012 . Shortly afterwards I met another new Tweeter, @Minibeastmayhem ( Sally-Ann Spence in real life ) who approached me with an idea that she had tried to get off the ground for a several years ‚Äì an entomology conference for children. This sounded like a great idea to me and I was extremely surprised to hear that she had been told by various entomologists that it wouldn‚Äôt work. After a bit of ‚Äòto and fro‚Äô on Twitter we met up for a very nice Sunday lunch and hammered out a basic plan of action and a mission statement. 
 
 Sally-Ann had done a lot of the preliminary work in approaching potential presenters and over the next couple of months we came up with a few more. I then sounded out my University (Harper Adams) who were very keen on the idea and agreed to do the publicity and the catering. We then began approaching a number of organisations for financial support and/or for stuff to put in the conference goodie bags. Surprisingly, some organisations that claim to support invertebrates and are keen on education, such as the RSPB and London Zoo, judging by their response, obviously didn‚Äôt even read our letters or only pay lip-service to the majority of the animal kingdom as they were singularly unhelpful. Undeterred by these setbacks, we persevered, and with very generous support from the  Royal Entomological Society  , both financial and in the person of their Director of Outreach, Luke Tilley, were able to put together a very exciting package of events and presenters. And very importantly, because of the generosity of our sponsors, all free for the delegates. The big day, April 13th 2016, arrived and we were as ready as we would ever be. Almost 300 students and their accompanying adults (science teachers, careers teachers and some parents) turned up on the day, and to think that at one stage we were worried that no-one would be interested üôÇ 
 The delegates were all issued with colour-coded conference lanyards, and with the enthusiastic help of MSc and BSc students acting as guides, were then   
 
 started on the action-packed, and hopefully enthralling and stimulating conference circuit. 
 
 George McGavin  (our Patron) and  Erica McAlister  from the Natural History Museum (London) got the conference off to a great start with two very entertaining plenary talks about the wonders of entomology and flies respectively. After that it was on to the zones. 
 Graham & Janice Smith  with the help of  Tim Cockerill , were kept very busy with their Bugs and Beetles room,  Steffan Gates (the Gastronaut)  gave a dazzling and interactive display of entomophagy,  Amoret Whitaker  from the University of Winchester introduced the students to forensic entomology which included them processing a ‚Äòmaggot-infested crime scene‚Äô, and current and past MSc Entomology students (Soap Box Scientists), the Field Studies Council, RHS Wisley, and other exhibitors provided a very interactive and informative session in Zone 5. In the main lecture theatre,  Max Barclay , Erica McAlister, George McGavin,  Andy Salisbury ,  Darren Mann  and  Richard Comont  were subjected to a barrage of questions ranging from how much they earned, to their favourite insects, their most dangerous insect encounter, some much easier to answer than others. 
 The day was especially long for some of us, as BBC Breakfast came and did some live filming, which meant that the organisers, presenters and some hastily drafted in students had to put in an appearance at 0645. I think that they felt it was worth the effort though, if only to be able to say that they had been on TV. All in all, the day was a real buzz. Of course the real stars were the insects and other invertebrates which managed to generate real enthusiasm among the delegates and their accompanying teachers. It was wonderful to see how many of the students responded so favourably to the insects, many of whom, at first, were reluctant to get close-up and personal with them. Seeing so many young people ‚Äúoohing and aahing‚Äù rather than‚Äù yukking and gagging‚Äù really made my day. I really, truly believe, that we will be seeing many of the delegates becoming professional entomologists. 
 I leave you with a few images to give you the flavour of the day.  For more professional images this link should keep you happy . 
 
 Early morning preparation, coffee was very much needed 
 
 And we're off to a great start 
 
 and it just kept getting better 
 
 and better 
 
 Some of the team, Luke Tilley, Sally-Ann Spence, Graham Smith, Tim Cockerill, George McGavin and me. 
 
 A really huge thank you to Laura Coulthard and Helen Foster, from the Harper Adams Marketing and Communications Department, who put their hearts and souls into making sure that the event ran smoothly. We couldn‚Äôt have done it without them. 
 And who knows, perhaps we will do it all again next year üôÇ
