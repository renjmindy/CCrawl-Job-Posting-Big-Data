 Sales 
 Our sales people sell their passion for our product. 
 
 By living our culture of recognition and feedback, our team – both in the field and in our corporate office – partner with the world’s most admired companies to educate them on the importance of human applications, and how social recognition and continuous performance development improve performance and elevate culture. 
 Our team is full of driven, passionate individuals who thrive on sharing the message that you can drive business results through something as easy as  saying thank you. 
 Whether it’s becoming a member of our Inside Sales Team and joining us in our Framingham office, or working on our field team remotely – our sales team is the heart of our business. We help our prospective customers understand the ROI behind what we do. 
 If you’re a driven sales professional looking to join a company that is growing exponentially – check out our openings. We’re looking for the best.
