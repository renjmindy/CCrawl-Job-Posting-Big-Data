 Are you a proven Sales, Account Management and Commercial leader who has forged a career in the fast paced world of Automotive Engineering and Manufacturing? Can you lead a team of driven and motivated sales and commercial individuals across two UK sites and deliver not only a robust sales and KAM strategy but also strategically plan and execute a new business / account development plan to deliver tangible results and a robust pipeline to the organisation? 
 This leading global automotive engineering and manufacturing business has a long standing history of delivering across the low, medium and high volume OEM customer markets and has grown extensively in the past 3 years to become a premium supplier in their market place. They have a diverse and enviable customer base that is developing year on year and with significant group investment and a desire to expand, they now require the support of a proven and driven Head of Sales & Commercial to deliver this roadmap. 
 You will report directly to the UK Managing Director and will be a key member of the Senior Leadership Team and will lead and develop a team of 6 initially with a strategy to grow and grow the team in line with the growth of the business. You will be responsible for leading and mentoring the key account and new business specialists and implementing a robust process of measurement and evaluation to maximise the return from the team and its input to the overall business. You will create and deliver the sales strategy for the team and be responsible for delivering the required growth and profit across the entire UK customer region. 
 The Head of Sales and Commercial will be responsible to establish execution plans and define programs which support business development and increase market share within target Customers and market segments and then drive revenue and pricing for improved profitability. They will be highly visible within the customer base and the champion of strong commercial relationships across all areas both internally and externally. You will be the voice of the UK business to the wider commercial group function and will strive for best in class commercial results to assist in delivering the companies revenue targets for the UK. 
 This person will lead the development of presentations and action plans for potential new clients and prepare executive briefing on strategic decisions, customer meetings or opportunities and deploy and follow group global processes (i.e. quotation, growth tracking, monthly operating review updates, input into forecasting & reporting) and drive ownership within region. Travel across two sites in the Midlands as well as customer sites across the UK and group sites in Europe will be required as part of this role so flexibility on travel is essential. 
 The ideal individual for this outstanding opportunity will be a proven commercial / sales leader with a strong automotive background ideally within the first or second tier manufacturing base and will have had managed both sales P&L as well as the people required to deliver it. You will be hands on but in equal part a strategic thinker who can look at both the now and the future potential in the market place. Experience of working within a large, global muti-site operation and experience of reporting into a group function would be ideal as would previous customer and commercial knowledge of the Jaguar Land Rover group. 
 This is a true commercial leadership role with multi-customer and multi-site team responsibilities and offers outstanding career development potential as well as a very strong overall remuneration package for the right person.
