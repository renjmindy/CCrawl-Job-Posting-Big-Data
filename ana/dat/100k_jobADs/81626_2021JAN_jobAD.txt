 ðŸ‘¥  **A bit about us.  ** 
 Placed is a mobile-first recruitment platform built for Gen Z. Using intelligent profiling and algorithm-based matching, Placed reboots the online presence for employers and allows candidates to discover jobs in a brand new way. By breaking down boundaries between service industries, we encourage candidates to consider roles based on their transferable skills, through interactive discovery, up-skill and re-skill quizzes. 
 Our vision is to successfully disrupt the current recruitment process and exorbitant fee structures for placing junior to mid-level positions and become the leader in tech-based recruitment solutions in this sector. Our clients include major retailers, hospitality, logistics and care companies including O2, Iceland, Black Sheep Coffee, Cote Restaurants and Orchard Care. 
 In 2021, Placed is expanding fast. We are launching in various new cities across the UK and are looking to triple our current team size within the next 9-12 months. We are looking for someone who is extremely passionate and hungry about being part of a start-up and someone who is up for a challenge and not afraid to learn on the job. 
 **ðŸ“£ A bit about the role.  ** 
 We are looking for a Marketing Leader to head up our growth strategies across both B2B (employers) and B2C (job seekers), responsible for both sides of our marketplace and lead our marketing team. 
 
 Employers - lead generation, CRM automations, industry presence, content & PR. 
 Job seekers - increase app download and registration, optimise funnels to reduce CPA, increase engagement and activity, lead and oversee digital acquisition. 
 
 Your role will initially span different areas across the business and we're looking for someone who has experience and interest in a broader role as the company continues to grow. 
 ðŸ“š **  Responsibilities.** 
 
 Lead strategy and plans for execution 
 Manage a small team of marketers and continue to grow a wider marketing team 
 Define processes and work on predetermines targets maximising all opportunities to achieve best results
