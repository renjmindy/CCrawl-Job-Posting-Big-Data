 What is a Substitute Teacher? 
 Substitute Teachers replace regular teachers for a short period of time (e.g. a week or a month) or for the entire academic year. They make sure that the lesson plan is followed and the classroom is running smoothly in the absence of the regular teacher. 
 What does a Substitute Teacher do? 
 This is usually a role for entry-level teachers who are currently taking their first steps in teaching before they become full-time educators. In some cases, Substitute Teachers work for a few hours per day or week and replace regular teachers on a day-to-day basis depending on short-term or even last-minute needs (e.g. when a teacher calls in sick). 
 Sometimes, they replace teachers for a longer period of time, for example, when the regular teacher is on parental leave or sabbatical. In this case, Substitute Teachers work full-time with a fixed employment contract. 
 When advertising your Substitute Teacher positions, consider including the specifics in the job title to target the right candidates. If applicable, mention in a parenthesis the educational level (e.g. elementary school, high school, etc.), whether this is a full-time job and whether you need expertise in a specific field, such as English language, Math, etc. 
 What are the responsibilities of a Substitute Teacher? 
 Duties may differ depending on the school, the class level and the teacher's field of expertise, but they usually include: 
 
 Following the curriculum and lesson plan 
 Preparing educational materials 
 Grading classwork and homework
