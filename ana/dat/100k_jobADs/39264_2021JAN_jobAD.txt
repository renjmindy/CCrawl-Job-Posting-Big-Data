 Jobs Should be Interesting, Not Death-Inspiring 
 One thing that always bothers me, is that people read this quote to say that you should go have an "exotic" or "expensive" job. I often have people say that sometimes you just have to do the boring or depressing job because you need money. My answer is this-if the job isn't something cool, then make it more fun. Be a happy person, play jokes, ask interesting questions, change the environment to be more fun. Just because the work itself is dull, doesn't mean the job has to be. **DB 
 "People rarely succeed unless they have fun in what they are doing." 
 - Dale Carnegie

 Whatever you do, do it well 
 “If it falls to your lot to be a street sweeper, sweep streets like Michelangelo painted pictures, sweep streets like Beethoven composed music . . . Sweep streets like Shakespeare wrote poetry. Sweep streets so well that all the host of heaven and earth will have to pause and say: Here lived a great street sweeper who swept his job well.” 
 ** Martin Luther King Jr.

 Thousands of Dollars Training 
 "Recently, I was asked if I was going to fire an employee who made a mistake that cost the company $600,000. No, I replied, I just spent $600,000 training him. Why would I want somebody to hire his experience?"

 Our Role In Life 
 “It is not our part to master all the tides of the world, but to do what is in us for the succour of those years wherein we are set, uprooting the evil in the fields that we know, so that those who live after may have clean earth to till. What weather they shall have is not ours to rule.” 
 **J.R.R.Tolkein
