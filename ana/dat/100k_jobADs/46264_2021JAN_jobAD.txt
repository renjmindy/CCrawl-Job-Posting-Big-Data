  How To Get Through ‘The Cave’ To Your Dream Job  
 Ryan Niessen 
 August 03, 2016 
 Do you ever wake up on Sunday with a sense of dread... because you only have one more day to relax before returning to the job you loath, but have to do to survive? Do you fear taking the chance of changing it up and going for something better... because if you fail, you know that you'll be stuck in your current job for the foreseeable future? **RELATED : ** 3 Clues That Will Help You Find Your Dream Job  If so, then don’t worry… you’re not the only one. I've been there, and so have many others. The good news is that your dream job does exist, and I like to imagine it as waiting for you on the other side of a big, dark cave. This cave looks so huge and terrifying that you tell yourself it may take days, weeks, or even months to make it through… if you do at all. However, all you have to do is take the first step... and the next, and the next, and soon you'll become accustomed to the darkness of the cave. And before you know it, you see the light at the end, with the shining image of your dream job, even better than you imagined. (By the way - there’s a resource at the end of this article that will help make your trip as short possible) With a renewed sense of energy and excitement, you push through the last bit of your journey, and break through to the other side. You made it. And you have this powerful feeling that after conquering the seemingly insurmountable challenge of ‘the cave’, you're now equipped to tackle any new challenge that arises. 
 
 How To Get To Your Dream Job 
 Anything you set your mind to... you can achieve. You just have to decide what that is. Now, if you’re staring at your personal ‘cave’ right now, here are three keys to making your journey as fast and easy as possible: 
 1. Persistence 
 A mentor of mine once told me that the road to making your first million dollars is all about hitting the same nail on the head many, many times. You can bet that getting the job that you love - that aligns with your deepest strengths, values, and passions - will be found the same way. You’re probably not going to get it right the first time. In fact, you may choose the wrong tunnel in your personal ‘cave’ and find that it leads to a dead end. So, you backtrack, and continue down another direction. As long as you keep moving forward, you’re making progress, and each experience you have will give you more clarity on the next step. 
 2. A Mentor 
 You already have everything you need to conquer your cave, but a great mentor will help you find what you need faster, and make your journey far easier. Now, a mentor can come in many forms, including a book, friend, parent, teacher, coach, or seminar. I’ve had many different types of mentors in my life, and each has added value in a different way. Typically, the best mentor is someone who has already done what you’re trying to do, since they’ll be able to give you the inside scoop on what to watch out for, and the best route to take. The right person could save you years of frustration, so think about who you could reach out to for some help on your journey. 
 3. A Map 
 You're not the first person to face this challenge, and you won't be the last. By taking advantage of the wisdom earned by others and using their map to get through your ‘cave,' and you can cut some serious distance off your journey, and save some bumps and bruises along the way. I had a map on the journey to my dream job, and it was provided by a man who later became my good friend and business partner. His name is Andrew Hewitt, and he's the founder of the GameChangers 500, a select group of organizations dedicated to making a profit as well as a difference in the world, empowering their employees, and being environmentally conscious as they grow. His teachings showed me the way to my dream job, and now, together, we're sharing those same lessons with the world. We've put together a free online video where you learn 3 of his most valuable tips on  getting your dream job  with GameChanging company. The three biggest keys for getting through my ‘cave’ to my dream job were persisting, finding a mentor, and using a map, and I believe those keys will work well for you, too.
