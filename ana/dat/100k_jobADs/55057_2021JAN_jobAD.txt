 What's the best way to land a remote job? 
 BY LINE THAMAWAT 
 Are you new in remote working, or do you just need some inspiration for your job search? If you don’t want to compete with all the candidates who are applying for listed jobs, why don’t you send an unsolicited application? It’s actually quite easy, but you will have to do a bit of ground work for it. Luckily we are here to give you a recipe on how to land a remote job. 
 1. Write a list of companies which you'd love to work for. 
 2. Make a list about what you already know about your field of expertise, what you would like to learn, and if you have any special areas that you're more interested in than others. 
 3. Make a template ( I use Canva ) for an unsolicited application that lists who you are, what you want to do, and why a company should take a chance with you, even though you don't have a proven track record in the specialist area, which you want to break into. Your list from point 2 will help you. Use examples of your successes in previous employments. 
 4. Take your list of companies and customise an application for each of them based on your template. 
 5. Investigate LinkedIn for people who work at those companies, write to them, tell them that you're interested in their company, and would they mind telling you a bit about their experience with the company, how they came to be with it, what's the best thing about working there, and if they would recommend applying for a job there. Sometimes people are willing to share, explain, and might even tell you who to send your application to. Mention in your e-mail or cover letter that you were recommended to apply by this person. It triggers trust in the hiring manager. 
 6. Send your application. 
 May the odds be forever in your favour.
