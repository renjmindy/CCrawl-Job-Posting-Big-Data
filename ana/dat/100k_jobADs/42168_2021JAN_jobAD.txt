 The Queensland Resources Council (QRC) welcomes the Palaszczuk Government's decision to issue a mining lease for a mine near Dysart in central Queensland until 2039, which has the potential to create much needed construction jobs and 200 operational jobs for the life of the mine. 
 QRC Chief Executive Ian Macfarlane said Bengal Coal's plan is to develop a new underground coal mine in the Bowen Basin. 
 "Around 200 jobs could be created for the Dysart East underground coal mine which has a target to produce about 1.9 million tpy of prime hard coking coal," Macfarlane said.
