 At Pure Beauty we are massive Aloe Vera fans. 
 As well as being an excellent anti-inflammatory and fabulous moisturiser, it is also said to contain antioxidants that can help repair damaged skin and prevent free radicals from doing their undesirable work. Used to relieve sunburn, acne, irritated, and dry skin, some people also believe it helps to reduce the appearance of stretch marks, fine lines and wrinkles. 
 We did a little bit of a search of our products and today we are sharing the Aloe love with you. 
 Dermalogica Skin Smoothing Cream  is great if you want to maintain your skin's moisture balance while improving texture and tone. Deep-moisturising Lecithin nourishes your skin and extracts of Mallow, Cucumber and Arnica soothe and hydrate it so suppleness is restored. Aloe has been added to the mix to moisture your skin and help prevent the appearance of dehydration lines and promote healing – what’s not to like? 
 The  Jan Marini Transformation Face Cream  helps to rebuild and repair damaged cells so that your skin looks, and feels, youthful. Anti-Aging Peptides, Hyaluronic Acid, Antioxidants and Aloe Vera come together in this luxury product and from the very first time you use it, your skin will appear smoother and have a gorgeous silky softness we think you will love. 
 Aloe can be great to boost tired, dull skin and this is why it has been added to the  Dermalogica Skin Renewal Booster . A blend of hydroxy acids and natural humectants have been blended to help with cell renewal and promote healthier-looking skin. Suitable for drier or prematurely-ageing skin, the booster exfoliates away dead skin cells and together Aloe, Chamomile and Cornflower hydrate the skin while Vitamins A and C smooth skin, so it feels happy once again. 
 Shaving is a part of everyday grooming but it can cause skin irritation, so to prevent this, we suggest using the  Elemis Skin Soothe Shave Gel . This easy to use, effective gel has an active base of Aloe Vera and Witch Hazel, that have been scientifically blended with anti-inflammatory extracts of Arnica and Chamomile and cooling Menthol. Together this offers the perfect shaving solution for even the most sensitive skins, and with Marine Extracts and Jojoba Oil added for comfort, this is a bathroom cabinet must have. 
 We know some people think toners dry the skin out, but this could not be further from the truth with the  Dermalogica UltraCalming Mist .This cool, soothing toner offers thirsty, dry skin hydration as well as relieving inflammation and discomfort. Aloe has been added as a skin soothing agent and this works beautifully well with the antiseptic and disinfectant qualities of Lavender to ensure skin is soft and supple and ready for your day or night cream. It is also brilliant to keep skin hydrated on the beach and during long flights when moisture is lost and dehydration sets in. 
 If your body feels like it needs a little extra love, why not take the  Jan Marini Bioglycolic Resurfacing Body Scrub  into the shower with you? Highly concentrated glycolic acid with exfoliating particles have been expertly blended with Aloe, Chamomile and Rosemary Extracts that together leave you with glowing skin that is silky smooth to the touch. That rough skin and those troublesome areas on the back of your arms, knees and legs will be a thing of the past. While you will see immediate benefits from this beautifully scented product, there will be progressive improvement over time that we think you will love. 
 If you would like more details about aloe,or are interested in trying  samples  to see if they work for you,  get in touch  and we would love to help you get your best skin ever.

 Mother’s Day is a special day where we all get the chance to show our mums exactly what they mean to us. It’s a time when Mums deserve to be pampered, and buying them the gift of beauty is a great way to do that. We may be biased, but we think almost everything we stock would make an amazing gift for your Mum this Mother’s Day, but in the interest of narrowing it down a bit, here’s 5 of the best: 
 Elemis Treat Your Feet Foot Cream 
 If your Mum spends a lot of time on her feet, this foot cream would be the ideal present for her. It’s an intensely moisturising formula which melts into the feet, nourishing the skin and softening areas of hardness. It contains conditioning shea butter and jojoba oil and smells wonderful. It bears the Elemis promise, meaning your Mum knows that there’s no parabens, sodium laureth sulphate, DEA, mineral oil or artificial colours in her treat. 
 Decleor Iris Rejuvenating Night Balm 
 This night balm from Decleor is a product which will not only work hard to make your Mum’s skin feel amazing, but it will also give her an excuse to take five minutes to pamper herself each evening. It’s to work at night when the skin is most receptive and will soothe the skin, reduce fine lines and wrinkles and increase cell renewal. 
 Dermalogica AGE Smart Starter Kit 
 This gift set from Dermalogica is the perfect introduction for your Mum to the wonderful anti-ageing products that Dermalogica has to offer. It contains Dermalogica Skin Resurfacing Cleanser, Dermalogica Antioxidant HydraMist, Dermalogica Multivitamin Power Recovery Masque, Dermalogica Multivitamin Power Firm, Dermalogica Dynamic Skin Recovery SPF30, Dermalogica MAP-15 Regenerator, Dermalogica Renewal Lip Complex (sample), which means she’ll get a perfect overview of the products, allowing her to buy the full price versions for herself if she wants to. 
 Decleor 1000 Grains Body Exfoliator 
 This exfoliator from Decleor has a unique consistency, which starts as a gel, which then turns into an oil and then becomes an easy-to-rinse milk upon contact with water. It contains grapefruit oil and pearl sugar which combines to leave the skin feeling softer, smoother and refined. 
 Elemis Sweet Orchid Monoi Body Oil 
 Body oils are a great way to pamper yourself from head-to-toe and this one from Elemis has a fabulously indulgent fragrance. It’s rapidly absorbed providing superior moisturisation for dry, parched or mature skin and can even be used to condition the body, hair and nails.
