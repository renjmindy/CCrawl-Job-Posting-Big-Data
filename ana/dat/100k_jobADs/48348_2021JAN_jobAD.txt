 Hello, 
I am Angelo Muti, Italian, born in Milan. For 5 years I live in Romania as a volunteer to help my Baptist pastor, Baron Howerthon (South Carolina, USA). Here in Romania I volunteer and do not receive any compensation. My money is running out. I receive a pension from the Italian state since June 1, 2012. In the meantime I need a rush job. 
 Higher education, theological studies, studies bibbliche, do not smoke. I have a diploma in therapeutic massage, reflexology. So do the injections. I have a driving license. I like to cook. I know I organized a very healthy food for growing children. Really polite, honest, respectful and responsible. I love and help children and even the most insignificant men. 
 I have the time to improve my English and to continue my studies bibbliche. On Sunday, I would like to go to a Christian church, preferably a Baptist or Methodist. 
 Can you have references from my pastor and my brothers Battisti to Italy. 
God bless you greatly, I am counting on your cooperation. 
 Angelo Muti (italian) 
 Str. Campionilor nr. 4 305500 Lugoj (Timis) Romania
