 Obama False Claims Of "Creating" Over 5 Millions Jobs -- Exposed As Another Obama Lie 
 
 Although it should have used harsher language in its headline…., has apparently set its leftist bias aside long enough to take shots at an ad narrated by President Barack Obama which claims 5.2 million jobs created….. 
 (cut)  Obama’s Inflated Jobs Claim:  "In a new TV ad, President Obama makes an inflated claim to have added 5.2 million new jobs. The total added during his time in office is actually about 325,000. In the ad, the president says “over 5 million new jobs” while the figure “5.2 million” appears on screen. But that’s a doubly misleading figure. 
 Viewers would need to pay close attention to the on-screen graphic to know that the ad refers only to employment gains starting in March 2010, omitting the 4.3 million jobs that were lost in the first year of Obama’s term. 
 According to the most recent employment figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the economy has eked out a net gain of 325,000 jobs since January 2009, when Obama took office. " full story: Read more:  here 
 
 I have come to expect inflated fabrication from Obama and his obedient  Obamabots  in the "lame stream media". Basically, they've had one job for a number of decades which is: cover up for Democrats and lie about Republicans. Just as Mitt Romney put so well,  " … the press and I have different jobs. My job is to tell the American people my plans for the country, the press' job is to make sure no one hears about it."  Said accurately with humor and satire. 
 I have little doubt the Barack regime assumed they could get away with the lie, that the terrorist attack which killed four Americans in Libya was  due to a phony video story.  That's due to the fact that our corrupt liberal media is most dutiful to ignore lies from Democrats (as this story is still not reported in the New York Times!). And thus, Barack confidently called for a "media check" in the last debate, knowing that when his lies or 'misspeaks' , were exposed (and they were), the media would have no obligation to report the 'revised version' of his facts. He was confident his lies against Romney would go  unreported by the majority of the so called news media. They have. 
 Obama hasn't "created" in 5 million jobs. It was just a number pulled out of thin air. Just as his blatant lies and personal attacks on Mitt Romney go ignored because they meet the agenda of the Leftist American press. 
 I know politics can be ugly. I knew this election would be particularly ugly. Gov. Romney is a moral, ethical and successful family man by all accounts. Something not only frustrating, but infuriating to Liberals, since they have so few of that caliber on their side of the political isle. Maybe they should try cleaning their own house before making jihad on the moral, ethical and successful of the nation. But I somehow, don't see that happening.

 The first year a president is in office, the budget and the policies of the previous president are still running the country. It isn't until the second year in office that the new president submits his first budget and then it must be approved by both houses of Congress. In fact, studies show that the first term of a president is when he started to implement new policy and it takes years for those policies to have an impact on the country. 
 To blame Obama for job losses starting on his first day in office, is not correct. The only financial disaster that comes close to the Great Recession of 2007 was the Great Depression lasted for a decade (1929 - 1939). 
 If we use your logic, then we have to blame Herbert Hoover for the Great Depression because Hoover was President from 1929 - 1933 and Hoover was a Republican but truth be told, it was not Hoover's fault because he inherited the financial environment of the nation from either Calvin Coolidge (1923 - 1929), also a Republican, or from Warren G. Harding (1921-1923), another Republican, who did not live to find out how the public would react to the scandals of his administration. In August of 1923, he died in San Francisco of a heart attack. 
 The White House bio on Coolidge says, "The political genius of President Coolidge, Walter Lippmann pointed out in 1926, was his talent for effectively doing nothing: "This active inactivity suits the mood and certain of the needs of the country admirably. It suits all the business interests which want to be let alone…. And it suits all those who have become convinced that government in this country has become dangerously complicated and top-heavy…." 
 Although the Great Depression started in 1929, your logic would blame FDR, a Democrat, since the highest level of unemployment at almost 25% hit during his first year in office as President of the US. You see, under Hoover, unemployment continued to climb. In 1929, when he took office, it was less than 5%. By the end of 1930 it was closing in on 10%. By 1931, it was passing 15% and by 1932, it had climbed higher than 20%. 
 However, your logic would blame FDR for the 25% unemployment that marked 1933 and you would probably not mention that under FDR, unemployment started to drop every year until 1938 when it jumped again for one year and then started to improve again. 
 But with Obama after the largest financial disaster in Global history since The Great Depression of 1929 - 1939, we see unemployment in the United States only reach a high of 10.1% (not the 25% of 1933) on October 31, 2009 and never crack ten percent again. Instead, unemployment holds and then starts to steadily improve until we reach September 2012's 7.8%. We do not see the same trend that took place Herbert Hoover where unemployment was out of control climbing a mountain. In fact, during the Great Depression, we would not see the country return to the unemployment rate of below 5% until 1942 after the start of World War II. It took the country thirteen years to recover from The Great Depression, and you condemn President Obama because he didn't achieve that in less than four years? No president could have succeeded in that time span.

 Long retort that I feel would be a waste, so I won't -- but Roosevelt extended the U.S. depression into the "Great Depression" (by his socialist policies) when the majority of the world was coming out of it. Reagan "inherited" a horrible economy and recessions from the failed Carter admin. and turned it around in a year. The polices he put in place, lasted through the lazy Clinton years, which ole Billy still wants to take credit for. 
Unemployment is hovering around 11%- 15%… the economy is dragging and Obama's spending is unspeakable. He's a failed man and failed president. He'll be gone Jan. 2013. He should already have been impeached for High Crimes, but unfortunately we have too many gutless Republicans. His lying about the terrorist attack in Libya, doing nothing to save their lives - it's beyond belief…. unless you KNOW who and what his small man is.

 Ptove that FDR's socialist policies dragged on The Great Depression. You argue with opinions driven by emotion with no facts to support your opinions.

 There is no evidence that any country has gone bankrupt due to socialist policies. I could provide an in depth answer with links and facts but it appears that you have limited the length of comments since my first one. For that reason, I will continue my answer to your emotional rant from one of my Blogs.

 I found a list of ten countries that went bankrupt and could not find any on the list that failed due to socialist policies. 
 1. Argentina in 2001: caused by a run on its banks followed by a collapse of the country's national currency. 
 2. Iceland in 2008: a casuality of the American made global financia crisis of 2007. The value of Iceland's currecny dropped so low that it wasn't worth enough to pay for important on which the country is heavily dependent. 
 3. Germany in 1920 and 1945 as a result of losing World War I and World War II. War is expensive! 
 4. Great Britian in 1945 as a result of the cost of fighting World War II. So ravaged was the British economy following the war that almost all national resources were dedicated to paying war debts for five full years after its completion. In fact, the US has spent more than $40 Trillion on defense since the end of World War II but less than $10 Trillion on welfare programs. 
 For the rest of the ten, I suggest visiting:  http://www.billshrink.com/blog/6799/10-governments-that-went-bankrupt/ 
 Such stories are sobering reminders that national bankruptcy is very much real, and has happened repeatedly throughout history to nations that fail to take proper precautions. 
 Spain went bankrupt seven times in the 19th century alone before there was such a thing as socialism. In addition, France has became insolvent eight times between 1500 and 1800. Ecuador has gone bankrupt six times since 1830.

 China is a communist country that has adapted capitalist economic principles when the Politburo figured out they couldn't survive economically under a communist system. Adapting capitalistic principles doesn't make communism a "success story", or China a relevant example. Nice try.

 Indeed it is. The government officials at the top finally realized how rich they could be by delving into the 'free market' that they control. The people aren't allow to prospect as they could. Socialism is a failure for people and yet those who love dictators, still embrace the system. Pathetic.

 Since socialism is such a terrific success, as proved by the fallen USSR, Cuba … Greece, Italy, etc. I see no need for discussion. 
Your problem is that this nation has a Constitution, the Law of the land, which should be respected and followed. It was intentionally designed with intent of leaving kings, rulers and dictators behind -- as long as it was respected. We thus established the greatest, 'exceptional' country in the world (offering maximum freedom to individuals), which is being destroyed by mini- men, hell bent on BIG government controlling our lives -- the whole reason we left GB. I would respectfully suggest to anyone loving Socialism to move to a country which propagates that delightful economic system and life style …. and leave this one alone. 
And no I haven't changed comment section. But it might be given some consideration.
