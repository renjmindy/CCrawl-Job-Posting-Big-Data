 POEA Internet Job Scams 
 Posted on  July 12, 2009  by  caregiver 
 The POEA or Philippine Overseas Employment Administration has warned anew against internet job scams being circulated on the web. Several employment opportunities allegedly being offered by local and international agencies had already victimized Filipino workers, according to the reports POEA earlier received. The public is asked to be aware of internet job scams by Reserve Petroleum Nederland BV, Western Nursing and Day Care Services Limited, and First Global Manpower. 
 The POEA advisory listed Reserve Petroleum Nederland BV as claiming to have a website, which posts fake offers for jobs in dredging and marine projects in Europe. This company also asks applicants to pay fees for visa or work and residence permit and additional fees to cover registration of documents. 
 Western Nursing & Day Care Services Ltd., on the other hand, targets OFWs in the Middle East with its website at wns.ltd.tripod.com/index.html. This fake agency offers caregiving jobs in Canada and asks applicants to pay a visa fee and medical insurance. 
 FirstGlobal Manpower likewise uses free e-mail and website hosting services. It has its website address at firstglobal.manpowerrecruitment@yahoo.fr that claims to offer jobs to OFWs as fish packers, garden workers and office cleaners in Ecuador, USA, Canada and Turkey. 
 POEA Administrator Rosalinda Baldoz advised would-be OFWs who would want to be deployed abroad to check on the POEA list of accredited recruitment agencies to ensure the veracity and truth of its activities. 
 Filipino workers in the Philippines are advised to report illegal recruitment and other internet job scams at the Legal Assistance Division, Anti-Illegal Recruitment Branch, 4th Floor, POEA Building or the nearest POEA and Department of Labor and Employment regional office.
