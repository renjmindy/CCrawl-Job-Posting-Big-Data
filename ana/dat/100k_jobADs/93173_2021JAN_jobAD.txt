Many individuals look at content creation in terms of videos, fashion, music, and so much more as a career option. Most importantly, YouTube as a career option. So let us get a look at the rising star of Youtube Bhuvan Bam. 
 Bhuvan Bam Net worth in rupees 2020: 
 While many people were unaware of YouTube as a career option, Bhuvan changed the game. He earns money through his YouTube channel “BB ki Vines,” through which he rose to popularity. It is said that the channel was starred accidentally when he was checking his phone’s front camera. His channel has around 18.7 million subscribers, and his net worth is approximately 2.9 million, which is 21 crore INR. Bhuvan, apart from the channel, is also a singer and a songwriter.
