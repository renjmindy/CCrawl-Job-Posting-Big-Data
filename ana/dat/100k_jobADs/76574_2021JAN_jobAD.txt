 Social Media and the Job Hunt 
 Posted on  February 23, 2015  by   remotehr 
 Last week, I presented a lecture on Social Media in the Workplace to students at  The University of Sunderland  and was spoilt for choice when it came to finding cases to use as examples. 
 Social Media in the workplace is a hot topic for HR specialists and is something I deal with a lot. 
 Technological developments have changed the way people conduct their personal lives and it often seems that we live our lives through our social media profiles. With more people sharing more and more personal information online, it is important we think about how people see us online - especially when we look for a new job. 
 The professional networking site  LinkedIn  has 200 million users,  Facebook  has one billion users,  Twitter  and Google+ have 500 million users and Instagram has 200 million users. 
 What I find scary is that, despite the fact that social media is quite clearly hear to stay, its role in the hiring process remains a little sketchy for both candidates and recruiters. 
 A recent survey of 2000 UK workers and employers found that 46% were unsure as to whether or not their presence on social media would have a negative impact on future opportunities. This figure suggests that employees may not be confident with what content is appropriate to share on social media, or what prospective employers might be judging them on. 
 Employers have been embracing social media for some time now. And, despite the fact that social networks have grown to be one of the most powerful recruiting tools available, 88% of respondents said their wouldn’t be put off a candidate if they had no social media presence while just 4% said that it was a ‘deal breaker’. Of those that would be dissuaded, three-fifths admitted that they felt worried that someone without social media had something to hide. 
 Interestingly, 75% of employees said that they felt comfortable with future employers looking at their social media profiles while only 5% saying that it was ‘a big concern’. 
 But it isn’t just the employers turning to social media for more information. 
 More than a quarter of candidates said that they had Googled staff members at an organisation that they were applying to with 14% having looked at employee profiles on LinkedIn. 
 The survey also found that a third of job hunters fail to keep their LinkedIn profiles up to date when applying for new roles, with just two out of 10 remembering to keep their CV’s and LinkedIn profiles in line with one another. 
 Whether we like it or not, the use of social media in the recruitment process happens so why not use it to your own advantage? 
 
 Ensure your LinkedIn profile matches your CV. 
 Check your privacy settings to make sure you know what you are sharing, and with who. 
 Delete any inappropriate comments or photographs which may show you in a bad light.
