 Join as the first Sales Development Representative who finds and connects with leads, to move them through the pipline. We hire remote üåê 
 
 At Daily we build video APIs that let a developer add video chat to any site or app ‚Äî in minutes, on a global infrastructure, with features for every use case. Live video has leapt into mainstream use, and this is just its first phase of growth. 
 Our APIs are designed for this key shift, where video is part of how we live and work, and where developers build with services and rely on platforms ‚Äî like Shopify, Stripe, and Daily ‚Äî to launch, monetize and scale. With 10x growth this year, we serve teams like startups, high-growth YC teams and public companies in verticals such as healthcare, automotive and real estate. 
 We're hiring our first Sales Development Representative. This is an opportunity to join an early-stage team that's backed by stellar investors, going after a big market. (Our last publicly announced round was a $4.6mm seed.) We care deeply about what we build, and believe diversity and kindness are part of excellence. 
 If you share these values, and thrive on delivering results and growth, please read on! 
 SDR at Daily 
 Your goal, as Sales Development Representative, is to drive our demand engine. In our rapid growth we've identified key trends in customer interest. You'll get excited understanding our customer profile, engaging leads, and moving them through the funnel. 
 Our team culture is anchored in product, so we're looking for someone who's fired up about sales and also appreciates a thoughtful culture. Finally, early stage DNA is key. You're the first sales hire. You have to figure things out and come up with processes that make sense to our stage and trajectory. We are not a fit if you need things set up for you or, on the other hand, if you dislike a collaborative culture.

 Design, implement and manage touchpoints (cold-calls, emails, social, etc) in the demand gen lifecycle 
 Move all leads through the funnel, and figure out what that funnel looks like for an early-stage team like ours 
 Develop relationships with prospect to understand their needs, qualify them, and hand-off 
 Understand a lead's needs, and convey product information and value to them 
 Follow-up with leads who didn't convert despite interest, learn why, and share that information 
 Work with cofounders to establish lead and list SLAs and report on them weekly 
 Maintain a CRM 
 Provide feedback to marketing on messaging 
 
 What we look for: 
 Excellence requires diversity. We strongly encourage candidates from underrepresented backgrounds in technology to apply. 
 
 Kind people who excel 
 Track record of SDR results (3+ years)
