 New Article: Benjamin, Negotiating Job Quality in Contracted-Out Services 
 Posted on  February 16, 2016  by   Aryeh 
 Benjamin, Orly. "Negotiating Job Quality in Contracted-Out Services: An Israeli Institutional Ethnography." In  The Post-Fordist Sexual Contract: Working and Living in Contingency  (ed. Lisa Adkins and Maryanne Dever; Basingstoke and New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2016): 149-69. 
 
 Extract 
 I forward an analysis of the process of preparing contracts themselves prior to service operation, and the negotiations between various public sector administrators that shape employees' job quality. I make use of Dorothy Smith's (2005) methodology of institutional ethnography for the purpose of understanding how job quality is shaped for both certified and uncertified employees in the social services commissioned by the Israeli Welfare, Education, and Health ministries.
