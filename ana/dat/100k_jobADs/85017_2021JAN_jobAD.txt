 Orientation 
 Attitude is Everything 
 We're not just a "staffing agency"; we're HR professionals. Every day, WorkSource serves two distinct types of "customers"; we serve clients, and we serve employees. (and understand clearly that we need both!) As a result, the "quality" of each matters to us. We take the time to get to know our clients and employees, and do things in a way the leads to success. Quality matters. Placing that belief front and center allows us to serve best. 
 WorkSource employs a variety of resources and strategies which allow us to quickly turn solid applicants, into solid employees.
