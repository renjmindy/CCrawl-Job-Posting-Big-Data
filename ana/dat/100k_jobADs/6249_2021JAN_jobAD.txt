 Started my new job today at  PivotPoint Solutions . I'm the first one here, most of the lights are still off, and I don't have a login to my work computer. That's par for first day on the job. Most of my co-workers are on  LinkedIn  if you want to see who else works for the company. At least I have an Internet connection that works. I'll see how long I can be entertained by Dilbert cartoons and YouTube videos. 
On a totally unrelated note, a new, and often comical YouTube fad is videotaping (or cameraphoning) cops who take their job way too seriously. Example:  http://youtube.com/watch?v=9GgWrV8TcUc . This proves that the words "dude" and "man" can be considered assult and are punishable by an immediate headlock & wrestling to the ground.
