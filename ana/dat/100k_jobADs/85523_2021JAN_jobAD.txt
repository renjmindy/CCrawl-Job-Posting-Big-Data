 When Oliver Velasquez arrived for a job fair earlier this summer at the new Allentown hockey arena, he was shocked by the number of attendees. 
 "I didn't expect to see that many people; there must have been thousands," the 26-year-old Allentown resident said. "The line actually wrapped around the block a couple of times." 
 Velasquez waited in that line, and it paid off for him. He is now the PPL Center's new suites and catering manager, providing banquets for catered events and overseeing food in the arena's private suites.

 Syreeta Redcross of  Allentown  takes care of her five children on her wages at a local logistics company. 
 The pay is relatively low, so the 28-year-old often has to scrape to afford the basics — like diapers for her kids. She relies on subsidized day care to be able to hold down a job at all. 
 Redcross stopped by the PA CareerLink  Lehigh Valley  job fair on Wednesday looking for a better-paying job. 
 "It's very challenging," she said. "It's a struggle out there." 
 Redcross' struggles are far from unique, according to findings released this week by the  U.S. Census Bureau .
