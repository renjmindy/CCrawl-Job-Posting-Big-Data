 Product Review: Getting Relaxed with the Jobst Relax 
 
 This may be a new type of compression garment for you to try ..thanks for sharing this review based on your experience… it is certainly less bulky than other options 
 
 The Lymphie Life 
 Disclosure:  I received one free Jobst Relax to review on The Lymphie Life. Although this post is sponsored, all opinions expressed here are my own honest impressions of the product! 
 When I first saw the Relax last autumn before it’s official launch, I thought it was totally different than anything I had seen before. After wearing it for a good couple months now, the initial impression of novelty has evolved into genuine appreciation, as the Relax has become the garment I never knew I needed. 
 This latest compression tech from Jobst is not quite a nighttime garment, and it’s not quite a daytime one, either: it’s more of a  lifestyle  garment. That’s what I love most about it, because it fits whatever need you may have for it. 
 The Product 
 Just one look at the Relax and you can tell it’s different from most custom garments out there because of its unique material.

 Lymphoedema Awareness 
 I am writing this blog to keep a record of my Lymph Node Transplant in the hope of inspiring and helping others. 
I wish to bring awareness to the issues of Lymphoedema so that people will better understand this very difficult and little understood health problem. We need more research and a brighter outlook for those with both Secondary and Primary Lymphoedema. 
Items in this blog are to only be used in conjunction with a medical diagnosis and with a treatment plan specific to your needs. Please check with your lymphoedems specialist if you are feeling unwell or unsure about treatment and care.. MLD should never be used if you have an infection..Please share this blog with your friends and family... Thanks
