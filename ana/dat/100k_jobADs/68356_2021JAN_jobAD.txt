 Hi, 
 Our FotoArtist photo app is based off of my 20-years of expertise in this space. I know what 
users love to do with their photos and how to build a creative community. My current business (20 yrs) is developing, selling and marketing photo effects plugins. 
 As you will see, all the groundwork has been done for Fotoartist over the last 18-months. 
 
 Great team dedicated to scaling this business worldwide 
 SEIS pre-approved 
 Offer proven best selling photo effects to a market hungry for innovation 
 Build a creative community around the App 
 Disrupt the market by offering photo printing/bespoke greeting cards

 We're now at the stage to need investors (or Crowd Funding). This is a  remote position  that requires someone who has skills in helping us find financing for the App. You receive equity and/or a percentage of the raise. 
 Thank you for your time, we look forward to hearing your ideas and making you a part of our team. 
Regards, 
Gavin Phillips
