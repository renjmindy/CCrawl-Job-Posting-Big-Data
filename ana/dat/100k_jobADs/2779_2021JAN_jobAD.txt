 About Routable 
 Routable is simplest way to send and receive business-to-business payments. 
 ✅ Send payments to vendors with just an email

 Benefits 
 🚀 Remote 
 
 We are a remote friendly culture! 
 Rather than restrict ourselves to only find talent in one city, we’d rather find the absolute best people regardless of where they live. One amazing benefit to our remote culture, is that it enables our team to enjoy traveling ✈️ more regularly since they can literally work from wherever! 
 
 🤠 Rendezvous 
 
 To help foster amazing relationships with our coworkers, we meet up quarterly as a whole team in some pretty awesome cities! 
 In the past we’ve met up in San Diego, Seattle, and Austin. 
 We’d rather invest money into memorable team events rather than expensive offices. 
 During our meet-up team time, we love to spend time learning a new skill together, and solving problems. 
 Most recently this has taken on the form of a bread-making class and defeating an Escape Room. Yeah.. We love to compete together as a team. 
 
 🧘‍♀️Recharge 
 
 We encourage our team to relax and recharge each weekend. 
 We’ve all been a part of startups before, and know how important it is to take care of yourself so that you can consistently contribute your best. 
 Quality downtime enables quality uptime. 
 Yes, we do have super-humans on the team, but even they need their R&R.
