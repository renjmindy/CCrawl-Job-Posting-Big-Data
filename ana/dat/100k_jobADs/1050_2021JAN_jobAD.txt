 Sweet Baby Jason! it's a Full-time job 
 Nothing would make your mom happier than bragging to the girls that her kid got a job as a Group Creative Director at Zillow Group in Seattle, WA, USA. They'd all be very impressed with how brilliant and incredibly ambitious you are. 
 About 
 About the team 
Zillow is building a world-class creative organization that drives the vision and development of compelling Brand, B2C and B2B communications for all customer touchpoints in the U.S. As a brand, Zillow brought transparency to the real estate market 10+ years ago by allowing buyers and sellers to see the value of every home—and we are reinventing the industry again. This team will be responsible for bringing delightful experiences to our customers and partners through understanding the business and delivering high-level compelling creative. If your passion is to make great work for a beloved brand that moves people, we’d love to talk with you! 
 About the role 
 We are seeking a Group Creative Director to help establish and build the Zillow partner and B2B brands across all touch points. This role is on the creative team, which is part of the larger marketing organization who are on a mission to create beautiful, seamless and inspiring experiences for our customers and partners. The GCD will lead projects from concept to delivery, leading a group of creatives – both design and copy – collaborating closely with producers, and working with internal partners, to bring their ideas to life. This person should feel excited and confident about mentoring and developing their team, helping them mold and pitch new ideas, and be forward-thinking about growing the brand and how we communicate with our customers. We’re passionate about helping people unlock their next chapter, and we want someone that will help us define what that looks like for the future of Zillow. 
 This position works closely with the VP Creative, ACDs, Art Directors, Copywriters, and Producers to imagine and produce engaging, original and on-brand solutions for our interactive media, collateral, advertising, social campaigns and unique digital experiences.
