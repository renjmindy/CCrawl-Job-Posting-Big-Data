 Please help me identify neuroscientists hired as tenure-track assistant profs in the 2018-19 faculty job season

 For the past two years, I tried to crowd-source a complete list of everyone who got hired into a neuroscience faculty job over the previous year. I think the list has almost everyone who was hired in the US… let’s see if we can do better this year? 
 I posted an analysis of some of the results  here  – one of the key “surprises” was that no, you don’t actually need a Cell/Nature/Science paper to get a faculty job. 
 If you know who was hired to fill one or more of the listed N. American assistant professor positions in neuroscience or an allied field, please email me with this information (neurorumblr@gmail.com). 
 To quote the requirements: 
 
 I only want information that’s been made publicly available, for instance via an official announcement on a departmental website, or by someone tweeting something like “I’ve accepted a TT job at Some College, I start Aug. 1!” If you want to pass on the information that you yourself have been hired into a faculty position, that’s fine too. All you’re doing is saving me from googling publicly-available information myself to figure out who was hired for which positions. Please do not contact me to pass on confidential information, in particular confidential information about hiring that has not yet been totally finalized. 
 Please do not contact me with nth-hand “information” you heard through the grapevine. Not even if you’re confident it’s reliable. 
 I’m interested in positions at all institutions of higher education, not just research universities. Even if the position is a pure teaching position with no research duties.
