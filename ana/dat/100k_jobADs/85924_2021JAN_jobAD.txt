 How to create your own income IF you can't find the JOB you WANT in 2011: MY BUSINESS MAKEOVER TAKEOVERS! Part One 
 Posted on  February 6, 2011  by  Ressurrection 
 Yesterday, I had an alarming conversation with someone that told me it was my fault that I couldn't find a job. This was a completely different attitude from a few days ago when she had me in tears with her own personal testimony of her and her six children on her back. I have done my resume 100 different times (clear exaggeration), and have applied for everything from Grocery Store Clerk to Director of Marketing or Director of Communications. 
 Today, my bestfriend who is more of a boyfriend-brother-father-friend, than anyone ever has been in my entire life had major surgery at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland. 
 For the past two weeks, the place that I work at as an "Independant Contractor" has had no clients for me to massage, not one. She, the owner called me this morning. She called and asked me to be available for an 11:00am massage at about 9:30am. I was six miles from the Bethesda hospital, and standing in front of his wife awaiting instructions on food. 
 I have made myself available for the past six weeks for the hours of 10am-2pm, Monday-Friday for massage; 25 hours per week with only between 1-5 hours filled of those hours per week for massage work. 
 Every business owner I have ever met that offers massage, i.e, spa, tanning salon, etc… wants the massage therapist to be in the location (just in case) someone calls for a massage. Sometimes they want you to drum up business by offering chair massage (which is no real indication of a table massage by the way.) 
 After I shared the emergency, she said she was taking me off of the schedule for massage hours I had volunteered to work the night before for this coming Wednesday and Friday. She followed that she would call me back to determine if I could still work for her. 
 Thank you for reading.

 I Had A Dream And It Came True! (Wedding) 
 
 
 Ressurrection 's Wedding on the National Mall - OPEN INVITATION August 28, 2013 
 The President is expected to attend the festivities at the Martin Luther King Jr. and/or Lincoln Memorials to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the March on Washington and the I Have A Dream speech. One couple in the Nation’s Capital will commemorate this speech with their wedding ceremony scheduled at the Jefferson Memorial at 2pm on August 28th, 2013. During this monumental wedding ceremony the couple will share their vows and incorporate their Martin Luther King Jr. inspired theme, “I Had A Dream And It Came True.” An earthquake shook the Washington DC Area on August 23rd, 2011, and a Tornado followed that week. But the sun came out on August 28th, 2011, the 48th anniversary of the, "I have a dream" speech. After Graves returned from the opening day of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial her Groom made his move, they talked over a game of chess, in which she won the game and his heart. Graves had witnessed a reenactment of Martin Luther King Jr. speaking on that day. She believed it to be a tape recording until she saw a gentlemen from California drawing a crowd. With such a rich beginning Graves and Groom intend to share their nuptials as a public testament of their strength, faith and love. They welcome those who celebrate love to join them on the lawn of the Jefferson Memorial, at 2pm on August 28, 2013 the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.’s speech saying, “I Had A Dream And It Came True.”
