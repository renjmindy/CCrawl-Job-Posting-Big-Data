 I am third year nursing student from Philippines and have related learning experiences in various aspects of nursing care in hospitals and nursing homes during the course of our studies. I enjoy taking care of elderly individuals because I also learn a lot from them. They give me different perspectives in life so that I learn to be responsible, dedicated and hardworking person. I would be very much willing to prove my worth and hope you will give me a chance.
