 I am a graduate of nursing however i have not passed the nursing licensure exam. Due to financial demands, I need to look for a job that could help support my family. 
 I have experienced taking care of my sister's children when they were still young, and worth mentioned experienced was when I took care of my father when he suffered from stroke and attending him all the assistance he needed. 
 I'm interested to apply in your company and I hope to hear back from you soon.

 Greetings to all; I am Susana D. Ingalla, 50 years old. physically fit and I would like to inquire about this job.. Caregiving would not be a difficult work for me, because i had experienced for a longtime of taking care of my mother in law when she was bedridden patient. I can be a nanny also, because, I've never been experienced a helper to take care of my 5 kids.. ages 23,16,14,12,and10 years old now. They are grownup with good attitude and brilliant with all my effort.. This is my first time to inquire work abroad and I'm willing to work apart from my family for their better future. My husband lost his job only this Dec.2010 and we have no source of income since then, my kids are all in school. Can you help me please.. Thanks and more power to your company…
