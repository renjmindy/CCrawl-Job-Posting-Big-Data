 Weekend Funny Challenge

 Copyright by  Incidental Comics 
 I’ll admit, I’ve considered at some point I’ve wanted to be a teacher, doctor, astronomer, astronaut, athlete, chef, painter, director and costume designer , and I’m not even out of school yet! I’ve settled (at the moment) to pursue something in writing. 
 If you could quit your jog or finish school today, what would you do for the rest of your life (kudos to you if you’re already doing it)? Any of these professions sound appealing?
