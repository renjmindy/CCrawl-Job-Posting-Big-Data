 Web Developer LOCALPERMANENT 
 Job Description 
 We are currently looking to add a talented web developer to our local team. The most important thing for us is to produce great work that makes a real difference and we’d like you to help. 
 The new team member would be actively involved in the development of new projects as well as helping to maintain existing websites and applications, that range from small CMS brochure sites to extensive and bespoke website applications. 
 The majority of our projects are built with Craft CMS and often employ Vue.js and JQuery on the front-end. 
 Extensive knowledge of Craft CMS is not a must, but a willingness to learn and grow your skill set is. 
 What you can expect 
 You will be working closely with the rest of the team to craft and deliver complete digital solutions for our clients; right from the initial discovery and scoping phases, to the final delivery and launch of the project. 
 Your input will be incredibly valuable during the design phases of a project and you’ll be expected to work closely with the design team to ensure that a project transitions smoothly from final design to fully functioning website. 
 Each week you will be: 
 
 
 building new and working with existing Craft CMS websites 
 
 
 adding additional functionality to existing websites and applications 
 
 
 coding up designs of responsive websites 
 
 
 deploying code to multiple servers 
 
 
 and occasionally: 
 
 helping to develop internal processes and tools 
 
 We'd expect that you: 
 
 
 enjoy working collaboratively 
 
 
 have great conversation skills 
 
 
 are self-motivated and passionate about your work 
 
 
 have a good understanding of HTML5, CSS3, PHP and MySQL 
 
 
 have experience with task-runners like Gulp and Grunt 
 
 
 write clean, maintainable code that is standards compliant 
 
 
 have experience building complex responsive websites 
 
 
 have a sense of humour 
 
 
 It would be even better if you: 
 
 
 are comfortable working with Git 
 
 
 can code in plain JavaScript, without the use of JQuery or similar library 
 
 
 have used Vue.js 
 
 
 have an understanding of fundamental design patterns 
 
 
 are comfortable writing tests for your code 
 
 
 have some Systems Administration experience 
 
 
 have experience working with Laravel 
 
 
 How to Apply 
 Send an email to  [email protected]  with details of your experience, salary requirements, examples of your work and any relevant links (Github profile etc.). We’ll take a look and be in touch to discuss the next steps. 
 We’re looking forward to hearing from you!
