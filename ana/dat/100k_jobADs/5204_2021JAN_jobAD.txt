 Have you or a close friend been affected by the housing affordability crisis? Do you believe good design can not only transform a space but also positively impact a person's mental state? By and large millennial homeowners are priced out of urban centers and turnkey homes. With 80% of homes now older than 20 years old, the options for affordable housing are typically dated and underwhelming. With rising costs of new construction, the need for renovations has never been higher, but the process hasn't changed in decades. Skipp is collaborating with world class architects, designers and technologists to not only make the process of transforming a home easier and affordable, but also fun and inspiring. We are an early stage, VC-backed startup, using AI and the latest in spatial technology to simplify the renovation process and democratize access to elevated designs for the everyday homeowner. In just hours Skipp's technology can generate real-time pricing, architect grade documentation, visualizations, and material schedules. With this approach, homeowners can not only access world-class designs for their actual space immediately, but can also efficiently manage their budget and have all the documentation needed for a streamlined RFP and construction process.
