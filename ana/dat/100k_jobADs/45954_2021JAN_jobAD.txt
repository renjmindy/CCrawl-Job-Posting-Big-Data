 Is political changeling Rodney Glassman seeking another job? 
 Slickster Rodney Glassman attempting to promote himself as a middle-man bundler for Pres. Trump and hoping to be rewarded 
 Today is  Labor Day . Now celebrating all American workers, it was originally promoted by labor unions and signed into law June 28, 1894 by President Grover Cleveland. 
 Although perennial candidate Rodney Glassman wasn’t around in Cleveland’s era, he does have something in common with the former president: Both were Democrats. 
 Plagued by personal scandals, Cleveland never changed his affiliation, but Glassman, who has run and lost myriad elections, was a lifelong Democrat…  until  he magically recast himself as a “conservative” Republican during his recent 2020 campaign for Maricopa County Assessor. Glassman lost that primary race also, soundly trounced by incumbent Eddie Cook. 
 Two short years ago, in 2018, then Corporation Commission candidate  Glassman was featured  on the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union slate which endorsed only Democrats. His photo is adjacent to that of far left U.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva, (AZ CD-3) an illegal alien advocate, in whose D.C. office Glassman previously worked. 
 In 2012 when Democrat Glassman ran for the U.S. Senate from Arizona, he was  enthusiastically endorsed  by both Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the advocacy and political arm of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, and Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona. 
 Additionally, Rodney Glassman was a candidate for state chairman of the Arizona Democrat Party, hoping to guide the statewide strategy for  defeating  Republicans. This post was one in a long string of offices he sought and lost. 
 Rodney Glassman is desperate for a win. His intent is to buy his way into office…any office. 
 He’s unmistakably gearing up again, recently sending out bizarre emails soliciting money for President Trump. “Please join me in contributing to President Trump’s re-election campaign by completing the attached contribution form and mailing it to: Rodney Glassman, Trump Victory Fund," with his law firm’s address. Those who amass funds on behalf of presidential candidates are known as “  bundlers  ,” ***** often seeking cushy appointments for their efforts. The amounts on the form range from $1,000-$5,000 annually on the low end to $1,161,200 per couple annually. Glassman even offers this inducement: “If you’d like to meet for a coffee or lunch, I would be happy to connect personally for a visit and contribution hand-off.” He signs the email, "Thanks, in advance! Your Friend, Rodney." 
 Thanks…but no thanks Rodney. Most of us choose our friends more carefully. And we are perfectly capable of sending in our usually more modest donations to reelect President Trump on our own. 
 Disclosure of Campaign Bundlers  ***** 
 “…The public needs to be able to gauge for itself whether the people elevated to political appointments got there based on their merits or by virtue of their prowess as elite "bundlers." A study of President Obama's top-tier fundraisers in 2008 showed that 80% received "key administration posts" as defined by the White House.”

 Why would anyone giving a contribution to the Trump-Pence campaign feel the need to use a slippery, politically opportunistic, middle man like Glassman? Besides, Bundlers only deal with mega-donors to bolster their own standing.

 Glassman is toxic. Maricopa County Treasurer Royce Flora, a former movie stunt man, who called himself a “Servant Leader” learned the hard way what being a servant to Glassman netted him. He partnered with Glassman who was running for Assessor, and they both lost. Flora will be out of office in January replaced by Republican former state legislator, John Allen, who beat Flora by 14 points!

 The Bible addresses this very succinctly: "Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."

 And thanks to Russell Pearce foolishly backing Rodney (Remember Rodney ran in the Democrat U.S. Senate Primary against Randy Parraz in 2010, the man behind the phony recall), Pearce will be outta of a job come next year. Shame on Royce as well!

 So glad I didn’t vote for newly minted "conservative" Glassman or his willing toady Flora. They each got what they deserved. Also disappointed with Pearce. He signed onto a letter in support of Glassman that Flora sent out. I was disgusted when I saw both of their smiling faces trying to con the Republican PCs they sent the letters to.

 Glassman is “of counsel” at the firm. He’s not a partner and shows up irregularly. He isn’t trying cases. Can you imagine being available to meet people for “hand offs” of money if you were actually expected to perform work? His wealthy dad paid handsomely for Rodney's name to be on the letterhead.

 I urge all of the conservatives who read SRAZ to add this enlightening article to today’s reading list: 
 “Outdated labor unions go racist, support BLM”: 
** https://www.lifezette.com/2020/09/outdated-labor-unions-go-racist-support-blm/?utm_source=activeengage&utm_medium=email  ** 
 It’s filled with information I was unaware of.

 Good information about pompous ass Rodney Glassman. His exceedingly wealthy California-based parents keep his high end lifestyle going while he pretends to be relevant.
