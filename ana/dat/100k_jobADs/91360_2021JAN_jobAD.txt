 Got a job within first week of placement 
 Nov 16 
 Posted by  NaranTeam 
 Shuchi 
 Placements are happening in my college. But it seems that I am not able to crack neither the written exam nor interview. I try to study everything. But I don’t know. I am not able to do well. I can’t even solve the questions. 
 I feel very dishearten when people see me as if I am very poor mind and pity on me. However, I can constantly overcome these feelings. 
 But I want a job this year. Crack all the tests of companies and interviews and also do very good in academics also. I try to study but nothing I understand correctly once and it takes lot of time to complete a topic.

 398: write it in a paper and keep it under the pillow. 
 Shuchi (after a week) 
 Thank you I got a very good job. Amazingly that too in first week of placement. I could have never thought of that……. Thank you…….It was really a miracle for me…
