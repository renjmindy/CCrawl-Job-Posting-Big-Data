 Inside Job 
 Upper East Side 
 Dean & Deluca/ 85th and Madison 
 I was scarfing down a bagel and having an espresso at the Dean & Deluca food shop on the Upper East Side when I realized I was sitting in the perfect corner window to people watch and take pictures. I was off to an appointment so I only managed to get this one shot of this guy adjusting his hood. Not bad for only sitting there a few minutes.
