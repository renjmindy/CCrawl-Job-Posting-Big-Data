  4 Strategies To Minimize Job Hunt Stress  
 Brendan Baker 
 October 09, 2013 
 Job hunting can be a very stressful thing for many people. If you're between jobs, the thought of not having an income for a while can be overwhelming. Not to mention the fact that you need to really impress when it comes to the application process. Like any other type of stress, job hunt stress can become paralyzing and have a hugely negative affect on your ability to source and secure a job. However, there are some simple strategies that you can put in place to minimize your stress and help you land your dream job in a fun and exciting way. 
 
 Strategies To Minimize Job Hunt Stress 
 Below are four actions that you can take to help you minimize stress while job hunting. 
 1. Listen To Music 
 When you're browsing job boards online, tidying up your resume or getting dressed for your upcoming job interview, play some of your favourite tunes and get your groove going. Music has proven to have many scientific benefits that will help you stay relaxed, stay positive and stay focused on the task at hand. Music also creates a more fun environment to help you reduce your job hunt stress. 
 2. Go Somewhere Different 
 There's no need to lock yourself away silently staring at the computer screen at home. You're currently not working, so why not enjoy it as much as you can? Keep things exciting and interesting and make the most of your current time off of work. Go out, find new places and explore the world while you're job hunting. Try going to libraries, cafes, parks, beaches and take your laptop with you. You might just find that when you take yourself out of your normal environment and into something new that you think more clearly, have more positive thoughts and can actually job hunt more effectively and efficiently. This is a sure-fire way of reducing stress while job hunting. 
 3. Join A Class In Your Area Of Specialty 
 This is a great one. Not only will you be keeping up to date with the latest skills and expertise in your industry, you'll also have the opportunity of meeting other people with similar interests and who will also have contacts or networks that you could tap into to support your job hunt. Joining a class will help you stay motivated, energised and focused on what it is that you do best. It will help you maintain your confidence throughout the job application procedure and will ultimately support you in minimising any job hunting stress. If you're at college or university and you're looking for graduate jobs, then you're already in a great place. Speak with your tutors and lecturers and see where they can support you. 
 4. Involve Your Friends And Family 
 Job hunting in isolation can be very stressful. However, there's no reason why it should be done alone. Your family and friends can be your best support while you are job hunting. Not only will your they be there to support you and keep you motivated, they can also act as conduits to more opportunities and a wider network to call upon. The more support from family and friends you have, the more relaxed you will feel while job hunting. All in all, when you're out of work, enjoy it as much as possible while you can! Finding a job can be a full-time job, but you're in control of that full-time job. So why not make it a really fun one?
