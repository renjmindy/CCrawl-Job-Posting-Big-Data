 Sunny Kourkoutis spent six months on unemployment and a couple more working in a job she hated before she found something that suited her restaurant experience. 
 “When I was on unemployment, I could have easily gotten a job as a server,” said Kourkoutis, 42, of Bridgeville. “But at my age, it's not something I really saw myself doing.” 
 In April, Kourkoutis finally found a job she enjoyed. She was hired as reservations manager at Jacksons Restaurant in Cecil and since was promoted to assistant executive manager. In so doing, she joined a hospitality industry that added 8,100 jobs last month and has led growth in the local economy. 
 Employers in the seven-county Pittsburgh region added 22,300 nonfarm jobs in April, and the unemployment rate declined two-tenths of a percentage point to 5.6 percent, according to preliminary figures released on Wednesday by the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry. The decline occurred as 3,900 more people began looking for work, an expression of confidence in Pittsburgh's economy.

 Allentown Arena Construction On Schedule, Mayor Is Pleased 
 
 English: City of Allentown from east side (Photo credit: Wikipedia) 
 Six years ago  Allentown  Mayor Ed Pawlowski, his city still smarting from losing the Sands casino to Bethlehem, first suggested that an arena might make a fine consolation prize. 
 Pawlowski on Wednesday, standing at the city's $272 million arena complex, surrounded by dust and gravel, hard hats and heavy machines, looked downright satisfied. 
 With construction in full swing, steel and concrete rising from what was once a block of low-end stores and for a time just a muddy hole at Seventh and Hamilton streets, Pawlowski, media in tow, got his first tour of a project that he has been trying to make a reality for most of his time in office. 
 "It really is amazing when you think about going from the conceptual stage to something that is physically under construction," Pawlowski said afterward. "I wanted to show the amount of planning that has really gone into this construction process."
