  5 Tips For Staying Motivated During A FRUSTRATING Job Search  
 Ariella Coombs 
 Jenna Arcand 
 September 10, 2020 
   
 Let's face it: job search can be challenging, and staying motivated during a frustrating job search can seem impossible sometimes. However, it's critical that you stay positive. Otherwise, you risk falling into a downward spiral, which will only make things worse. So, how can you get past your job search struggles? 
 Here are some tips for staying motivated during a frustrating job search: 
 1. Find Things You Can Get Excited About 
 What gets you excited? Think about your hobbies and interests. What do you do for fun in your life? Make sure you dedicate at least one day a week to doing what you love. This will help you get your mind off of the negative and focus on the things you enjoy. Looking for a job shouldn't take up all of your time. By customizing your resume for each position you apply for and  writing disruptive cover letters , you won't need to spend hours a day sending your job applications to a dozen different employers. Two or three will do.  For a strategic job search, quality is always better than quantity. It also means you'll stay motivated, won't get burnt out, and still have time to do the things you love to do. Balance is key! 
 2. Surround Yourself With People Who Inspire You 
 When you're feeling down in the dumps, it's important to surround yourself with positivity. Make an effort to meet up with positive influences in your life—your family, friends, significant others, and mentors. These people will help you stay on track. Also, surround yourself with your "virtual mentors," people who inspire you from afar. Whether they're celebrities, successful business people, or authors, keep them "nearby." Read their books or showcase their  inspirational quotes . A little inspiration can go a long way. 
 3. Help Others 
 Helping makes us feel good! If you're feeling bad about yourself, see how you can help someone else. Volunteer. Pay it forward. Give back somehow. This will recharge you and get you in a good mood. Another way to help others is to provide value to your  professional network , whether on LinkedIn or in person. Share articles, videos, or podcasts you find inspirational, informative, and insightful. Offer to help your connections in any way you can. Chances are, they will be more than happy to return the favor, and may refer you to an open position at their company.  Never help anyone with the expectation of receiving something in return, though! If helping others keeps you motivated and makes you feel grateful for what you do have, don't stop doing it while looking for a job.  
 4. Get Some Exercise 
 You've got to expel that negative energy! Make sure you take time to exercise daily. Take a walk. Go for a run. Do yoga. Lift weights. Just get GOING! Exercising equal endorphins and endorphins make you happy. Don't know where to start? Check out this  quick and easy home workout !  
 5. Give Yourself Structure 
 Not having structure can make your life seem unstable. Create a plan for your week on Sunday nights. Have a schedule and stick to it. If you like to-do lists, write one of those, too. You'll feel accomplished at the end of the week when you look back and see everything you got done, while making time for yourself, prioritizing your career as well as your physical and  mental well-being .  
 Staying motivated during a frustrating job search isn't easy. We hope these tips will help you find the motivation to not only land your next job, but also improve your career.  When everything feels overwhelming, just remember to work it daily! Small, consistent actions can make a big difference. Good luck out there. Looking for a job? We can help!

  How To Be A Successful Salesperson (Even During Hard Times)  
 Jenna Arcand 
 July 31, 2020 
   
 Being a successful salesperson is easier said than done. If you're looking to be a better salesperson and reach your career goals, we have some timely advice for you. 
 We recently reached out to  Zac Croteau , one of Work It Daily's old interns, who was willing to share what he's learned as a leading salesperson at Dell. Here are his tips for being a successful salesperson, even during hard times. 
 1. Be The Hardest Worker In The Room 
 "You often hear younger sales professionals asking veteran sales professionals, 'What's the trick?' or 'What's your secret to being successful?' In my opinion, there is no trick or secret to being successful in this profession," Zac says.  To be a successful salesperson, Zac believes you should aim to be the hardest worker in the room.  "Now I say hardest worker, but I don't say work the longest hours. Always look at your strategy and figure out ways you can be better and always look to engage with your customers as much as you can." Doing just that, in Zac's experience, is the first step to  getting ahead  in your sales career.  
 2. Embrace Uncomfortable Conversations 
 "You're often faced with uncomfortable conversations in a sales career," Zac states. "Anytime you're asking someone for money in exchange for a product can be intimidating for even the most seasoned sales professional." Despite this, Zac says you can't be afraid of those  uncomfortable conversations . You must embrace them. "I was told early on in my career that to be successful in this industry, you need to 'get comfortable being uncomfortable.' And that is something that has really stuck with me." 
 3. Be Passionate, Relentless, And Tenacious 
 A common misconception people have about sales is that, in order to be successful, you need to be a "smooth talking, slick, extrovert."  "This is just a stereotype," Zac continues. "I say this because I actually consider myself to be more of an introvert." Based on his experience as a successful salesperson, Zac believes you really only need three specific  soft skills  to be the best in the industry: passion, relentlessness, and tenacity. "Without drive, and a commitment to succeeding, it's hard to have a career in sales. You need to be able to bounce back. As salespeople, we face rejection nearly every day, sometimes multiple times a day. If you can take that rejection and ultimately understand why you're being rejected, you'll be more valuable to your customer as a problem solver, account manager, and trusted advisor." 
 4. Listen And Care 
 Zac's last tip for being a successful salesperson is to simply listen and care. "If you're trying to sell to customers without listening and understanding their problems, you won't sell a thing," Zac states. "I've always been successful because I do everything I can, not only to take the extra mile, but the extra 10 miles to ensure that my customer's experience is the very best it can possibly be." So, how do you ensure your customers are having the best experience? Zac believes your job is not only to sell, but to be a trusted advisor to all of your customers. "Listen and understand the challenges they are facing, bring in the  correct resources  to further the discussion, and develop solutions that will solve each of those challenges for your customer." Don't be surprised if you build strong relationships with your customers after employing this strategy. That is definitely one of the perks of having a career in sales.  
 "To know that I am taking an active part in assisting my customer in developing solutions to whatever challenge they face, I would say that is my favorite part of this job," Zac says. Even during tough times, if you follow these four tips, you'll find success as a salesperson. Many thanks to Zac Croteau for his contributions to this article! Looking for a job? We can help!

  Federal Unemployment Extension: 5 Tips For Career Success If The $600 Unemployment Benefits End  
 Jenna Arcand 
 July 21, 2020 
   
 The federal government has yet to announce their decision about extending the $600 unemployment benefits to those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. If those benefits go away, what will that mean for your career? Are you prepared to find a new job, or possibly even change careers? 
 By the time we know for sure what's happening with the  federal unemployment extension , you may be behind in the job search process compared to the competition. So, it's in your best interest to begin positioning yourself for career success now. Here are some tips for setting yourself up for career success once the $600 federal  unemployment benefits  end. 
 1. Optimize Your Resume & LinkedIn Profile 
 If you've been putting off updating your resume or  optimizing your LinkedIn profile  while unemployed, it's time to get down to business. We know it was easy to procrastinate when the whole world shut down for a few months and went into quarantine, but the reality is, the pandemic won't last forever. When we're safely out of COVID-19's reach, and the federal unemployment benefits end, you will have to face some hard truths about your career.  This is difficult. We understand how crushing unemployment can be.  The good news is that once you optimize your resume and LinkedIn profile, you'll have momentum pushing you in the right direction.   Get all of your career materials in order. Make sure you're focusing on your relevant skills and the  skillsets that'll be in demand after COVID-19 . This will help you articulate your specialty or "service" you provide to employers to show your value immediately, the moment they glance at your resume or view your LinkedIn profile. Also, make sure your  resume can get past the ATS . If it can't do that, all your job applications will be a waste of time.  
 2. Think About Your Career Goals 
 Many people have used downtime in quarantine to reflect on their lives and their careers—unemployed or not. The disruption caused by COVID-19 coupled by the thin security blanket of federal unemployment benefits has created the perfect space for a lot of professionals to think about where they are in their careers, what they want to achieve, and whether they're happy or not.  Are you in the same boat?  If you haven't thought about your career goals in a while, starting to think about them now will help you figure out your next career move.  Do you want to  change careers ? Do you want to find a similar job to the one you had before becoming unemployed? Are you forced to change careers due to COVID-19 and finally have an opportunity to  pursue your dreams ? It's important to have short and long-term goals. Reflect on your career and be honest with yourself. Where do you want to be next year? In five years? Getting clear on your goals will make it easier to position yourself for career success, no matter which industry you're in. 
 3. Create An Interview Bucket List 
 An interview bucket list is a list of 10 to 20 companies that you would love to work for that also hire for your skill sets. If you're passionate about a product or service they provide, connect with their mission, or are inspired by their innovation and great company culture, then the company probably belongs on your list.  One of the most effective ways to find a job even in the toughest of times is to create an interview bucket list and then try to  network your way  into those companies by  connecting with current employees on LinkedIn .  The purpose of an interview bucket list is to help you be intentional with your networking and job search so you don't waste your time.  You should have an interview bucket list whether you're secure in your job or not. Since federal unemployment benefits probably won't be extended, knowing which companies to target in your job search now will help you be more efficient and land a job quicker.  
 4. Learn How To Write A Disruptive Cover Letter 
 Nothing will make you stand out to employers more than a  disruptive cover letter . And in the age of COVID-19, standing out in the job search has never been more important and vital to your career. With the federal unemployment benefits ending soon, more people will be looking for a job than during all of quarantine. Depending on where you live, your local economy could be opening back up again, attracting more job seekers than usual due to mass layoffs earlier in the year.  A disruptive cover letter is the key to  standing out from all this competition .  The best disruptive cover letters tell a story. A compelling one, too. The story you tell should explain why you feel connected to the company while also emphasizing what you are excited about doing if you get the position. Even if you don't have the exact experience they're looking for in a job candidate, you can usually make up for it with enthusiasm and a great connection story. 
 5. Cut Spending Where You Can (If You Haven't Already) 
 One thing is for certain: COVID-19 made us realize how quickly everything can change. Those who have been  laid off  now need to figure out how they will manage financially when the $600 unemployment benefits end.  Hopefully when the COVID-19 pandemic first started, you doubled down on expenses, prioritized  saving money , and cut any unnecessary spending to better prepare yourself for any financial uncertainty coming your way.  If you haven't done so already, now is the time to get serious about a budget, in case your job search takes longer than expected.   Don't forget to review your bills to ensure you're still using the services you're paying for. If you can live without them, why not get rid of them until you feel secure in your career again? The extra money will help ease your financial concerns a little as you look for a new job.  
 Whether the federal government approves an extension of the $600 unemployment benefits or not, you should be ready to jump back into the job market with all the necessary tools under your belt.  If you want to position yourself for career success after COVID-19, just follow the five tips above.  Need more help with your career?

  6 Tips For Kick-Starting Your Career This Summer  
 Miles Young 
 Jenna Arcand 
 June 16, 2020 
   
 What plans do you have for your summer vacation? Will you be working on your tan or enjoying the air conditioning at the mall? These activities might be fun, but they won't help you get ahead in your career. 
 Instead of the traditional summer activities, try being more proactive this season to jump-start your career. Here are some tips for kick-starting your career this summer: 
 1. Wake Up Early 
 The first rule for having a proactive summer is to get out of bed. It sounds simple, but you'll be surprised by how many hours you waste lolling about in bed in your pajamas. Setting your alarm to maintain your regular routine will ensure you don't waste time that could otherwise be used pursuing career-advancing activities and having fun. Just think how much you'll get done with a few hours head start on the competition! 
 2. Take On Volunteer Work 
 Taking on volunteer work is another valuable way to spend your summer while unemployed or on a break from school. Some students may find volunteer opportunities that naturally fit with their career aspirations. For example, you may like to volunteer in an old people's home or hospice if you want to become a nurse. However, volunteering can also give you an opportunity to  pursue a passion , like helping people with learning disabilities to read or tending to animals in a wildlife sanctuary. Studies suggest that no matter what volunteering position you pursue, it'll increase your chances of finding employment by 27%. That makes it much more productive than the bulk of summer activities.  
 3. Get A Summer Job 
 Even a summer job that's unrelated to your desired career can be valuable. As you look for a job, you'll gain interview skills and learn how to cope with rejection. Once you land a summer position, you'll learn how to deal with the public, take on responsibility, and be accountable to others.  A summer job will also help build up your resume. Any work experience is better than no work experience. The fewer  job gaps in your resume , the easier it'll be for you to explain why you were unemployed in a job interview, too. 
 4. Start Freelancing 
 Your summer vacation gives you the ideal opportunity to get a freelance business off the ground. Consider what skills you have and start marketing them to potential clients. Writing, designing, translating, and computer programming are all talents ideally suited to freelancing. Several websites also showcase job opportunities for freelance workers. Many feature short-term opportunities that are ideal for students or  unemployed professionals  looking to gain work experience (and make some money) while hunting for a full-time job. Taking on these roles will help you beef up your resume and build your professional network.  
 5. Get An Internship 
 Many companies offer  internships to students on their summer vacations . These positions don't often pay well, but they'll give you invaluable work experience and insight into your dream career. You might become even more passionate about your career direction or decide that your chosen career path isn't for you. Whatever the case, you'll be able to apply what you've learned at school to real-world situations and make valuable connections. The company you're interning for will probably provide you with a reference, and you might even get a job offer out of it. If you're not a college student, you can still get an internship!   Mid-career internships , also known as "minternships," are on the rise. They're perfect for professionals considering a career change, but aren't sure if they want to make that leap yet. So, if you're unemployed this summer and want to explore a new career, a minternship could be for you.  
 6. Shop For A Professional Wardrobe 
 Even shopping at the mall can be productive if you put your time to good use. Rather than searching for another pair of jeans or a cute pair of sunglasses, keep your eyes peeled for a great professional wardrobe. Every workplace has a different dress code. When going in for job interviews, the general rule of thumb is to dress one level above the current employees. For this reason, it's always a good idea to have a solid professional wardrobe ready. You never know when a job opportunity will pop up! 
 Don't let another summer pass you by! Put your free time to good use and get a jump-start on your career this season with these six tips.  Looking for a job? We can help!
