 This team is responsible for all software and tooling used in the development of Ledger client applications. 
 Role overview 
 The DAML Application Runtime team is responsible for all software and tooling used in the development of Ledger client applications. This ranges from JavaScript code generation and libraries used in UIs, to frameworks that abstract over common tasks and provide simpler APIs to users to services, and APIs to implement and deploy ledger automation. 
 As a software engineer on the DAML Application Runtime team, you have the unique opportunity to build an ecosystem of tools that enable an exciting new class of smart contract, distributed ledger applications. Youâ€™ll develop the tools, APIs and frameworks used in the development of smart contract applications. You will get to extend and improve existing software as well as develop entirely new services to address the issues faced by DAML users in their applications. 
 Key Responsibilities 
 
 Work on frameworks and tooling used directly by customers in their ledger client applications 
 Deliver high quality and well-tested code efficiently and at pace in a Scala-focused codebase 
 Address production requirements from customers by making services more reliable and easier to inspect 
 Follow a collaborative approach that fosters, embraces, and insists upon diverse perspectives. We are a team where everyone pulls more than their weight, where everyone matters and all opinions are valuable. 
 
 Key Criteria 
 
 Proven history of delivering services running in a production setup. 
 Excellent programming skills and experience in at least one modern and/or functional programming language, ideally on the JVM, including, but not limited, to Java 8+, Scala, Kotlin, Haskell. 
 Experience instrumenting applications for production usage, e.g., adding logging, metrics and tracing functionality. 
 Self reliant and thrives on continuous learning. 
 Experience working in an open source environment.
