 Job: Information Manager (Oil & Gas) 
 Posted on  January 3, 2015  by   sarahgprescott 
 1/3/15 -  Information Manager (Oil& Gas) 
Sue Hill Recruitment (company not named), London: "based overseas" (without saying where) 
 Sarah P 's comments : for business librarians and those with IT skills and/or training, this is an opportunity. My experience with gas & oil companies is that the pay is usually generous and they generally take good care of their employees however the position might not be in a 'garden spot'. (Our positions in Libya were funded by an oil company and they paid our transportation expenses and four months salary when we were evacuated from Libya.) FYI: you will need to ask what nationalities are allowed to apply.
