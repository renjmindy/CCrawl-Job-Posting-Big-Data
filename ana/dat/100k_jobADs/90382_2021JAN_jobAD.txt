  12 Tips For A Great Job Interview  
 Damien L. Butler 
 February 24, 2014 
 I recently had the opportunity to be a guest on CAREEREALISM TV to share ways to nail your next job interview. Below is a list of some of the points that were discussed.  Related:   Interview Cheat Sheet: 8 Tips For A Flawless Interview  This is not an all-inclusive, 100% foolproof plan, but it is a plan; and if you at least follow step one, you are on your way to your second interview - and a possible job offer. Best of luck to you.  1. Plan for the Interview:  If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail!  2. Be Confident:  You are that good! The company saw something in you to bring you in for the interview. Show confidence and competence.  3. Research the Company:  Learn about the company. Study their website, financial reports and or recent news articles.  4. Practice for the Interview:  Have someone ask you the type of questions you will be asked during your interview.  5. Prepare Questions for the Interview:  You can prepare questions based off of your research of the company.  You can also find list of questions on here .  6. Know your resume:  Even if you wrote your resume, review what’s on it so you aren’t surprised by any interview questions about your work history.  7. Panel/Group Interview Tips:  Eye contact, remember names, include all panel members, research other members if possible, be inclusive  8. Sell yourself (You are your Brand!):  An outstanding CEO once told me that you are hire based on your personality aptitude and experience. Be prepared to talk about it.  9. Salary negotiation is Secondary:  Get the job offer first!  10. Older (often Overqualified) workers starting at a new company:  Highlight your skills and sell them as an investment for the future. If the need arises, you have the skills needed to help the company immediately without an extensive time consuming search.  11. Thank you notes are important for post interview communication:  You may not get this job but with a timely thank you note you position yourself to be remembered for a future opportunity. A “no” simply mean not now. It does not mean not ever.  12. The Bottom Line:  Be Confident; Be Prepared; Be Open; Be Honest; Be Collaborative; Be a Problem Solver; Look for and highlight opportunities to help that company move forward!
