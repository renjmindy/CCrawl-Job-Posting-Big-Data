 Tessian 
 Tessian protects every business's mission by securing the human layer. 
 We're building intelligent security that works for human beings _  as they are_, not how security policies would like them to be. Using machine learning technology, Tessian automatically predicts and eliminates advanced threats on email caused by human error - like data exfiltration, accidental data loss, business email compromise and phishing attacks - with minimal disruption to employees' workflow. As a result, employees are empowered to do their best work, without security getting in their way. 
 Founded in 2013, Tessian is backed by renowned investors like Sequoia, Accel and Balderton and has hubs in San Francisco, Boston, and London. 
 ystems power the whole company and our teams have touch points with all of our engineering teams. From deploying data science models in production, to integrating with our front-end, you'll be involved in projects that span all aspects of the business. 
 Our teams are made up of people from diverse backgrounds; some have been building Python systems for years and some have learnt the ins and outs of Python on the job. 
 Please note, this role will require being able to come into to our London office (Liverpool Street) once restrictions lift; you'll get plenty of work from home, however you'll want to be within commuting distance to come in for training & regular team meetings.
