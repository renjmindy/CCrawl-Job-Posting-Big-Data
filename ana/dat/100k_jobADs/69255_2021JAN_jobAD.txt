 Hello everyone, 
I am extremely apologetic if in recent months our service standards do not meet your satisfaction. We have lost a few employees to the big boys aka MBS and RW, so we are working with just half our strength. We are trying our best to hire more staff to cope. It is almost a struggle to keep up. Good service crew are impossible to find these days. We work on a 'less is more' system where we hire people of caliber rather than a bunch of zombies. 
 If you know anyone looking for career in the F&B, please let us know. 
 P.S Li lin, thanks for reminding me to update this blog.
