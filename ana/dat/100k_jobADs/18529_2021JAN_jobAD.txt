 About this project 
 it-programming / others-5 
 USD 250 - 500 
 We are looking for a game designer (with experience), to design a catchy, simple, cute game for our non-profit project. The game is to increase donations for food banks, which are non-profits. That means, it has to be simple and quick so it doesnt get in the way of the donation. 
 We have a lot of work in this area. The first project is more a test for a long term investment.
