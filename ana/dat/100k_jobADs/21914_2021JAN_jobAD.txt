 How to use 'bracketology' to add a little 'March Madness' to your job search 
 March 15, 2016March 15, 2016 Eileen Kohan 
 This is the time of year when everyone, including the President is selecting who they believe will advance to the final four in the NCAA men’s and women’s basketball championships. With a little imagination, you can use the bracket concept as a decision matrix to manage career choice, job search or your network. 
 In 2007, sportswriters  Richard Sandomir  and  Mark Reiter  published  'The Enlightened Bracketologist: The Final Four of Everything' , applying the methodology of March Madness to everyday decisions. 
 " Bracketology—the practice of parsing people, places, and things into discrete one-on-one matchups to determine which of the two is superior or preferable—works because it is simple. It is a system that helps us make clearer and cleaner decisions about what is good, better, best in our world. What could be simpler than breaking down a choice into either/or, black or white, this one or that one?" 
 How can we apply the scaffolding of March Madness to job search? Let’s say you are totally undecided (confused, terrified, ambivalent) about your next career move. All you know is you're not happy with your current work situation. Where do you begin? 
 Try categorizing your interests using the bracket system. Instead of four regions, fill in four career fields that might interest you. Next, identify sixteen possible employers in each field. Once you have your potential employer roster identified, begin your research. 
 This may be a good time to develop a parallel list of contacts: a bracket representing your network. Use the same four career categories and identify folks who have broad expertise in the profession. In this 'exploration' phase you are aggregating data about industry trends, market leaders, and potential for growth. 
 As you progress with your data gathering, you will begin to eliminate some organizations in favor of others. Once you get to your ‘elite eight’ employers, schedule your in-depth information interviews. 
 As you talk to people you will begin to establish a realistic assessment of 'organization fit', and evaluate your chances for success. 
 The ‘elite eight’ forms your target list. By the time you have narrowed your selection to eight, you should feel comfortable that each employer presents a realistic starting point in the next phase your career. 
 As with any selection process, you don't have total control. The employer extends the offer and you have the choice to accept or continue to pursue other options. 
 The NCAA tournament lasts three weeks. If you start filling in your career brackets now, you will advance through the exploration process at a pace to be ready for interviews by ‘tip-off’ in the championship game. 
 Its time to add a little 'March Madness' to your job search, and some fun to a typically stressful routine.
