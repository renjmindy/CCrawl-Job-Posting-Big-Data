 Graphic designers are in high demand, and graphic design job opportunities continue to grow. With businesses' increased need for promotional materials, the market for graphic design services has skyrocketed. It continues to evolve and offer opportunities for freelancers looking to succeed as an entrepreneur. Every company needs a graphic designer to either have in-house or hire remotely. Freelancer graphic designers who keep up their skills and market themselves, can create a steady income. 
 The key is to stay on top of your skill and industry trends. Here are tips to help you build a successful career as a graphic designer. 
 Stay Relevant and Visible 
 Keep up with market trends and focus on building your brand. Being a graphic designer involves a high level of creativity, not just in your designs but in how you stay on top in your field and market yourself. A great way to show off your relevance and talent, as well as to market yourself, is through a  graphic design portfolio . 
 Get Comfortable With Yourself 
 As a designer, it is important to understand the ins and outs of yourself. Creativity has to flow. And to be able to offer a client what they need, you must be able to acknowledge your strengths and weaknesses. 
 Be Careful about Using Your Personal Contacts for Business 
 It is okay to reach out to potential clients that are acquaintances, but be sensitive when asking for a favor. Your personal friends may not need your services, or may be wary about turning a friendship into a business relationship. 
 Story Board Client Work 
 To best understand what your client is asking for, consider outlining and drafting the project on a vision or story board. Let the creativity run through you. This will help you get clarity as well as allow creativity to flow and generate more ideas. 
 Graphic Design Jobs 
 If you have training or experience in graphic design and you want to find work. Start by getting familiar with the types of work graphic designers do. 
 Graphic Design 
 Businesses often hire graphic designers to create company logos, graphics for websites, and product illustrations. Keep a portfolio of previous work examples, to show potential clients. Businesses that can see the quality, uniqueness, and creativity of your work are more likely to hire you. 
 Website Development 
 Many graphic designers are asked to create materials for websites. This means the business has to hire two people, the graphic designer and web designer. You can increase your opportunities and income if you can do both, and do  Web development . 
 Social Media Marketing Specialist 
 Are you good at designing catchy photos that can grab the attention of people on social media? If so, offer your services to a business that might need help with their daily social media posting. 
 How To Drum Up Business 
 Getting started as a graphic designer isn't hard, but it does take planning and focus. 
 Build a Portfolio 
 Start building your website/portfolio now. This will show off your experience, talent and work with past clients. Make sure the design is clean and easy to evaluate. Poor design or low graphic resolution can hurt how potential clients view your work. Create an “About” page or section to help your prospects get to know you. Showcase your best work. 
 Use Social Media To Get Noticed 
 Social media marketing is a great way to get noticed. Use accounts like Facebook, Pinterest, and Instagram to show off the quality of your graphic design skills. Consider joining LinkedIn to network for clients. 
 Direct Targeting 
 If you like working with a specific type of client, search for them online and visit their website. Grab their email address and shoot them a message. You can also use direct messaging on sites like Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Instead of saying, "Hire me," consider offering to help them with something. People are more likely to respond to messages that offer value and support, over ones that ask for money. 
 If they respond and need some assistance, great! If not, keep it moving and remain positive. There are thousands of opportunities out there waiting for you. 
 Job Boards 
 This is one of the best ways to get hired. Many businesses post their graphic design needs on websites that offer  job boards . Join a few of them and sign up to their email list. You will be able to receive updates via email on a regular basis.
