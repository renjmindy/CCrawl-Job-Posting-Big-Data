 Looking for a job – but how? 
 People with higher educational qualifications have a greater chance of finding a job in Germany. 
 University graduates and highly-qualified specialists have good job prospects. Numerous job offers can often be found in the fields of technology, ICT and engineering across the entire State of Hessen. 
 Hessen’s labour market also has good perspectives for professionals with vocational qualifications. Skilled professionals are especially sought after in the craft sector, but also in the healthcare and nursing sector. Teachers have good career opportunities in Hessen’s towns and cities. 
 Here you can find some tips on what to consider when looking and applying for a job.
