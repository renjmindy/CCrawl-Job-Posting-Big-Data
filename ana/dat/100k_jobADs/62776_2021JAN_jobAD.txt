  Discover Your Values to Locate Career Success  
 Bud Bilanich 
 March 16, 2011 
 Success Tweets : Your values come from deep inside you. Spend the time necessary to discover them. Then hold fast to them. Honor them with your actions.  I love blogging. It gives me the opportunity to share my thoughts and ideas with people who can’t afford my  career success  coach services. It also keeps me sharp. My thinking on life and career success has grown and developed because of this blog. I hope this is reflected in the quality of my posts. I think I give my better career advice as a result of writing this blog. There is a side benefit to blogging too. People send me free books in the hopes that I will review them. A while back, I received a copy of Masha Malka’s latest book,  The One Minute Coach . It’s a great little book. Masha has organized  The One Minute Coach  into bite sized chunks. One three paragraph chapter entitled,  What Does it Take to Be Attractive?  makes a great point about being true to yourself... 
 “Being attractive comes from having that magnetic power that pulls people towards you. A power that inspires them to talk to you and find out more about who are; a power that makes them want to be like you!” 
 
 She follows this up with five action steps. I love the fifth step… 
 “Focus on who you are and not just what you look like. People fall in love with the essence of you – your energy, the sparkle in your eyes, your passion for living, your unconditional love, everything that makes you unique and special…people fall in love with your beautiful soul.” 
 What is your essence, your beautiful soul? It lies in your personal values. Do you let your essence and values shine through? Or do you keep them both under wraps, thinking that you won’t measure up in others’ eyes if you let your true self show. When I was in high school and reading  Hamlet  , we got to the point in the play where Hamlet is setting off to avenge his father. Polonius gives him some advice. We were reading the play out loud. I was reading just before Polonius’ advice. Mrs. Yothers, stopped me and said,  “This is some of the best advice on life that you will ever get. Read slowly Bud, and the rest of you should listen closely.”  I can’t remember the entire verse anymore, but there was one line that has always stuck with me:  “And above all else, to thine own self be true, and it must follow as the day the night, thou canst be false to no man.”  When my nephew Matt Seaton was going off to college, his grandfather and my father-in-law, Roy Blackman, gave him a piece of advice written on a scrap of paper. It read,  “TTOSBT – figure it out and live by it.”  Can you figure it out? Here’s a hint, read the quote from Polonius. The common sense career success coach point here is simple. We are all unique human beings. Each of us has wonderful traits. Our best traits come from deep inside ourselves, our personal values. We all need to have the confidence to let our wonders shine through. You create positive personal impact when you live by your values and let your essence shine through. Pay attention to the advice in Tweet 20 in  Success Tweets  ,  "Your values come from deep inside you. Spend the time necessary to discover them. Then hold fast to them. Honor them with your actions."  Honor your values in the way you live your life. Let your values shine through the next time you are in a room full of strangers. You might be surprised at the way people respond to you.  Bud Bilanich  is a motivational speaker, author and blogger who will help you create the life and career success you want and deserve.
