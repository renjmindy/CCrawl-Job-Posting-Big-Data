 Six Tips for How to Land a Job from Our Recruiter of the Year! 
 02/01/2019BY: Tracey Mesken 
 ​  Are you looking to land a new role in 2019? We had a chat with Jennifer, WorkPac’s 2018 Recruitment Coordinator of the Year, about what helps someone stand out as a great candidate to a recruiter. 
 ​ 
 In her last 4.5 years with WorkPac, Jennifer has placed people in roles in mining, civil, retail, white collar, admin and commercial. Beyond being a fantastic recruiter, her experience and knowledge of a variety of industries makes her the perfect person to give tips on putting together your resume and nailing the interview with your WorkPac recruitment coordinator. Here are Jennifer’s top six job tips: 
 1. When it comes to your resume, keep it simple! 
The best resumes are ones that are super simple and easy to read. Or as Jennifer puts it: short, sharp and shiny! When talking about any tickets and licences, outline them in dot points instead of long paragraphs, as this is much easier for our recruiters to read and gives them the information they need quickly. You can learn more tips on writing your resume here. 
 2. It’s not just where you worked, it’s what you did: 
When outlining your work history in your resume, Jennifer says to make sure you provide a brief description of your duties in your previous roles. It’s not enough to just say you worked as a labourer, recruiters need to know what you did as a labourer in that role – were you digging trenches, laying pipes, putting up temporary fencing? Knowing these details will help your recruitment coordinator work out what roles you can be matched to. 
 3. Arrive to the interview prepared 
Recruiters want you to bring along a copy of your most recent resume and all your tickets and licences along to the interview. For clothing, stick to smart casual; you don’t need to wear a three-piece suit, but make sure you look presentable. You can read more tips on interview attire here. 
 4. Be confident 
During the interview, Jennifer believes it’s important that you can speak confidently about your skills and experience. It doesn’t matter if you’re more of a shy person, so long as you can clearly talk about your attitude, approach to safety and the roles you’ve worked. For more great advice for your interview, we’ve compiled 34 crucial tips here. 
 5. Keep the conversation professional and positive 
Be careful to not let the conversation steer negative; Jennifer says people will often talk about disagreements with previous workmates or speak poorly of former employers, which comes across as unprofessional. Even though our recruiters are very friendly and want you to feel comfortable speaking with them in your interview, you need to keep in mind that we’re your employer. 
 6. Be specific about the type of work you’re looking for 
As Jennifer explains, if we don’t know what kind of work you’re looking for, we won’t be able to find you work. People often say that they don’t mind the work they do, or they’ll do anything, as they think it increases the roles they can be put forward for. However, it does the complete opposite. Our recruiters want to know the specifics on what roles you can do and what roles you want to do. So before the interview, make sure you know what you want and can clearly tell us! If you can’t decide, check out our job vacancies to get an idea of what’s out there.
