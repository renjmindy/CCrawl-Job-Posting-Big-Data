 New York on the Job Injury Lawyer 
 Our on the job injury lawyer at Polsky, Shouldice & Rosen, P.C. represents workers in the New York area who were hurt in workplace accidents. Though workplace accidents occur daily in this state, many injured workers do not realize how vulnerable they are to being taken advantage of by their employer or the workers compensation insurance carrier when it comes to receiving benefits. Serious accidents usually result in costly medical care, time off from work, and other damages. Though you may be covered by workers compensation insurance, and they are responsible for covering your damages, they may be more focused on preserving their profits. As a result, the injured worker may lose out on benefits they are entitled to receive. A seasoned on the job injury lawyer from Polsky, Shouldice & Rosen, P.C. can protect your rights and ensure you receive the maximum amount of benefits for which you qualify. Call us today to discuss your case with our on the job injury lawyer. 
 Workers Compensation Benefits 
 You may already know that as an employee of a company, you are likely covered by workers compensation insurance should you get injured while working. There are few exceptions to this general rule and are mostly limited to companies of only a few employees. In addition, not all injury accidents are covered by workers compensation such as when the injured worker was intoxicated and caused the accident. Upon reviewing your case, our  on the job injury lawyer in New York  can determine if you are eligible for workers compensation benefits. 
 How Our New York on the Job Injury Lawyer Can Make a Difference 
 Though you can certainly file for workers compensation benefits on your own, should your claim be of significant value, you may greatly benefit from the legal guidance of an on the job injury lawyer in New York from our firm. This is because the more money the insurance carrier is likely to have to pay out, the harder they will try to lessen that amount so as to protect their profit margin. They may even deny your claim despite its validity. Here are some of the many ways in which they will try to cheat an injured worker out of the benefits to which they are entitled: 
 
 Your claim may be denied. The reason given may be an accusation that your injury is pre-existing and was not as a result of an on the job injury. Or, they may deny it on the basis that you are not actually injured. Our on the job injury lawyer in New York can present proof and documentation of your injury, and demand a fair settlement on your behalf. 
 Your settlement may be indefinitely delayed. In the worst case scenarios, a workers compensation carrier may delay in the hopes that the injured worker simply gives up or passes away as a result of their injury. Our on the job injury lawyer in New York will aggressively pursue a settlement in a timely manner. Should the carrier continue to delay,  Polsky, Shouldice & Rosen, P.C.  can file a lawsuit against them on your behalf.
