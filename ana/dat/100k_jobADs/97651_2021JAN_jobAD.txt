 Adani has started roadworks for the Carmichael mine site under current legal approvals in order to continue to deliver as many jobs and contracts to the regions as possible. Adani Mining has engaged a regional Queensland business to carry out various works on the Carmichael mine access road. 
 Work has commenced on grid bypasses, which will allow larger machinery and equipment to be transported to site. 
 Adani Mining CEO Lucas Dow said the works were permitted under its current approvals and would also benefit future mines in the Galilee Basin. "The road upgrades are an important step to prepare for the construction of the Carmichael Project to ensure larger equipment can be transported to site, and the infrastructure meets future demand for increased traffic," Dow said. 
 "We're getting on with doing everything we can under our current approvals. "In terms of getting started on the mine, we have submitted our remaining management plans." 
 "In relation to the approval of these plans and getting started, we have certainty of process and timing at both the Federal and Local Government levels however the Queensland Government has to date been unwilling to commit." 
 "We are simply seeking a fair go from the Queensland Government, as we are committed and wanting to start delivering upon the 1500 direct jobs and 6750* supporting jobs that the Carmichael Project will deliver for central and northern Queensland. "The Carmichael Project represents a real opportunity for regions to share in the benefits and we are ready and able to deliver." 
 "We've proven time and again that our project stacks up economically, financially and environmentally and we're committed to seeing this project through. We are already delivering jobs to North and Central Queensland." 
 "We know there are thousands of jobseekers ready to work and it's frustrating when the Queensland Government continues to move the goal posts and make changes at the 11th hour, to what should be standard approval processes," Dow said. Adani has now appointed a number of contractors and suppliers including two Wangan and Jagalingou certified businesses, opening up employment opportunities for Indigenous communities. 
 *The Queensland Resources Council's economic modelling states for every 1 direct job in the Queensland resources industry, 4.5 additional indirect jobs are supported. There will be approximately 1500 direct jobs during the initial construction and ramp up of the Carmichael Project, which will support 6750 additional jobs.
