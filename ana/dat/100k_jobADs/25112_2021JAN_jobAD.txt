 How to Kickstart Your Career in Ten Minutes 
 Posted on  May 21, 2018  by  grizzlysalesforce 
 LinkedIn is a popular form of professional social media and online resume building, but the true muscle is in the myriad of hidden features. By taking advantage of everything the site has to offer, you can get a leg up on the job hunt in a matter of minutes. 
 
 Groups 
 
 Here at  Grizzly Sales Force , we know that the secret sauce of a strong professional network is exclusivity. Creating a group of people based on a shared professional interest can drastically boost your success on this platform and beyond. When considering your connections, i.e “1st level, 2nd level, 3rd.,” the power of the group is in the maximization. When posting about a job change, a job search, an accomplishment, etc. in the group, your announcement is boosted beyond those 1st level connections. 
 
 Publications 
 
 Are you an aspiring journalist? Highlight your work in the publications tab with direct links to your articles. Not to mention, this feature is apt for showing off social media management work through Instagram feeds or editorial blogs. Advertising your creative work in such a dynamic way will set you apart from the drab of bulleted links. 
 
 Connections @ Company 
 
 Congrats, you’ve found your dream company! LinkedIn has even done you the favor of showing you that you are a “perfect match” for this company, with all of the qualifications of a potential employee. The key to success after the first “congratulations!” notification, is forging deeper connections. Lucky for you, LinkedIn shows any and all connections you may have at the company for potential contact. Our advice here at  Grizzly Sales Force  is to take that gift and run with it. Contact those connections, because you never know will end up in your corner. 
 
 Career Advice 
 
 An overused piece of advice to students and young professionals is “find a mentor.” However, we know that is much easier said than done. With LinkedIn, the professional fantasy of a wiser, older guru with years of experience to help guide you through the trials and tribulations of your chosen career path is now a reality. By opting into the “Career Advice” feature, you are opening yourself to the opportunity to gain valuable advice from behind your screen. 
 
 “Get Introduced” 
 
 Looking for a way in? When you stumble upon a connection of a connection, you have the opportunity through LinkedIn to “Get Introduced Through a Connection.” Skip the uncomfortable, “Didn’t you work with her? Could you introduce me?” text. We think you should let LinkedIn do the dirty work for you. 
 In the modern digital age, much of the professional networking happens through social media, and the key to a successful career is harnessing that knowledge. Here at  Grizzly Sales Force  we feel confident that you too can harness this knowledge to transform your career in minute
