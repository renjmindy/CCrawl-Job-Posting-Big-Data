 Job Seekers FAQ 
 Frequently Asked Questions 
 What is the federal minimum wage? 
 The federal minimum wage is currently $7.25 per hour. 
 During a job interview, how do I discuss being fired from a job? 
 Be prepared to briefly discuss what happened in a truthful but non-damaging manner. Many people make the mistake of going into too many details or criticizing the employer for what happened. Provide positive information and draw attention to information that lets the employer know you will do well in the future. Some people mention what they learned from the experience. 
 Do I need to send a cover letter with a resume? 
 Most job descriptions donâ€™t mention sending a cover letter; however, you may receive bonus points for taking time to write a customized business letter that highlights specific qualifications for the position you 
seek. Reinforce your fit for the job rather than outline a general summary of your career. If you are emailing your resume, provide information in the body of an email rather than send a separate attachment for a cover letter. 
 What are the best job-search Web sites? 
 WorkInTexas.com  has postings for state agencies and other pubic and private companies. This site provides job matches and options for filling out a state application and online resume for employers to view. Other popular job-search sites are  monster.com ,  careerbuilder.com  and  indeed.com . 
 How do I overcome age discrimination? 
 Target companies that hire people of all ages and who appreciate the advantages of hiring more experienced employees. In your resume, highlight information that matches the job rather than add details that draw attention to age. Omit school graduation and employment dates that are several decades old. Be prepared in job interviews to discuss how you are well-qualified, not over-qualified. 
 Is there some way to express my satisfaction with Workforce Solutions Rural Capital Area Job Seeker services? 
 Yes. Take our online  Job Seeker Customer Survey . 
 Who do I contact for unemployment insurance information? 
 The Texas Workforce Commission handles all Unemployment Insurance claims through statewide Tele-Centers. You may contact them by phone at 800-939-6631, or online at  TexasWorkforce.org
