 I hope everyone had a good holiday season. I was busy gift wrapping presents at Game Stop (second year doing this) promoting my businesses. I managed to get some holiday photos as well while attending the holiday open house at the Mill Ridge Retirement Center. 
 For New Year's Eve, I enjoyed a short firework show in Port Townsend as well as a good meal at Nifty Fifty's (an old 1950's diner with the best sundaes and salmon burgers). 
 Tomorrow, Wednesday, January 7, 2015 from 10 am to noon at the Tacoma News Tribune Job Club will resume.
