 Good job with “Bad Blood”: Grey’s Anatomy and Jehovah’s Witnesses 
 Posted on  February 1, 2013  by  StephenJLind   57 Comments 
 ABC’s hit medical drama “ Grey’s Anatomy ” finds its best religious tone yet in last night’s “ Bad Blood ” episode. A patient dies on the table because his Jehovah’s Witness faith prohibits blood transfusions, one intern struggles with the ethics of the situation, and the family is cast as distraught-but-not-crazy in their faithfulness to their beliefs. Even with the brief time allotted to this storyline amidst a routinely busy episode, Grey’s manages to keep a tricky subject complex and open. 
 
 In the show’s ninth season, as the hospital begins to close its ER doors in preparation to be sold, a boy is brought into the hospital with severe injuries. The unconscious boy needs surgery, but Dr. Yang (Sandra Oh) is forced to proceed with a “ bloodless surgery ,” forgoing the use of critically important blood transfusion, because the boy has a Jehovah’s Witness alert tag. 
 Like the episode correctly portrays,  JW faith prohibits blood transfusions . Grey’s doesn’t take the time to explain that it’s atypical interpretation of Bible passages like  Acts 15  and  Leviticus 17  that leads to the sect’s belief, but it rightly shows the JW family as devoutly holding to their belief. It is a defining doctrine of the church, and those who disobey can find themselves excommunicated. 
 The family, though, was not portrayed as particularly irrational or crazy, which is a refreshing turn in the often oversimplified “conflict” between science and faith. While no major character expresses agreement or empathy with the religious creed, respect is shown for the belief system. In fact, viewers were able to at least sympathize with the family, as the actors playing the boy’s parents do a good job of showing the emotional toll of holding to one’s life-threatening faith. 
 It’s not the show’s job to promote JW beliefs, but it goes a long way toward open dialogue on spirituality when the religious peculiarity is not shown as being held by a bunch of nutcases. One intern struggles with her medical role, not understanding how to respect a patient’s beliefs when blood transfusions are so routine and so important. She even tries to sneak in a blood bag, which Yang had already warned could result in assault and battery charges. 
 Yet again, the show gets it right, pointing not only to the ethical dilemma facing doctors, but also the  legal limits  that religious faith poses.  Assault charges have been filed  by JW patients who received blood transfusions. In a 1996 case, the Supreme Court of Connecticut set a precedent in  Stamford Hospital vs. Vega  that a patient’s rights to medical self-determination demands respect for religious beliefs like JWs’. Again, the episode does not go into these details, but it packs in a wealth quick references to the issue’s many facets while focusing on the broader drama that would keep viewers hooked. 
 Grey’s Anatomy has a history of provocative religious references, some approached with glossy simplifications, some problematically wrapped up in neat little bows by the end of the episode, but this compelling storyline was well executed. It even managed to slip in questions about the sincerity of one’s devotion to a family faith and the degree to which people share their religious beliefs with friends. 
 The episode was complicated, but not over the audience’s head; full of perspectives, but still open for viewer interpretation. With viewers having their own variety of religious convictions, that seems like a solid approach. 
 Were you sold on Bad Blood? Did you think it was more one-sided than it should have been? Or maybe it should have been more one-sided? Leave your thoughts in the Comments.

 I did not see the episode but was told about it by a Mormon friend, (I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses). I intend to watch it. However I have experienced 3 major surgeries with blood conservation surgery. I have been hospitalized with anemia and an extremely low blood count and survived with no transfusion. There are many alternatives to a transfusion and in some cases a transfusion even seemingly indicated can do more harm than good. I also take a "blood thinner" daily since I have an artifical heart valve so blood issues are a very real life event for me, not merely an intellectual concept that I may have to deal with sometime. To address the issue of dying for a belief, people are called upon continually to die for a cause and willing to do. Political beliefs have marched millions to the graves. Religious differences have drenched the soils of many nations with blood. So please explain to me why people find it so peculiar that we are willing to die for our religious beliefs? This blood issue is one facet of our beliefs but they are deeply intertwined. For some insight please go to jw.org. For some scientific information on blood go the noblood.org.

 I'm very happy to hear that you have survived these surgeries and that you posted your experience here. Others need to see that more and more doctors are actually preferring to do bloodless surgery since it has less complications. People are willing to die for their country, die for their spouse but they think it is werid to die for God which He is the ONLY one that can resurrect us. What a joke uh?

 i just wanted to add that that we {Jehovah's witnesses} wear pants in the episode all the woman wore skirts, that is another religion that does not wear pants not us. The man praying in the episode also said jesus are lord which is incorrect also. we believe that there is a god whose name is jehovah and jesus which is gods son jesus and god to us are not the same thing they are both different in are religion.

 A Morman should not be considered your friend since not a JW. Blood transfusions are a choice now. I am X-JW. Read the book of Romans and you will then understand more about where our hope lives.

 I appreciate your sentiment regarding a Mormon as a friend. We contintually visit about our respective spiritual beliefs. We see each other once a month for work related issues. During that time we continually have rational discussions regarding society, the inevitabilty of social collapse both from "worldly" point of view as well as a spiritual point of view. Obviously my hope is to have him learn the Truth. So, yes, we do consider each other friends. We have respect for each other and our differing points of view but I focus on what we have in common. I approach it as a Socratic teaching effort, posing himi with questions and trying to put the crumbs before him. We acknowledge our differences religiously but it is also incumbent upon me to maintain a relationship with him as long as he is willing to discuss the issues.

 What about the Watchtower magazine Awake! May 22, 1994, Youths Who Put God First. That magazine cover is plastered with the faces of martyred children. 26 of them. That's just a fraction of those who have died. Your own publications prove you wrong. 
The bible's punishment for not abstaining from blood is to bathe and remain unclean, until sundown (Lev 22) That you can make atonement for it (1 Sam 14:31-35) Only the Watchtower demands human sacrifice.

 You are so wrong. You are trying to manipulate the readers by putting down a random chapter of the Bible. 
Please read Leviticus 17:10,11 : ‘And whatever man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who dwell among you, who eats any blood, I will set My face against that person who eats blood, and will cut him off from among his people. For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that makes atonement for the soul.’ 
That rule was so important that the apostles of the first century were guided by the holy spirit to reinforce it for the Christians: ' For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things: that you abstain from things offered to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well.' (Acts 15:28,29) 
The use of blood was deemed just as serious a sin as sexual immorality. Any rational man will be able to understand whether introducing blood into the body is done by transfusion as it is by consumption.

 I was raised in this church. I left this church. I am a mother of 3 children and would NEVER deny my child EVERY SINGLE OPTION AVAILABLE-INCLUDING blood…should the need arise. I don't believe it is a publishing company's place to legislate these matters. I have friends who, in the name of JW doctrine, have lost loved ones due to their blood policy. Their policies also have a history of waffling/adjustments made in the name of 'New Light.' A JW refusing to accept blood is a way to take a stand for the Watchtower organization. Should a member accept blood, they will become disfellowshipped. I know of a family that did accept blood for their young daughter during her brain surgery. It saved her life. The parents were then 'disfellowshipped.' This action should raise a major red flag: Coercive Belief System. Rewards & Punishments. TOXIC. Believer beware.

 Can it be considered a cult when a cult by definition is devoting yourself to a figure or object that other religions also devote themselves to- God? It is every human beings right to decide hat happens to his or her own body, it is no one else's place to decide that. The problem is society lives in life with ignorance in misunderstood subjects, things they were taught that might not even be true. People should just respect each other. That religion can accept different ways of using blood during surgeries that is their own in cases that blood should be given. In other medical cases to give blood is an easy way out of a situation. There are plenty of hospitals with bloodless programs, that everyone uses not just this religion.

 Humans want to survive the obstacles that nature throws in our way. ALL life seeks survival, which is how evolution occurs. Leave it to religion to have life-seeking humans embracing a death-wish! 
The rest of us want to survive… this weird death wish will die with them eventually, as with most sects. And, although I'm the first to say, what a waste of human potential, the rest of us will be none the worse for it. Just one more irrational belief that got tried and failed, at the cost of human life. 
Seriously, any matter of "faith" that wants to involve something as tangible as blood and human flesh ceases to be about "faith" at all.

 That Greys episode made me so mad, first of all we do not believe it is "Gods Will" whether someone lives or dies and we do not believe that a miracle will save us if something like this happens. I think it is silly to say that no one has or will die from not having a blood transfusion it is very risky but then so is having a blood transfusion, there are hundreds of people that have become sick from having tainted blood. Fortunately science is now so advanced that there are many ways of undergoing surgeries without a blood transfusion and for anyone reading these comments the best place to go to is the official Jehovahs Witness website  http://www.jw.org  which answers all your questions regarding blood rather than listening to some bitter apostate ex Jehovahs Witness. There are serious legitimate bible based reasons why we would do something involving ours and our children's lives it is not something that we take lightly.

 Jules, you sound like a well-trained JW. Answering with their cookie-cutter response. I know this cause half of my family are lost in the elder, MS, pioneer fantasy. 
 As for me, I am an ex-JW (not bitter, but quite happy, much more so than my JW family members). I also work in a pediatric ICU and as a trained Extracoporeal Cardiac Life Support specialist. Yeah, the ones that run all of a patient's blood outside their body and and clean it and add more blood and put it back in. 
 In your and my family and the 8 guys in NYC I am committing a grave sin. I will be obliterated in your Armageddon. But in real life, we are saving babies, children, teens. We are giving them a chance to exercise their own free will. Unlike what you and the JW organization is doing. 
 I get to go home and feel a profound happiness and peace knowing I helped save a life. Much more altruistic than say, thinking you are serving humanity by making sure the 8 guys in NYC know how many hours of service you put in this month? 
 So much "new light" (aka "oops, we messed up) in the organization. How will you feel when the "oops, we messed up on the whole blood thing" new light comes out? Cause darling, it will.

 People get lost in egotism and self-righteousness, that’s the problem with society. The fact that people care so much about other people’s business, it’s their own bodies and they should be able to choose whatever they want to happen to them to be honest. Do you go around telling a Mormon it is stupid they think they can’t drink coffee because of the caffeine? They don’t want to do it; it’s their choice. IF a person feels guilt his or her life for doing something they don’t believe is right and regret, in this case accepting blood when there are other alternatives in many cases- then person moves on with not doing what they know they will regret. People die everyday, in many different ways. We will all die eventually anyway, we cannot choose how someone else lives his or her life because in the end it is not your life. Just my opinion I guess.

 I think if this issue is to be taken seriously, then they need the portrayal of the family to be much more realistic! Anyone who knows a Jehovah's Witness knows they don't speak, act, or look like that. I know quite a few and have some in my extended family, and they don't go around saying things like "it's God's Will" or "Blessed Be" <- they're not Wiccan! lol. And what was with the dress/make-up!! The ones I know look way more modern than that. Anyway.. just my thoughts. I know it's a serious issue, but then present it in the way it really is.. not in a way that is trying to make one side look nutty.  shrug

 I'm one of JWs. I watched the episode and thought, in general, it was fairly ok. It left a lot of unanswered questions and there were quite a few inaccuracies, some of which have already been pointed out in comments here by others. But for those that are bothered, we don't carry dog-tags that say "Jehovah's Witness" on them, instead we carry a card that we keep with us (in wallet, purse etc) that says "No Blood" on it and unfolds to reveal a detailed legal document that we fully understand, have customised in line with our conscience and have signed (with a witness present) that specifies treatments that we do and do not accept. Also, we wouldn't stand around in the waiting area publicly praying out loud drawing attention to ourselves. The family would definitely be praying both individually (in their heads) and collectively in a quiet discreet way, most probably out of view. They would not necessarily be praying for a physical miracle from God, but they would likely be asking for the mental strength to endure the situation and for guidance to make the difficult but correct decisions in the given situation. If anyone wants to know more, please go directly to JW.org. I'd urge you not to bother with any of the other sites listed here. If I were an ex-JW I don't think that I'd bother to spend my free time slandering the JW's, let alone go out of my way to create websites and post derogatory comments about them but unfortunately that's what most of these other sites are (and people call us wierdos).

 I wish there was a way to like your comment. I am also a JW. I will say at first the episode did upset me with how the portrayl was inaccurate. It also annoys me to come here and read things from "ex witnesses" they say some of the most hurtful things. It does come off as very bitter and its extremely offensive. I find it very interesting how very few question young people putting there lives in danger to fight in wars, but we're extremist or into some kind of cult because we'd die for our religion. Strange….

 you also don't ask a victim of brainwashing to repeat the information they have been "taught" and expect it to be truthful. Or……. Go to their crazy brainwashing gatherings or websites to hear something "factual" 
 This episode was very well done, it actually did demonstrate the thinking, appearance and actions of religious members of this organization very well. They view themselves as set apart from everyone else and if you have ever seen one of their many "dramas" they like to create at their yearly conventions the term "praise be" pretty mich shows up in all of them. 
 As for why ex-jw's or "apostates" (such a funny little word that they think has some TERRIBLE meaning and makes us all tremble in our boots) feel the need to comment on the silliness or patheticness of the beleifs…….. Its because we actually have more experience in the field of knowledge of Jehovahs Witnesses than actual current JW's do. Because we have been on both sides, we see both sides. We can identify and understand why a JW might do something or not AND see the reality of why that decision is crazy or not. 
 "Would you go to a hair dresser to learn about medicine? " i would if he or she had been trained and was a doctor but decided to go a different path……. As opposed to going to a medical student that is so engrossed in medical school and so almighty in their thinking about themselves that they likely have no original thought of their own and instead can only quote from a medical book. 
 Yeah……. I would rather go to the person who has had the experience and decided it wasn't for them, they may be partial on their own feelings towards "medicine" but at least they're not a brainwashed med student.

 I'm a witness and my husband is disfellowshipped, and he's not as salty as you always hear other people are. You choose not to go back or you choose to leave, that's no one's fault it was a choice. He's not angry or lying about things that did or did not happen to him or his family. In fact he has a lot of good memories, he just chooses not to go to meetings anymore. He still believes in what he was taught, he's not ignorant or angry throwing hateful words at me or his family because of his choice. If you don't go back then just live your life, do you not think that any person who leaves a religion might disagree with some teachings, that's why they leave. I know plenty of people I work with who used to be catholic but refuse to continue going because of not having been married in the church, not haven green baptized, etc. who cannot take their communion because of it. I have a cousin who used to practice islam, and she left it for reasons she ended up deciding she disagreed with. People leave a religion for a reason, disagreeing with a teaching. Everyone has their own opinions, but that doesn't make it factual. Often, people who used to be witnesses come off sounding very much like liberals do in politics "I'm right and you're wrong without proof." All because of emotions over powering logic.

 Have you had a transfusion? Do you know what it feels like? It does not always end well, you can feel negative effects. Feeling sick, feeling exhausted, and the transfusion does not always work. When there are alternatives, it seems that to accept blood because it is a common or say choice, does not seem like always the best choice. Personal experience.

Just because we are a conservative religion does not mean we have no style or sense of fashion. Second, we do not pray to the Lord Jesus, we pray in Jesus name, but we pray directly to Jehovah our God. And he's not just our God, he is God. We do not believe in the Trinity. This may seem like a small mistake, but to us this would be as big of a deal as someone depicting a born-again Christian who believes in creation as being a born-again Christian who believes in evolution. Our belief that God Jesus and the Holy Spirit are three separate entities as one of the cornerstones of our faith, and it is one that sets us apart from most other Christian religions, not to mention it is one of the facets of my religion that I hold very dear as it is very logical and easy to explain and understand. Third, the boy depicted in this episode looked to be in his mid to late teens, giving viewers the idea that he was old enough to make his own decisions about religion. The show goes on to explain how this boy never even mentioned to one of his best friends that he was a Jehovah's Witness, leading the view were to conclude that he did not share his parents believes. The show also failed to mention whether or not this teenager it was baptized. These are very important matters that should have been made clear in order to convey the real sentiment behind being one of Jehovah's Witnesses. This teenager had longer hair, which does not go with scriptural council that is given regarding dress and grooming, In regards to males. Also, if this boy was as rebellious against his parents religious beliefs as he appears to be in the show, (please remember to make note of the longer hair, and his not mentioning to his friends that he is a witness) then it is very questionable as to whether or not he would actually be wearing a necklace ( which by the way this is not something that I have ever seen another Jehovah's Witness wear in my life- and I have been one for over 30 years) that states he is one of Jehovah's Witnesses, when all outside indicators show that he is not baptized. Of course, if he is under the age of 18 and was not conscious, his parents retain the right to choose any type of medical care that they want, or do not want, for their son. I found it interesting though, that a show as advanced as Grey's Anatomy did not even discuss how bloodless surgery is considered to be the gold standard among surgeons. This should have been a surgery that Christina Yang would have thrived at wanting to perform as it shows the excellence of the surgeon to be able to do so without using a blood transfusion. Also, it was incorrect that the doctors were stating that they could take his blood out and then put it back into his body, as this is not a process that Jehovah's Witnesses allow either. If you're going to tackle an issue such as blood transfusions and Jehovah's Witnesses, it would do the director of the show as well as the creator and writer of the show, to do their research on our website at  http://www.jw.org  and find out exactly what we do and do not allow when it comes to blood, blood expanders, and other medical treatments that do not directly involve blood. One interesting fact, is that it is up to each and every individual baptized Jehovah's Witness to decide exactly what their conscience will and will not allow when it comes to blood expanders and the like. This is something that has never been addressed and any medical show that talks about Jehovah's Witnesses. I have found that in shows ranging from ER to scrubs, it never deals with this very important fact, it is up to every Jehovah's Witnesses conscience to decide what type of care they are comfortable with receiving. Also, I note to the author of this article, we are not a sect. Please get out your dictionary and look up the meaning of the word. We are a religion. We are not a branch off of any other religion, We are Jehovah's Witnesses, and that is a recognized religion in this country, at least for the time being.

 Found this online- it was done in 2005. Since Grey's Anatomy is supposed to be a Cutting Edge medical show, I was surprised that this was not more along the lines of the storyline they went with. Also, Jehovah's Witnesses do not require that all women wear skirts or look like crap and dress in earthtone colors. Also, we are not a sect, and we do not believe that Jesus and God are the same, therefore when we pray, we pray to Jehovah God, not directly to Jesus, we pray in Jesus name. Also, this boy clearly was not a Jehovah's Witness, and he would never be wearing a medical necklace that states that he was one when he clearly does not practice these beliefs. He would have gotten the blood transfusion, and his parents would've been upset about it, but there would've been nothing they could have done because it was an emergency, and he would not be wearing a medical ID tag that states he's a Jehovah's Witness.

 This patient was not a kid, this "kid" was 19 years old. Which means he is old enough to make his own medical decisions. The fact that he has long hair, and did not tell any of his friends that he is a Jehovah's Witness, would lead me, as one of Jehovah's Witnesses, to believe that he in fact is NOT a baptized Jehovah's Witness. Therefore, he would never in his right mind be wearing a necklace that states that he is one of Jehovah's Witnesses when he clearly IS NOT. They really need to get their facts straight about us before they make up stories about us.

 OK, sorry to add more but now I'm watching more of the episode and it's even worse than I thought! A Jehovah's Witness would never state that their son would live if it was God's will through the miracle of prayer. That's such a load of crap. We are not religious fanatics, we are well aware of the fact that sometimes bad things happen to good people. It has nothing whatsoever to do with God or his will. Also, a man who is a Jehovah's Witness would never state that their son would be condemned if he had a blood transfusion, when it's very apparent that this 19-year-old is not a Jehovah's Witness! My father actually received a blood transfusion without knowing it, and without his consent- and he and I and my mother and everyone else who knows him fully believe that God is not going to judge him for something that he had no control over.

 "BAD BLOOD ^ MADE GREY'S ANATOMY LOOK LIKE IDIOTS. THEY NEED TO DO BETTER RESEARCH ON BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS. THERE ARE MANY HOSPITALS THAT ARE GOING WITH NO BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS BECAUSE THEY FOUND OUT ITS BETTER AND THE PATIENTS HEALS BETTER. THEY ARE NOT VERY GOOD DOCTORS IF THEY COULDN"t DO RESEARCH ON THE MATTER TO FIND A BETTER WAY.
