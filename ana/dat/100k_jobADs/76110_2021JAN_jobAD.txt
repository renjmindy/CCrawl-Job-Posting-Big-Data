 About Rally 
 Rally is a video conferencing platform enabling multiple conversations in parallel. You no longer have to take turns to speak, and can hop in and out of conversations with a click. This is perfect for happy hours, networking, and other social gatherings. We are being used by institutions like MasterCard, Harvard and a multitude of startups across North America.

 About the role 
 We are looking for a talented UI/UX Designer who can design beautiful interfaces that inspire a feeling or warmth and connection. Rally is a real-time multiplayer experience with lots of intricate functionalities and configurable options - it's a very challenging design problem. The UX and UI in video hasn't changed much in the past 20-30 years and we believe now is the time (See links below to what we mean). 
 You'll be working very closely with the founders, early engineers, customers, and will be a major contributor to the voice and direction of the company. Let's make it happen! 🎉 
 Some roles and responsibilities: 
 
 Plan and implement new designs (We use Figma!) 
 Optimize existing user interface designs 
 Test for intuitively and experience 
 Communicate with clients to understand their business goals and objectives 
 Develop technical and business requirements and always strive to deliver intuitive and user-centered solutions 
 Combine creativity with an awareness of the design elements 
 Create prototypes for new product ideas 
 Test new ideas before implementing 
 Conduct an ongoing user research 
 
 Key requirement: Must be a fan of emojis! 🙏😏

 Rally is in some ways more like a realtime multiplayer video game than it is like a typical web application. We are streaming multiple video and audio streams, and must optimize CPU usage and framerate. We are managing real-time state and behavioural rules in a central "game" server, and firing off events to large numbers of clients in real-time. Lots of tough and interesting technical challenges to solve - not just another CRUD app 😀. Come join us in our quest to bring the energy back into online gatherings! 🙌
