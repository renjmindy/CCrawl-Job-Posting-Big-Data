  4 Ways To Keep Your Job Search Under Wraps  
 Annette Richmond 
 September 26, 2016 
 Looking for a job when you're unemployed is tough. On the plus side, you have plenty of time to interview. The negative side is that many employers prefer to hire candidates who are already employed.  RELATED: 4 Tips To Help You Shorten Your Job Search  Despite the advantage of being more attractive to potential employers, looking for a job while holding down a full-time job has another set of problems. The main challenge is making sure your current boss doesn't find out. But there are a few ways to keep your job search confidential. 
 
 Attire Upgrade **** 
 Give your work wardrobe a face-lift before you start looking for a new opportunity. If you work in a very laid-back environment, swap casual slacks for jeans a couple of days a week. Wear a jacket once in a while, even if you keep it on the back of your chair most of the day. That way when you do come to the office dressed for a job interview no one will be the wiser. 
 Don't Attract Attention 
 Turn off your activity broadcasts on LinkedIn before you begin your job search too. Most candidates spruce up their LinkedIn profile when they're looking for a new job. Adding jobs. Adding skills. Finally getting around to writing that Summary. But, a flurry of activity on your LinkedIn profile is a signal that you are looking for a new opportunity. So be sure to go to your “Privacy & Settings" page and “Turn off your activity broadcasts" under “Privacy Controls." 
 Not At The Office 
 Don't use your company computer for your job search. Many companies monitor employee activity, and you certainly don't want your employer reading emails you've exchanged with recruiters. Or going through your search history and find that you've been visiting job sites or researching resume writers. While you may get away with receiving job-search related calls at your office, using your personal cell phone may save some explaining down the line. 
 Keep Quiet 
 Keep your job search close to the vest. Be careful who you tell. Not only might your colleague inadvertently let your secret slip it may change his or her opinion of you. You may be considered disloyal. Also, avoid complaining about your current job or talking about looking for a new one on social media. You never know who will see your post or take a screenshot and pass it on to your current employer. Candidates who are already employed are more attractive to employers. The trick is to keep your job search under wraps, so you stay that way. But, with a little preparation and planning you can make sure your boss will be surprised when it's time to say goodbye.
