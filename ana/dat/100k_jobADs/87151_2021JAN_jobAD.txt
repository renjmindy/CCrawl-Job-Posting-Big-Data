 Careers at UP Health System 
 We bring the highest quality care and services to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. UP Health System combines the experience and services of two community hospitals, Bell and Portage, with the tertiary care of Marquette, a Duke LifePoint hospital. From our partnership with Northern Michigan University in forming the Upper Michigan Brain Tumor Center and research lab, to our Heart & Vascular team's introduction of the TAVR procedure to the Upper Peninsula in 2015, UP Health System is on the cutting-edge of technology and patient care.
