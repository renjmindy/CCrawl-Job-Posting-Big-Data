The Bottom of a Bottle 
 Trust me, I've been there, I've looked, I've searched and I know now, that there are no answers to be found in the bottom of a bottle or on the edge of a blade! Fighting Hard, Recovering, Rebuilding, REBORN. Moving on from addiction to a new life.

 As Quick As Time Passes – Job 11:18 
 As quick as time passes 
 Hope builds a way 
 All mistakes of a life 
 Grace will wipe away 
 If time erases the will 
 Hope and grace build a future 
 Turning the lostness of our thoughts 
 To a secure future in the Lord 
 
 Job 11:18
