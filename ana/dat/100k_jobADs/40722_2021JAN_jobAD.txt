 WorkPac and Jobtrail are runners up at the 2018 Queensland Resources Council Indigenous Awards 
 29/05/2018BY: Tracey Mesken 
 WorkPac runners up for the ‘Best Company Indigenous Employment and Training Initiative Award’ at this year’s Queensland Resources Council Indigenous Awards. 
 Australia’s largest privately-owned recruitment company WorkPac were honoured to attend the Queensland Resources Council (QRC) Indigenous Awards, held during reconciliation week on the 28th of May, as finalists for the ‘Best Company Indigenous Employment and Training Initiative Award’. 
 The award is for those who have developed programs or strategies that boost attraction and retention of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander’s to the resources sector. 
 WorkPac’s nomination for the award was for ‘Murri’s in the Mines’, an initiative which places Indigenous WorkPac employees in traineeships across Australia as a means of starting their careers in mining, and is run by WorkPac’s Indigenous division JobTrail 
 JobTrail began its development in 2015 following meetings with WorkPac’s Founder and Chairman Phil Smart and his longtime friend Albert Bowie, with an aim of increasing the company’s investment and contribution to Indigenous employment and training in Australia. Officially launching in November 2016, the ‘Murri’s in the Mines’ initiative has been a focal point of JobTrail’s work. 
 Although they did not win on the evening, JobTrail’s National Manager Julian Genn is proud of the nomination and of what they have achieved so far. 
 “The work of all the finalists in this category is exceptional, so to have come runners up is an honour in and of itself”. 
 “This has shown us that we are on the right track with this program and given us renewed energy and focus as we continue to grow and develop ‘Murri’s in the Mines’ through 2018 and beyond” he said. 
 Mr. Genn also congratulated Downer Mining, who won for their Indigenous Work Readiness Recruitment and Training Program run in partnership with Blackwater PCYC. 
 “I’d like to congratulate Downer and our friends at the PCYC on their win, and on their continued progress in furthering the growth of Indigenous employment in the resources sector”.
