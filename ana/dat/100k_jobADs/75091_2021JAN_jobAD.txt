 Agent Extra is a lead generation & prospecting business 100% dedicated to winning new business for independent estate agents across the UK. 
 It's a massive market in terms of clients and we are the only company that provides the service we do - offering a truly unique service. We're entering our 5th year in business and we are already the number 1 most effective way for estate agents to generate new appointments and we can prove it. 
 What we are looking for is an exceptional sales person to come in and join our core sales team. We are the best sales people in the industry bar none and that is why our clients use us - our drive, hunger and determination to perform for them each month - can you relate to this kind of attitude? All I care about is your personality, if you are hungry, driven and a bit different I want to hear from you. There is no one else doing what Agent Extra does which makes 2020 a very exciting time for us - we are self funded with ambitions to be the go-to company to win new business for estate agents in the UK. 
 This is a work from home role which involves you handeling leads from local homeowners on behalf of our clients and indentifying those who have properties to sell or let now or in the future - we are not your 'textbook' startup - it's quality over quantity at Agent Extra - All leads and training provided. Get in touch if you'd like to know why and tell me something about yourself.
