 The Value of a Career Coach 
 
 Make sure you have someone in your life from whom you can get reflective feedback." 
Warren G Bennis, President of the University of Cincinnati 
 
 There can be only one reason for not having a coach; not being able to afford one. It would, of course, be nonsensical to assume everyone has available cash to pay for a coach, career or otherwise. To a large extent, the role of coach is the basis for this website. Naturally, if any of our members wants additional, personal support it is available. 
 So, what areas can a coach participate? 
 
 Providing a fresh pair of eyes 
 Eliciting your sense of purpose and personal philosophy 
 Opening up an understanding of true aspirations 
 Investigating the value and merits of the current situation 
 Identifying the correct general direction 
 Creating the career path, possibly in the current organisation 
 Bringing clarity to the exercise 
 Helping to create deep focus and concentration 
 Developing personal confidence 
 Identifying areas for personal development and learning 
 Ensuring proper preparation (to prevent poor performance) PPPPP 
 Considering all aspects of selection, including interviews and assessments 
 
 Deciding whether to use a coach and how to use him or her, means investing in yourself. The key word is investing. Yes it costs money but the payback, both financially and emotionally, may be great if you fully participate.
