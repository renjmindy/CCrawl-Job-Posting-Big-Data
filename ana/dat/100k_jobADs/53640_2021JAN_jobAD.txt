 Career Description 
 Install, maintain or repair electric lines, regulators, transformers, and switches. Being a line-person is serious work. Safety is a priority and you must work well in a team! You should be prepared to work outside no matter the weather and (possibly) have to work some nights during storms or major outages. Many linemen get to travel to other parts of the country to help communities devastated by hurricanes or major storms. 
 What's next? 
 Being an Electrical Lineperson requires a certificate. Both  Caldwell Community College and Technical Institute  and  Cleveland Community College  have programs that are affordable and take less than 3-4 months to complete.
