 I Level Capped my Money Making Job! Now I'm poor. 
 Mar 2 
 Posted by  Corelin 
 So my miner hit 50! Always a good time in FF XIV. Now I have access to high level crafting mats. I can efficiently farm crystals and in-demand materials to buff my wallet. AND I'M OVER A MILLION GIL POORER AND MIGHT PAY MORE THAN 4 MILLION TO MAX IT OUT. 
 Yeah. I'm POOR. I mean incredibly poor. I'm nowhere NEAR first to market of course, and I can't gather the absolute top end gear. I'm making money at an acceptable rate, I could probably clear a couple hundred thousand on a work night and I don't doubt I could clear a million on a GOOD weekend binge. Between the ventures I can complete and the unspoiled nodes as well as crystal grinding or finding key materials to farm I am quite sure I can make a lot of money out there but WOW is it pricey. 
 Right now we are a month or so out from the 2.55 or whatever patch which will probably be the last content patch before Heavesward. Heavensward will render all my gear useless and require me to start over. That being said it's not the worst money grind I've ever had and it's certainly a different sort of engagement in gameplay style. 
 Money isn't a huge deal in FF XIV. There's not a lot of things you need to buy and it seems like accumulating it to buy vanity gear or to fill in key pieces (or help level an alt) is the big priority. I will keep grinding money and try to figure out the best ways and places to spend it when the expansion drops but it will be interesting to see how fast I can make money and how worthwhile it is to upgrade gear I will be dropping in three months or less.
