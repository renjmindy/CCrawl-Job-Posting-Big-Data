 Jobs That Let You Travel Internationally 
 April 4, 2018 by  Eric Cantu   58 Comments 
 Do you have wanderlust like I do?  (I’m pretty much a travel addict ) . Do you look on Instagram at these young people spending months at a time traveling all over the world and wonder how in the world they’re doing what they’re doing? It’s all about knowing how to find jobs that let you travel internationally. 
 Finding jobs that you travel for is easier than you think. Some traveling jobs require no degree & no experience! There are actually entry level jobs that require travel! 
 I’m not going to list jobs that take a decade of schooling and training to get. This is a list of 6  realistic  jobs that you can travel with.

 Are you ready to put that passport to use? Stop what you’re doing because this article is going to show you 6 great options for working abroad and how easy or difficult they are to land. 
 6 Jobs That Let You Travel Internationally & How to Land Them 
 Watch this video listing 6 great jobs you can work while you travel the world. I’ll show you how easy or hard they are to land, if they pay well, what you’d be doing, along with some resources for researching further.  Which one of these has your name written all over it? 
 
 
 1. English Teacher Abroad 
 
 
 Ease of attaining: Not difficult, but may take time for some 
Pay: $2000 – $3000 per month 
 One of the most popular and sought after jobs that you can travel with is being a professional English teacher. English teachers are very sought after all over the world. 
 And you don’t have to be a Shakespearean expert in the language either. A basic knowledge and understanding plus a couple of credentials along with a college degree can be all you need. 
 You speaky the English? Yes? You’re hired! 
 You think I’m joking? Surprisingly, as related by one of my readers in the comments section below this article, his interview basically took as long as that sentence took to type: 
 
 You speaky the English was more or less all I had to listen to at an interview with Thai school staff. Being presentably dressed and well mannered also help a great deal. They’re not keen on teachers with tattoos here, so if you have any, keep them covered up.” 
 –  (read the original comment left by James in the comments section below the post) . 
 
 As I mentioned, you do need a college degree and a  TEFL  certification  (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) . But if you can acquire those and are ready to travel, the pay isn’t bad. 
 You normally even get your accommodations taken care of, too. 
 While the TEFL isn’t too hard to get, the degree will take time if you don’t have one already. Hit the books for a couple of years and enjoy very rewarding career and the travel that comes with it. 
 
 2. Flight Attendant 
 
 
 Ease of attaining: Training & lots of patience needed 
Pay: $1000 – $4000 per month 
 I’ve been on many, many, many flights.  I have to admit though, I’ve never seen the life of a flight attendant as glamorous. This may be because of all my years as a firefighter dealing with people calling 911.  Customer service isn’t always fun. 
 But you know what is? 
 Constantly flying around the world, checking out the nightlife in seemingly limitless cities, taking in all the different cultures,  free travel for you and your family,  and of course, the view from working above the clouds! 
 Did I mention the  free travel?  I did? Ok good. 
 All those perks are needed because customer service in a confined space with cranky passengers can be VERY difficult. The training can be grueling, the hours are sometimes long  (16 hour flight to australia anyone?)  , and you’ll have to get used to skyping your loved ones. 
 But hey, when it comes to jobs that you can travel with, the perks that come with this job are hard to beat and may just outweigh dealing with the woman throwing a childlike tantrum in seat 16C because you’re all out of ginger ale. 
 
 3. Work as an Au Pair 
 
 
 Ease of attaining: Not too hard, must love kids 
Pay: $400 – $1000 per month 
 This is another very popular one, especially among young, female wanderlusters. 
 An au pair is a live-in babysitter. To be an au pair you’ll probably need mastery of a second language since you’ll be communicating with your host family and their kids constantly. 
 (You should probably really love children too.) 
 Being an au pair has a dash of English teacher sprinkled in with it. Besides your basic household chores, you’ll also be helping teach the kids a new language. 
 Kids are sponges when it comes to language. (Try not to cuss around them. When they start sharing their newly learned English cuss words with their parents, you’ll have some explaining to do.) 
 In return for your duties, you get room, board, and a modest income. Also, you get to live in a foreign country and truly experience a new culture up close and personal.  Can you say “total immersion”? 
 Don’t expect to have too much free time though. Kids do need lots and lots and lots of attention. But this also makes for a very rewarding job. 
 (Unless they’re brats). 
 
 4. Bartender 
 
 Ease of attaining: Pretty easy 
Pay: $1000 – $4000 per month 
 Now we’re talking.  You know what’s one of the best things about working in the bar industry? The job description is just about the same everywhere you go! 
 Bars, restaurants, and nightclubs all have a proven formula when it comes to bartending. Be attentive, be social, and most importantly make really good drinks! I’m always partial to a bartender who smiles, but I’ll take a stone faced bartender who knows what they’re doing and never leaves me waiting without a drink in a heartbeat. 
 Wherever you’re working, it’ll be helpful to know the basics in the native language. Although when I’ve partied abroad, I’ve found that everyone seems to magically understand each other when alcohol is in the mix.  Funny how that works. 
 But to avoid insulting your patrons, take a cram course in the native language. You’ll pick up the rest as you go. 
 The more experience you gain bartending, the more opportunities will open up with a potential for higher pay. And who wouldn’t love to say they bartended all across the globe? 
 No matter what age you are, if you’re serious about working abroad and don’t mind working for someone else and working lots of crazy nights, bartending abroad may be for you. 
 
 5. Work on a Cruise Ship or Private Yacht 
 
 
 Ease of attaining: Not too hard, but patience is a must 
Pay: $2000 – $3000 per month 
 Working on a large cruise ship or private yacht may seem like a spectacular way to see the world, but there’s definitely work involved.  Anyone else binge watched a whole season of Below Deck on an easy Sunday? 
 In general, to succeed in this field you’ll need to be fast, attentive, and always have a “the customer is always right” attitude. This is similar to the attitude needed if you’re a flight attendant. Again,  customer service isn’t easy. 
 Some great perks are that your food, accommodation, transportation, and even insurance are covered while working on most cruise ships. Further, many also provide vacation time so you can travel on your own. 
 There are also a boatload (see what I did there?) of different types of positions available. As a result, you could work as a deck-hand, stewardess, chef, paramedic, entertainment manager, entertainment staff, engineer, and many more. 
 
 6. Affiliate Marketer 
 
 
 Ease of attaining: Must be self-driven with focus 
Pay: With the right training there’s no ceiling to what you’ll earn 
 While working for someone else is the norm, working for yourself can be much, much more rewarding.  Being your own boss  can be a huge game changer when it comes to traveling abroad. 
 Forget taking care of kids and teaching English, sign me up! 
 Of course, when you’re your own boss, there’s no one to make sure things get done but you. For this reason you’ll need to be self motivated and driven. This is where having an entrepreneurial mindset can take you far. 
 So what kind of business can you build without products or services of your own and a mindset to succeed? Say hello to  affiliate marketing. 
 Affiliate marketing  is all about connecting people with what they’re already looking for. If you’ve ever bought anything online or read a review that lead you to buy something from Amazon, Best Buy, Target, or any number of trusted merchants online, then you’ve participated in affiliate marketing without even realizing it. 
 Further, you can create your affiliate marketing business  in any niche you choose.  Build an online business around your passion and you may never feel like you’re working. 
 Whether you’re a photographer who’d love to  sell your photos online , a freelance writer, travel blogger, fitness enthusiast, yoga instructor, chef, personal coach, video gamer, or  anything  really, this is a great option. 
 
 Final Thoughts 
 You have to be flexible if you’re looking for a job that lets you travel. All 6 options above are clear proof of that. You have to be self-motivated, a bit adventurous, and able to be out on your own away from your comfort zone. 
 But isn’t that what wanderlust is all about?  **** And if you’re looking for jobs that you travel with, then those kinds of characteristics should already be burned into your persona. 
 Whether you want to hustle in a flying tube at 30,000 ft, slang drinks to foreign diplomats at a swanky club, or be your own boss working from your laptop  (see what I did there?)  , your options are there for the taking. 
 If the affiliate marketing route is one that interests you,  check out my top recommendation here.  The training is thorough, and I’ve had nothing but positive experiences with it.

 Some really cool suggestions there. I remember a few months back I got offered a chance to play bass in a function band on the cruise ships. I really wanted to go and see the world and earn whilst doing it but sadly the thought of being on the ship between 6 weeks – 4 months at a time and being away from my family was just too hard a choice to make. I have started my journey on affiliate marketing and I’m absolutely loving it!

 I have always wanted to become a flight attendant because they get to travel overseas and are able to go to a lot of countries but I am a little scared because they always end up flying almost everyday. A pretty awesome job with really good pay. And as you mentioned I don’t really think they require university degree to get it. 
 I do also like the idea of affiliate marketing as it gives you the opportunity to work anywhere at anytime around the world.

 I work in the I.T industry as a software developer and although I love my job, one of the biggest downsides of it is that I don’t get to travel internationally as most of what I do can be handled remotely. However, this post has been quite informative on this but topic I’m surprised to learn that affiliate marketing gives one the opportunity to travel to another country. I’ll look more into this and see if I can capitalize on it.

 Hey really good article! Both bartending and affiliate marketing catch my interest right away. Bartending for obvious reasons, just like you said, but also affiliate marketing to be able to have freedom! How long have you been doing this? Did you get 100% of your training from the platform you mention? Thanks!

 Great questions! Yes sir I was a complete newbie when I started my training with Wealthy Affiliate. I had no background at all in building websites and had no idea what affiliate marketing was. The training absolutely delivers. I’m proud to say that I was able to have a  $4k month in my first year , and that was huge for me. I highly recommend checking it out for yourself through any of my links above 🙂

 Ive done most of these jobs. I have worked as a flight attendant, english teacher, bart tender but not au pair or cruise ship. I know that the people on cruise ships work very long hours and rarely get a chance to leave the ship to visit the places they dock. The best is affiliate marketing as you always a learning new skills and topics and you can be your own boss.

 Hi Eric 
 It’s a pleasure to hear from another Eric haha! This is very inspiring! I’m also an addict when it comes to traveling. When I was working a regular job, I didn’t have the freedom nor time to travel whenever I please. Internet Marketing has opened new doors for myself and for my family. 
 I didn’t know this kind of lifestyle exist, but it didn’t come with finding the magic bullet. It required hard work and sacrifices. It all started with discovering your recommended platform. 
 Thanks Eric, 
Eric

 Hi Eric! I read your article and my mind is going nuts thinking of all the possibilities! lol. 
 These six jobs that you have listed as travel jobs are great because you have such a spectrum to choose from. I’m not someone with a degree, so teaching English may have to be put on the back burner. But between working on an airline, a cruise ship, or being my own boss, I feel like this could actually be a reality. 
 I’m giddy! lol

 Thanks for the great comment! I can feel your excitement through your words! Any one of these jobs would be a great way to travel the world, but of course what worked for me is the affiliate marketing route. It takes time, but the training absolutely delivers. In my case  I had a $4k month 11 months in.  I tell everyone to think of it like this: if you had the opportunity to get trained with something that less than a year from now could be earning you thousands more per month, wouldn’t you jump at that opportunity? 
 If that’s the route you go through I really look forward to helping you in every way I can.  Create your free starter account from any of the links here in this article  and I hope to see you on the inside!

 Hi Eric! 
 I loved how you segued into affiliate marketing at the end there! Smooth! But true! 
 I’m familiar about the perks of being an English teacher overseas, being a flight attendant, and being on cruise ships because I know of people who have done those jobs and they are very rewarding. One interesting fact, you can work for any airline in any capacity and you still get the same travel benefits as flight attendants! I know. My wife worked for Air France once and for as long as she did, our flights were free. 
 But having your own business online is the best because you answer to no one but yourself. And you can take care of business anywhere there is WiFi connection! 
 This was a wonderful article filled with a lot of useful information. Thank you for sharing! Great job, and good luck!

 Hi, Eric. This is definitely a great list. Many of these are great for someone who is single, like a flight attendant or cruise ship worker. I couldn’t imagine being away from my family for that amount of time, though. Now the building an online business idea I can really get behind. That way, you can take your family with you, and as long as you have an Internet connection, you’re set.

 As an English teacher for 14 years in Thailand (with no TEFL or other qualifications) I can add that in some countries it is very easy to get a job as an English teacher. 
 You speaky the English was more or less all I had to listen to at an interview with Thai school staff. Being presentably dressed and well mannered also help a great deal. They’re not keen on teachers with tattoos here, so if you have any, keep them covered up. I’m okay though, not one tattoo blemishes my lovely English skin…lol

 Great list of jobs you provided Eric. I like the idea of a laptop lifestyle that really suits me rather than being on a schedule like the other ones you talked about. When I was really young living in a youth hostel at a ski resort town, they were almost begging us to come work on the hill. You can really travel for cheap doing it this way. What is your favourite job to do travelling? Thanks for this, Really well done.

 Hi Eric! 
These are great suggestions! I have considered many of them myself at one point or another. I have definitely looked into being a flight attendant and working on a cruise ship and they are both excellent choices! Someday I hope to be able to work remotely from my laptop no matter where in the world I am (like on a beach), while still making enough money to travel freely. That’s the dream! Thanks for sharing this wonderfully inspiring article. These are some awesome ideas!

 Hi Eric, 
Thanks for your post. To be honest with you, I ‘m been traveling for the better part of last 6 years and actually looking to return home. However, once I settled down, I would like to travel again. Your list of jobs are very attainable for most, and that meant you were very considerate for most people who may be interested in traveling. However, there should be good opportunities for professionals aboard too. For example, what about medical and legal professionals. I’m sure their services could be valuable. Me personally, I like to be a portfolio manager, looking to find hidden investment value in emerging markets. Cheers.

 Absolutely. You’re right about the medical field having travel perks. Travel nursing is another really popular travel job with great benefits as well.

 Interesting post, nicely put together, thanks. 
One downside of the cruise ship is the “no fraternising with the guests” rule, which means that all those lovely rich widows are off limits. 
One advantage of the teacher abroad is that in many Asian countries, teachers are treated with respect by the students. This is a concept that many western teachers find hard to grasp …

 Haha. Those dang cruise rules! That made me laugh Derek. And yes, respect for teachers is now a completely foreign concept. How times have changed.

 Derek, when I first came to Australia I traveled via P&O. Our dinner partners were two older gentlemen (70s). At first we were doubtful about this. By the end of the line voyage all the other young people had wrangled their way over to our section. They said they couldn’t stand not knowing what we were continually laughing about. 
 One of our jobs was to warn the gentlemen of incoming widows! Or waylaying them on their advance. It was a wonderful trip.

 Performers are some of the most well traveled in the world. Take advantage of that and go! Build yourself a site online and share your music. Make me jealous lol

 Hi Eric, 
 Great post man! I have done the bartending thing overseas and loved it! Meeting amazing people and basically a non stop party haha! I also did the TEFL course years ago when you didn’t need a degree but I failed to follow through on that one. 
 I am now on the Wealthy Affiliate train and my dreams of travelling the world are slowly taking shape 🙂 
 Thanks for a fun post and bringing back memories 🙂 
 Kev
