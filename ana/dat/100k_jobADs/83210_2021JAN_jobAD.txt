 Paytient 
 
 Overview 
 Paytient is on a mission to help people live better lives by improving their ability to better access and afford care. 
 Our financial technology gives Americans the funds they need to pay for the more than $400 Billion in out-of-pocket healthcare expenses (e.g., spending within deductibles, co-pays, co-insurance) that were billed last year. 
 For too long, there has been too much preventable financial harm and delayed or deferred care hurting patients and providers. We envision a fairer future, over the horizon, where every American can more easily pay for care and live a financially healthier life. 
 Founded in 2018, Paytient has raised $50 million from CoVenture and $7M from Inspired Capital, Lightbank, BoxGroup, Cultivation Capital, Crossbeam, and Lachy Groom Fund to fuel our mission and help employers, payors, providers, and patients better afford the status quo. 
 Solving this problem presents a generational, multi-billion-dollar opportunity to become the payments and financing layer for healthcare transactions in the US. 
 We live every minute in that special, impactful area of overlap between healthcare and fintech knowing weâ€™re solving a big, important societal issue. If thatâ€™s exciting to you, then we would love to hear from you.
