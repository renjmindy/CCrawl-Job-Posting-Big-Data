 Got a Buyer for My Residential Plot 
 Jan 30 
 Posted by  NaranTeam 
 Mr. PS 
 I was planning to sell my sons residential plots for quite some time. But was not getting any buyer. 
 After reading Naran’s blog I started chanting “STAR OF BETHLEHEM FIND DIVINE BUYER COUNT NOW DONE” since Monday frequently. 
 I am happy to say that today I have finalised the deal. 
 This is again miraculous for me. 
 Explanation 
 STAR OF BETHLEHEM: is a Bach Flower Remedy prescribed to get a break – say a break in job situation for example. 
 Find, Divine, Count, Now and Done are Switch words. Buyer is the objective and not a switch word.

 CHANGE for a Better Offer 
 Nov 21 
 Posted by  NaranTeam 
 Niru, July 24 
 I want to change my job in the same company that I am presently working. 
 These days, my desperation is for changing the department but not the organization is increasing a lot. 
 Naran, July 27 
 Chant “CHANGE DIVINE ORDER” 
 Niru, August 29 
 As told by you I am chanting “Change Divine Order” as many times as possible and also writing “MIMULUS, LARCH” 51 times in a notebook (honestly speaking not every day). 
 I got an offer from another department yesterday. The HR formalities are still pending. I am praying everything should go smoothly and I should do extremely well in the new position. 
 One thing I noticed after I started writing Mimulus and Larch in the notebook is that I have become more peaceful. 
 Instead of worrying about what will happen to my future continuously now, whenever such thought comes to my mind I immediately tell myself ‘There is a divine force that will take me in the right direction’. The only thing I need to do is keep faith and keep chanting and believe in God. 
 Thank you for giving me this peace of mind. 
 Naran, August 31 
 Continue writing. 
 Chant “TOGETHER CHANGE DIVINE ORDER” 
 Niru, September 20 
 I am glad to inform you that I got a job in another department in the same company. I am chanting as told by you and writing as well. 
 Now my aim is to do extremely well in my new role and grow in position. 
 I also need the strength to take care of my aged parents and my daughter. Please let me know what I should chant for continuous peace of mind and prosperity in life. 
 Thanks you for your guidance without which I would not have had peace at all. 
 Naran 
 Chant “ELM, OAK, OLIVE” 
 Explanation 
 Change, Divine Order and Together are switch words, while Mimulus, Larch, Elm, Oak and Olive are Bach Flower remedies 
 Change Divine Order  : to change the situation to divine order 
 Larch  : for low self-confidence and develop an ‘I CAN’ attitude. 
 Mimulus  : fear of future about job 
 Together  : to bring all the forces inside us to achieve our objective. 
 Elm, Oak and Olive  : will provide both mental strength with smartness (required in office) and physical strength (to handle parents and daughter).

 Problem is like an Onion, Peel off one layer at a time 
 Aug 9 
 Posted by  NaranTeam 
 Uday 
 I am 40 yrs now and lost a job all of sudden first time in a successful career of 20 years. not able to get the job for last 3 months, seek your help and get the job. 
 Naran 
 Chant “STAR OF BETHLEHEM, ROCK ROSE, FIND DIVINE ORDER COUNT NOW DONE” 
 Explanation 
 Star of Bethlehem and Rock Rose are Bach Flower Remedies. STAR OF BETHLEHEM: to have a break through, ROCK ROSE: persevere with a great deal of endurance, and “FIND DIVINE ORDER COUNT NOW DONE”: switch words to get a job 
 Uday (after two weeks) 
 I started the chanting. With god grace and your valuable input, got 3 calls and 1 discussion at advance stage. Should I continue with same words or else. 
 Naran 
 This is how one should approach for a solution to any problem. Feed back is necessary. One suggestion is given. It is not the end. The healing is something similar to peeling of onion layers. Here the mind is to be peeled off, one by one. When the obstructing layer is peeled off, solution is born. Since we do not know which the obstructing layer is, we have to peel one by one. 
 Now chant during the interview “WATER VIOLET, LARCH, GENTIAN, WILD ROSE, MIMULUS”. 
 Explanation 
 Water Violet, Larch, Gentian, Wild Rose and Mimulus are Bach Flower Remedies. “WATER VIOLET, LARCH, GENTIAN, WILD ROSE”: the Bach Flower combination to attend an interview and MIMULUS: to handle fear of interview. 
 Uday (after 3 more days) 
 Dear Naranji, thank you for the input and I followed the same. In one of the opportunity where I am shortlisted, but they are offering salary 50% of my last drawn. Another one which was live now closed as they have done internal transfer. What should I do to get one job as opportunities are just coming and going away? 
 Naran 
 Chant “GENTIAN, SCLERANTHUS, CHANGE DIVINE ORDER” 100 times over a glass of water and drink it. 
 Uday (after 5 more days) 
 Naran you are amazing. I got a call on Sat after I started chanting Change divine order. Today I had a successful interview and expecting final round of discussion within next 2 days. I need your help to make this interview happen, offer to get closed before this weekend. 
 Naran 
 Chant “GENTIAN, HORNBEAM, FIND DIVINE ORDER COUNT NOW DONE”. 
 Uday (after 4 weeks in total) 
 Finally I got an offer matching my financial needs and of my experience. Thank you so much for your kind help for no reason. Pls suggest chant for successful joining and completion of probation period of 6 months 
 Naran 
 Chant “WATERVIOLET (to have an ego-less boss), WALNUT (to adjust easily to the new office environment, to overcome any prejudice), HOLLY (to be treated well), MIMULUS (for a friendly atmosphere)” during your probation.

 An Incredible Story!!! 
 Feb 20 
 Posted by  NaranTeam 
 Grace 
 I have been doing quite well at my job over the past few years. In my opinion, continually doing my best to complete what is asked of me in a timely fashion. 
 Earlier this year a new boss entered the company. A few months ago, I was assigned to work with him. Much to my dismay the new boss gave me several assignments to do complete all at once and over a period of weeks continuously complained that I was not fast enough and that the team members I was working with were not good at their job. I consider them experts in their field and relied on them heavily. 
 The boss was generally very negative and working with him dramatically altered my mood. As time went on I started to hear from some of my other managers of his complaints and worried about what they would think about me.  Previously, I had been very highly regarded. 
 Interestingly, enough his demanding unreasonable ways are not what pushed me to seek help but rather his critical perspective which I found intolerable. Not knowing what to do, I started chanting DIVINE ORDER on my own. 
 There was some improvement and I started to get more support from my managers. For the most part though, nothing was done about my growing workload. I tried to bear it as best as I could. 
 Meanwhile the threat of the new boss talking to others behind my back was causing me some serious anxiety. I realized through Naran that I could also chant PRAISE. I want to note that at first things got a little bit worse – several high pressured deadlines etc. 
 I reached out to Naran again since I didn't know what else to do…I had tried to accommodate incredibly tight deadlines and it seemed nothing would make this man happy. Naran told me to chant CENTAURY HOLLY PINE. I also added WILLOW based on some advice Naran had previously given me for home related issues. 
 The pressure came down quite quickly after that! I also noticed that I began to receive PRAISE from so many other places at my job. My other managers even met with me to let me know they realize the situation that I am in and offered to help me manage the intense workload in whatever way they could. 
 It’s hard to explain how dramatic of a turn around this was. 
 Also - and best of all there is some distance between my unreasonable boss and myself. He has assigned less and started to appreciate some of the work I have done for him in the past. I have also realized I need to be more compassionate towards him since he was obviously dealing with some stressors which may have caused him to behave this way. 
 In general I am WAY more relaxed at work which is good for all parties involved. 
 The chanting provides a mental/emotional shift which changes how you feel about people, situations and things. 
 Somehow the situation changes for the better. I learned through this situation that there was a pattern on my part regarding a hyper sensitivity to criticism. Instead, of hating him, I can thank my boss for helping me improve myself.  Incredible!!! 
 Naran 
 Our past is repeated, until we learn our lessons. 
 DIVINE ORDER  : Switch word to turn a situation from Chaos to Normalcy. 
 PRAISE  : A switch word that will make you praised by others. 
 Centaury, Holly, Pine and Willow are Bach Flower Remedies. 
 CENTAURY  : If you are unable to say no 
 **  HOLLY**: To bring down intense rage/anger 
 PINE  : from feeling low to feel good about oneself. 
 WILLOW  : to bring down the resentment and blaming tendency.

 My life is taken care of!!! 
 Jan 20 
 Posted by  NaranTeam 
 Obstacle-FREE LIFE 
 If you go on chanting DIVINE ORDER, everything will fall into place smoothly, without any obstacles. Everything will fall into place the moment you start it. 
 As soon as you get up in the morning, chant ‘DIVINE ORDER’ about 100 times. 
 No more mess 
 When there is a mess – chaos, confusion, where we cannot say how to go about, then chant DIVINE ORDER. 
 If there is chaos and confusion in the task on hand, then you can chant DIVINE ORDER. 
 Fix a HAPPY MARRIAGE 
 When we want a marriage to be fixed, we can chant DIVINE ORDER. If you keep chanting divine order, then everything will fall into place, for example, one who does not have sufficient funds will find funds (for marriage). You can also start chanting Divine Order before searching for a bride/ bridegroom. It is useful to find the right bride/groom. 
 Do WELL in INTERVIEWS 
 What is the use of FIND? It is to become confident. When you go for an interview it should go smoothly, when you are traveling by train, it must run smoothly. Like this there are several things. 
 You can also chant FIND DIVINE ORDER. It means that the person becomes confident and then everything will fall into place. 
 TRAVEL SAFE 
 So when you chant FIND DIVINE ORDER, firstly, you will become confident. In addition, you will also be confident that nothing wrong will take place. 
 Secondly, we will reach the destination early. 
 So when you travel, FIND DIVINE ORDER will be a very useful mantra. It is a  Travel Safe  mantra. 
 Reach Your Destination ON TIME 
 When the flight is at 4 p.m. and a person may go to the airport at 2 p.m. itself. But the plane won’t arrive on time. It will come around 6 or 8 p.m. If you don’t want such things to happen then you have to chant FIND DIVINE ORDER. 
 JOB SAFE 
 When you are about to lose the job or an opportunity or ranking in promotion (where two or more persons are due for the same and competing for it), at that time how it will work we cannot say. We cannot come off that desire either, as we always have desires for which we cannot do anything about!!! At that time, we can chant FIND DIVINE ORDER. Then the chanting person may not lose the opportunity. 
 Find a liar 
 FIND also means unearthing or discover. Wherever somebody tells a lie, we can find it out. Chant FIND. 
 To discover a dishonest person, before and during the meeting, or when someone comes for seeing a bride, at such times the switch word FIND will be useful. You may also chant FIND DIVINE ORDER then. 
 All words work wonderfully well. Some words may not work also. That we should not worry. Our work is towards healing only and therefore, we should not bother about the results. If we keep this in mind then always it will work better for us.

 Switch to Self-Care 
 Oct 22 
 Posted by  NaranTeam 
 Study CARE 
 CARE means to be careful. CARE will make the person study well, and observe well. 
 SLOW CARE is the switch word for children. You can make a big poster of SLOW CARE and paste it in the children’s room. Then he will study well. By this both concentration and memory will improve. CARE – will improve memory and SLOW – will improve concentration. 
 HOLD on to Good Behavior 
 For hyper active child, chant HOLD CONCEDE. HOLD means restrict, and CONCEDE means surrender. 
 For children who do not listen to the parents, CONCEDE … (name of the child). HOLD also means going/moving in the right direction, orderliness in addition to restriction. So for such children, who do not listen to their parents, chant the name of child and say CONCEDE HOLD. If you want you can also add DIVINE to that combination (CONCEDE HOLD DIVINE). 
 CORAL for MORAL 
 To make a person moral, CONCEDE HOLD DIVINE CORAL. CORAL (gem stone) means moral. CORAL can be used as a switch word, meaning moral. If we use this word CORAL, the person will become 100% moral. No doubt about it. Even after doing this if that person does not become moral, let him not change. So, leave him alone. 
 De-Addiction 
 Even for bad habits this is very good and for addiction too. I told you restriction is the keyword for HOLD. It will also restrict any addiction. How many words we can add to this CONCEDE? Like CLEAR, HOLD, DIVINE (CONCEDE CLEAR HOLD DIVINE) and so on. 
 Job CARE 
 What is the other usage of this switch word in our lives? When you are ignored for promotion, or when you are denied promotion – chant TOGETHER CARE DIVINE. 
 Exam CARE 
 Some children will not get sufficient marks in the exams and so we go for revaluation. CARE DIVINE will be of useful in such life situations. 
 Mantra for Good Speech 
 Chant the mantra, OM VACHASPATHAYE NAMAHA, which will activate the Throat Chakra. Vachaspathaye means Guru. “I prostrate to the lord of speech” is the meaning of this mantra.

 Gain and Re-gain Your Life’s Treasures 
 Oct 10 
 Posted by  NaranTeam 
 Find means to ‘gain’ and to ‘regain’. What is the meaning of regain? Once it was yours, so you have to regain it. However, for someone, they have to gain it in the first place. For both, we can use FIND. 
 Vacating the undesirable tenant 
 One person is staying in a rented place. He is not vacating the house, so find here means “to regain” – I have to regain the possession of my house. At that time, switch word FIND will work. 
 For small children pencil is very important and to regain the pencil is very important. Same value we have to give for the house also but we won’t give. We simply keep lamenting that some person has come and occupied our house. 
 A child might say that his friend has stolen his mobile phone. We can ask them to chant FIND. 
 Be confident and level-headed 
 You need to be level-headed in any situation. If you are afraid and panicky suddenly and you want your mind to work (by being level-headed) you can chant FIND. Level headed – to be confident in a new situation. 
 Get a Visa 
 For getting a visa also we can chant this – let us find out whether this word suits for getting a visa. To get a visa, we have to be confident. And if you are confident you should get your visa, isn’t it? So you can chant FIND or “FIND Visa”. 
 Anti-depressive tool 
 When you say FIND you will not be disappointed or sad. It is an anti-depressive word. What is depression – it is only sadness. FIND is a first class mantra for depression. 
 Healing Others 
 For healing others, you can write the name of the person on a paper and keep it in your hand and do the chanting. Or, you can write the name of the person on a piece of paper, draw concentric circles and write the switch words and do the healing. Or you can chant the switch words over a glass of water and give it to the concerned person. 
 However, I do not encourage healing for others. Instead we can tell them to chant. But, if you are disturbed by looking at such a person then you chant for your good. 
 Not to Fail 
 What do you mean by “Not to lose”? It means, “Not to fail”. Without writing anything in the exam will he pass if he keeps chanting FIND? He will, provided he does not write FIND on the paper 🙂 Not to fail in any examination – FIND. 
 FIND is a mantra for winning. For competitive exams, games etc you can use FIND. It will work wonders. 
 Not to lose anything, including your job 
 FIND can be written on a piece of paper and kept with us while going out of station, because wherever the word FIND is chanted, you will not lose anything. 
 The keyword for Find is: “You may not lose anything”. For example, a person may be afraid that he may lose his job. Then he can chant FIND. 
 Miracles are bound to happen 
 You can use just FIND or you can add even switch words to it. It is your choice. If you start chanting it, then miracles will happen for you.

 Job for my son 
 Apr 24 
 Posted by  NaranTeam 
 Hema's son is a marine engineer in US. For last, 4 months he was out of job. 
 Hema read the Newsletter on Switch Word. She chanted the Switch Word, "Find Divine Order Count Now Done", for the sake of her son. Within 3 days, he received a job offer from a company in Hamburg, Germany. 
 Please note that our children will not do it. We have to do it for them. That is the divine order. 
 Explanation 
 "Find Divine Order" - I need a job 
 If I get the job, I will "Count" money 
 When you want it happen? "Now" 
 "Done" - already happened 
 Please note the above Case History was discussed during the Monthly Meet, April 2009.  __
