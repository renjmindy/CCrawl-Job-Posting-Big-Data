 WARNING: A Note from the NYU Music Business Program ~ Don't Work for Monet MGM or Monet Artist Management 
 Posted on  06/16/201006/16/2010  by  The_Music_Business_Network  in  Job Opportunities ,  Notes From Music Business Network Members 
 A few weeks ago I received an email about how Monet MGM, also known as, Monet Artist Management, has not been paying its employees. Below is the email that I received, from the head of the Music Business Graduate Program at NYU Steinhardt, regarding this company and their failure to pay employees. Please note that Monet MGM is NOT a company that The Music Business Network is associated with. This posting is a warning to all current job seekers.
