 How do I send a proposal for a job? 
 Once you find a job that you're interested in by using the "Search Jobs" feature, you'll have the opportunity to submit a proposal to the client. A proposal is essentially an application for the job and will allow you to tell the client about your skills and experience, and why you're a good fit for their project. 
 How to submit a proposal 
 
 
 Use the "Search Jobs" page to search for jobs that meet your requirements. 
 
 
 Once you find a job you're interested in, click the "Show More" button. 
 
 
 Review the job description, requirements, and information about the client. If you decide you'd like to submit a proposal for the job click the "Send Proposal" button. 
 
 
 Answer the client's questions (if they've included any). Provide thorough and detailed answers to let the client know you have a solid grasp of the subject matter required for the project. 
 
 
 Once you've answered the client's questions, click on "Add Cover Letter." 
 
 
 Use the field provided to submit your rate for the project. 
 
 
 Use the field below to submit your cover letter. When writing your cover letter, include information about your background, work history, skills, experience, why you're a good fit for the job, and how you can help the client with their project. 
 
 
 Once you're happy with your cover letter click "Send Proposal" to submit your proposal. 
 
 
 You can click on the "Proposals" button in the Freelancer menu to monitor the status of your active proposals.
