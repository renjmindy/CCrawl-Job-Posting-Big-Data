 What we offer 
 Our  promise 
 Flexible working hours 
 Work smart. With flextime and home office opportunities, you can structure your work day in the way that best suits you and our projects. For us, providing for an excellent work-life balance is not a buzzword, but an integral part of our corporate culture. What you will find missing: massive overtime hours. 
 Genuine team work 
 Facilitating a regular exchange of experience is one of the most important maxims at WEVENTURE. We also ensure fast decision-making processes and a direct link to both colleagues and the management. 
 Fair remuneration 
 Job security is what we stand for. We invest in the future and career of our employees by offering permanent positions – with a fair remuneration and performance-based rewards. In addition, we offer a free sports and benefit package for all employees. 
 Continuous training 
 We are looking for people who strive to learn something new every single day. Through continuous training and further education opportunities, we ensure that we will always keep up with the digital transformation. Attend regular partner events and receive relevant certifications. 
 Free sports programs 
 A healthy mind in a healthy body – or put differently: even the most ambitious paper pushers might benefit from some push-ups and bench presses. We care about the health of our colleagues, that’s why we assume the costs for your sports activities. 
 Sabbatical 
 We appreciate loyalty and therefore promote sabbaticals: After five years of service, we will grant you an additional annual leave on top of your contractual entitlement. 
 Company pension scheme 
 Today we are young and wild, and tomorrow? Financially secure! Your old-age provision is important to us. That’s why we will support your private pension scheme with an own company pension scheme. 
 Attractive insurance package 
 Working for us, you will always be well-insured. All our employees are provided with additional accident insurance with worldwide coverage, meaning you don’t have to take out an additional private insurance. 
 Family-friendly atmosphere 
 Digital heroes will be needed tomorrow as well. As a family-friendly employer, we support the flexibility needed. Employees with families are offered reduced work schedules. 
 Free food and drinks 
 Start your day like a boss. By providing fresh fruit and cereals, we make sure that your day gets off to a good start. This also entails free coffee and a variety of soft drinks. In addition, we ensure you will always find an after-work beer in our well-stocked fridge to enjoy some quality time with your colleagues. 
 Free language classes 
 Languages ​​bring people together. You have already served international customers, but feel you might need some brushing-up on your foreign language skills? No problem. We offer private language classes for our colleagues on a regular basis. 
 Unforgettable team events 
 Birds of a feather flock together. Our regular team events are a great opportunity to let loose and get to know each other better. In keeping with the motto “Work hard, play hard”, we definitely know what exciting team-building events must look like. 
 Haven 't found an open position that suits you? 
 No problem! 
 You stand for an extra amount of entrepreneurial spirit and believe your personal skills will make a valuable contribution to our projects? Then please send us your unsolicited application.
