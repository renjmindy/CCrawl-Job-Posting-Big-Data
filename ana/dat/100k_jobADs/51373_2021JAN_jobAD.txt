 I HAVE A JOB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 I'm so damn excited!!!!! I get to use my brain every day! I'm gonna be writing narratives for urban renewal grants, working on EPA reports, and proofreading Iowa city codes. And guess what? My boss treats me like an adult! A competent, real adult! You might not think it was such a big deal, but trust me, it's not a given. I am excited to work hard and earn the amazing benefits she's giving me. I'm excited to be part of helping citizens of my beloved state get services they need. I'm excited for using my degree finally! I think I'll just wish I'd have paid more attention in Semanticsâ€¦..Phonology isn't so helpful now. haha 
 The whole thing came about really organically and really quickly. I saw my new boss while working for another local company. She asked what I was up to, I told her, and she took my email address. I ended up emailing her my resume and references. Another week later she came back into the store, and we met up last week for an interview! I started yesterday and already have responsibilities and questions and research to do! 
 I was quite nervous yesterday morning and had to give myself a little pep talk! Just because things didn't work out the last time I had a(n almost) real job, doesn't mean things won't work out this time! The last job couldn't keep a person like me around for more than a couple years, but this place has employees who've been there for about 30 years! That's really saying something! I get a key this time around, which is cool. I told my boss it'd be more likely that I would be the last to leave, as opposed to being the first one there. haha She's encouraged me to volunteer so I'm excited to keep working at the Gardens in my town on Friday mornings. She's encouraged me to be on a Chamber committee! So long as I'm trusted to get my work done. Deal. 
 I'm excited to be an adult again. Someone who can pay some bills. Save some money. Visit friends. Visit my birthfamily. Buy a bigger bed. Treat my mom to something fun. Treat my friends. And generally pass on the kindness that has been shown to me by so many friends and family. No, money doesn't buy happiness, but it does buy a peace of mind. A confidence. Independence. And I can't wait ðŸ™‚

 So, what happened to you since we last heard from you, Angela? 
 Where have you been?! 
 Okay, what's your resolution for 2014, Ang? 
 What's gotten you in such a huff?
