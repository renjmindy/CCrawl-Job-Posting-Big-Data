 Career Or Job? 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  problem solving 
 Are you on the hunt for a career or a job? There's a couple of assumptions here; a) there's a difference and b) you know the difference. 
 A career involves employment in a specific field over a period of time, during which you apply the education you've achieved. A job on the other hand, is typically shorter-term in nature, undertaken with a goal of gaining experience or money. A job does not always make use of one's education. 
 Hang on. Do you buy those two distinctions? Is it as simple as I've set it out? If someone walked into a store and applied for a Cashier position, we might say they have a job as a Cashier. It's not likely we'd agree the person is a career Cashier. However, what if we were to check in with them 9 years later and they are still in the same role? Would we then say the person is working in Retail as a Cashier and has a career? So then does the length of time a person works in a job transform the job into a career? 
 I don't know that it really much matters to be honest. Oh I suppose when you're out at some swanky affair and people invariably ask what you do, it might have social advantages to have a career over a job; well to some at any rate. But both careers and jobs have similarities. Both provide income, both can be rewarding to the people in them, and both can lead to promotions and be of varying length. There is no guarantee that a career will last longer than a job. 
 That last comment about the length of time one invests in a role might have some in disagreement. Suppose you graduate from University with a degree and take a position with an organization. You were specifically hired in part due to your academic qualifications. I think it fair to say most folks would feel you've just launched your career. Said this way, you are at the beginning of your full-time work life and yet, many would also say you've landed a full-time job. Perhaps then they are interchangable. 
 But hold on. Suppose you quit high school in order to take a position with the local lumberyard doing yard clean up and helping customers load their purchases. Again, most folks will say you've got yourself a job, but how many would say you've just launched your career? Fewer I imagine than the example in the previous paragraph. And yet, if you advanced through the business from yard clean up to Foreman, then moved inside to Sales Representative working with Contractors based on your accumulated experience, then were promoted to head up the Construction and Renovation Sales division, would we then say you've carved out a career for yourself? Would people say your'e a career lumber guy or woman? 
 I'll tell you this; there are a lot of people holding out for some career to provide them with direction when what they really need is a job. Likewise, there are people searching right now for jobs who would be well-advised to pour their energy into pursuing their careers. 
 You might think at this point I'm only messing with words and confusing you for the sake of my own amusement. In truth however, there are people - many people - who fret and worry feeling immense pressure to pick a career. Likewise there are people who feel incredible pressue to get a job. 
 What really distinguishes the two to my way of thinking is how a person perceives them based on their own value system. Let's make that personal. If YOU hold a career as being more prestigeous and look at jobs as holding less worth, then YOU set yourself up to feel inadequate and underachieving unless YOU are in a career. Then throw in the happiness factor, the I-need-a-career-that-fulfills-me factor and you've set yourself up for a high-stress period while you search for a career that will fulfill you and bring you happiness. 
 But there's work to be done out there people and the truth is we need people in jobs and careers in order to get it done. Working in the trades as a Plumber, Electrician, HVAC Technician, Carpenter etc. takes job-specific skills and some aquired knowledge to become an expert. Try telling the Electrician she or he holds a job but not a career and I think they'll beg to differ. Again, it's about perception. 
 You likely hold up certain professions as loftier and holding greater value over others. How do you view a Lawyer vs. a Roofer, a Mechanic vs. a Receptionsit, a Truck Driver vs. an Architect? I'll tell you this; your view may change depending on your need for that individual. When your shingles blow off your roof, you want a career professional up there fixing it, not someone who 'just' holds a job. 
 Think about your own perception of jobs vs. careers and think also about how your values are passed on to those you influence most; your children. While it's natural to have your own value system, it's incumbant upon us all to equally respect the values of others, especially if they differ from our own. If we do this, a lot of people would feel less pressure to pick a career, less stigma when considering a job.

 What Hopes Do You Have For 2020? 
 decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  interviewing ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  problem solving 
 Start thinking about January 2020 and what you'd like to see happen for you personally in the new year. It's the 13th of December today, so we've got 18 days left in this year to come up with a few things. 
 So what are you after? A job perhaps? Perhaps a better job. Maybe you're considering a return to school in order to finish your high school diploma or launch yourself into a new career by attending College or University. Could be a change in your diet is in mind; getting healthier, being kinder, showing more patience and forgiveness or even getting around to popping THE question to your special someone. There's any number of things you might be hoping will happen in 2020. 
 Okay so have you something that came to mind? Something you're hoping for in the coming year? Let's go with whatever came to mind. Of course, we're only in the third paragraph here, and you might need a few more hours or days to come up with what you really want to see happen next year. But even in this short time since you first started reading, think for a second about what DID come into your mind first and foremost. Hmm… why did that surface? Could be that whatever it was came to mind for good reason. 
 Now hoping for something is always good. Hope is a wonderful thing, because it can keep us going in tough times and it can sustain us when things look bleakest. I'm a big believer in hope. However, while hope is a good thing to have, you'll likely find that hope alone doesn't always bring about the things we hope for. Confused? Okay, I can understand that. 
 Hope often needs a plan and action to bring about the realization of whatever it is we've hoped for. You can hope to play a musical instrument, but the odds of picking up a trumpet and playing it instantly or sitting before a piano and bringing your favourite song to life are minute as best. You'd agree I think that planning to take some lessons, finding someone to instruct you and putting in the practice to actually learn how to play is increasing your odds of success. Hoping to play an instrument in 2020? Find a teacher, rent, borrow, buy or get gifted an instrument and you're giving your hopes a fighting chance. 
 Now supposing that you're hoping to find a job in the new year. That's a good thing. You feel mentally up for it and 2020 is going to be your year. Congratulations on coming up with a commendable ambition for the new year. So the question now is what has to happen in order for your hopes of employment to come about? 
 These days you typically need a resume, computer skills to apply online, interview skills to perform well when meeting with someone from an organization, and a little self-confidence and self-esteem thrown in would be a big help too. I'm simplifying things here for the sake of illustration, but let's go with that list: basic computer skills, a resume, interview skills and practice and some self-confidence. 
 By listing the things above that you'll need to successfully find work, you can then move to the next phase which is turning to the community in which you live and the people you know in it, seeking to find the help in acquiring the skills to check off each need. You may believe you have a good resume - well, good enough at any rate - but having someone look at it who can make some helpful and intelligent suggestions for improvement would confirm your belief. If it's good, that's great. If however it's not as good as you believe it is, you'll save yourself a lot of frustration and disappointment by learning how to improve it and then doing so. 
 As for the computer skills? Well, basic skills needed to compete for jobs these days means you have to be able to send and receive emails, attach your resume and cover letters, know how to upload a resume to a job site online, and of course being able to sit down and type out that resume and cover letter is required too. Can you do these things? If so, again, great! If not, a basic computer class is all you need to learn these essentials. 
 Okay so on to the interview skills. Mom or dad might be okay to practice with, but I would guess they aren't up on using the STAR interview method or know much about behaviour based interviewing. For interview help, you'll want to tap into someone perhaps at a local employment centre, maybe even going so far as to hire the services of a self-employed Employment Specialist or Recruiter. These are options you might want to look into. 
 Hope as I say is really good to have. Hope alone however usually doesn't bring about whatever it is you're hoping for. Action is what you'll need, and your action is best put into place only after you first settle on a plan. With no plan, your actions might give you the illusion of doing something to move toward your goal but in reality just be one step forward and two back. Plan your work, work your plan. 
 A job, a relationship, a purchase. Whatever you hope for in 2020, here's to hoping it comes true.

 It's Probable You're In The Wrong Job 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  mental health ,  philosophy ,  problem solving 
 It's a huge world we live in, with everything from densely populated urban areas to rural districts and places of relative isolation. There's mountainous regions, prairies and wetlands, coasts, deserts, wastelands and watersheds. Out of the billions of places you might have entered the world, chance plopped you into it where it did. Where you entered this game of Life is one of the key determinants to what you'll do job/career-wise. 
 Speaking of jobs and careers, there's an abundance of these world-wide too. If you attempted to list all the jobs that exist in the world, how do you think you'd fare? My guess is you'd do poorly - and so too would I for that matter. There are those jobs we'd readily find in many populous areas world-wide like Servers, Teachers, Factory Workers, Drivers etc. and we'd likely have these pop to mind. However would you also have Dolly Grip, Actuarial Analyst, Pet Insurance Agent, Bung Hole Borer or Brand Evangelist on your list? No, not likely. 
 The thing is, there are more jobs we don't know exist than those we do. So what are the odds that you're in the single perfect job - I mean, THE one you were put on this planet to excel at? Doesn't it appear rather unlikely that of all the places you could be in the world, somehow you occupy the one city block you were meant to occupy, and that the one job - that single, perfect role you were meant to aspire to and succeed at is within an easy commute? While we're at it, if you believe soulmates and partners are a one in a million catch, what are the odds they live nearby too? You're odds of having the perfect job, in the perfect community, living happily with the person you were put on this earth to love for all eternity is astronomical! 
 Hang on a moment, let's not get carried away. As we look around, we do see people - and plenty of them - who are happily engaged in the work they do, they're in healthy, loving relationships and they fit in with the environment they live in. So how did they beat such incredible odds? More importantly, if they did it, how can we duplicate that happiness and success? 
 It begins with discarding the notion that there is only a single job in existence that will bring us satisfaction. This notion that we have to find that one job we were meant to do is the delusion that keeps many from finding job satisfaction. You can travel to other cities, countries, continents even, and end up doing a job that had you looked, you'd have found nearby in your own community, or in dozens of communities around the globe. So if you're born in the city but dig a mining career (hope you enjoyed that one), yes you might find yourself relocating to a mining town, but there are lots of those to choose from. 
 The truth in my opinion is that we're a multi-talented creature we humans, and as such, there are many jobs that will stimulate our need for job satisfaction. If being around people and helping others is our thing, we can fulfill this desire in many professions; any one of which will bring us happiness and have us feel satisfied at the end of a day. If we're more inclined to like work that we do in relative isolation, we don't have to be a Forest Ranger in a lookout tower or even leave the cities we find ourselves in. There exist jobs right in the heart of densely populated cities that people do in isolating roles. 
 One thing I'd encourage you to do, and do with periodic regularity, is find a quiet space and listen to yourself. It sounds trite, it sounds corny, it might sound downright silly and a right eyerolling, "you've got to be kidding?" moment, but listen to your inner voice. If you don't go to work happily on most days, if you don't find satisfaction in your work and find yourself clock-watching every fifteen minutes, what are you doing there? You've got this one life and time is ticking. As time goes on, options you once had start disappearing. The prison you might find yourself in, chained to a job you come to loathe is one of your own design. Get out into the world and move on before you close the door on yourself. If you don't, blame yourself, not the world. 
 If you don't hear that inner voice pulling you in some other direction, excellent! However, if something keeps nagging at you that there has to be something better, something different, more fulfilling; shouldn't you be paying attention to that pull? I mean at least explore the possibility of whatever it is that suggests there's something else you could and probably should be doing? The price you pay to look around is cheaper than the fortune it'll cost you to lock yourself into a job that brings you nothing but money. 
 Sure, there's the usual snags to this thinking: "I have bills, responsibilities, people depend on me, I have to play it safe, my time has come and gone." Seriously? That's sad isn't it? You're hearts still beating right? Oh good, because it sounded like you were already dead. 
 A stimulating job or career is nearby; open your mind and your eyes to the possibilities and do something great!

 A Few Ways To Start Your Job/Career 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  older workers ,  trust 
 Thinking back on the early part of your work history, how did you get one of your earliest jobs? 
 Some people get jobs by following in their parents footsteps. You know, it's the family expectation that you'll become an Accountant because, well, your dad is an Accountant, your older brothers and sisters are Accountants; even your grandparents were Accountants. So there's not much if any discussion about what you might be when it's your turn to enter the world of work. Nobody really talks about what might interest you because you're slotted in as the next Accountant in the family, carrying on the tradition. 
 This might sound like a bad thing but for many people it is exactly the opposite. You see they don't have worry or stress deciding on a career, they've got excellent resources to draw on in the family when they need help and advice, and these family connections are their way in to the companies they work for. All they have to do really is follow the plan laid out for them. Yes for some people, this is normal, and they never really experience the conflict of self-determination, nor do they fight it. 
 Of course not everyone takes this path. The problem with this model for those who don't follow it is that they may be drawn in other ways to other jobs. They might be creative, artistic, innovative and there's no room for these qualities in the world of Accounting where numbers are input accurately and precisely. Following the, 'family way' and living your life playing up to the expectations of parents and extended family could leave you feeling unsatisfied, unfulfilled and always wondering why you don't discover what it is you feel you're really meant to do. 
 Others follow their passion. With an interest in music, they may not be a celebrity, but they work in the music industry. Or, if the environment is what they feel drawn to, they work to save precious physical resources, encouraging others to live their lives thinking about sustainability and protecting our natural resources. They don't necessarily have to work in a Ranger Tower in the middle of a Boreal forest; they might even work in a laboratory in a city but devote their time to finding better solutions to problems of creating and cleaning up our environmental waste. 
 If it's not the environment that drives you, it could be a passion for sports. Perhaps you turn your love of physical activity and how the body exerts itself into sports medicine, physiotherapy, chiropractic work or you get a job working in a sports venue where you're surrounded all day long by others similarly motivated. This can be very stimulating and adds a layer to the work you do everyday you wouldn't get working in the same job but for a different employer. So back to my Accountant, you might be employed by your favourite sports team and the combination of the job and the organization might feed your need for satisfaction. 
 Many more people fall into jobs. They might take a summer job or a short-term contract job just starting out and without any planning they end up staying around for 25 years! Or they could get started when a friend asks them for a hand working on constructing a house and find they have a knack for building and end up in a classroom taking courses on home construction, codes and by-laws. "How'd I get into this?" is the kind of thing they wonder at some point, but they have no regrets. 
 Another way some go about finding work is simply to get going. I mean, these people figure the best way to find out what they'd like to do is just start working at a job, try it out for awhile and pay attention to the things they like and don't enjoy. Then they move on and try something different; again paying attention to the things they find satisfying and want more of and always taking jobs that have less of the things they want to avoid. Systematically, they end up doing a variety of jobs, having a diversified resume and are better able to adapt into many roles. 
 The strength for those who take this last route is that being able to adapt well, they are resilient when change occurs. Whether the change comes from an external source - like being laid off or a company relocating elsewhere - or the change comes from within - a personal desire to move on - they can adapt quicker to change than those who have spend 25 years in a single job. 
 You can see there are many ways to get going when it comes to finding work. There isn't one accepted way and all of the above are valid. Each way comes with it's advantages and some disadvantages. Determining which is right for you is important, but remember that what's right for one person is not necessarily right for another. 
 So, how did you get started? How did you get into your present job? Your comments are welcome and will be of most benefit to readers who are either on the cusp of entering the world of work or in the early stages of their careers and jobs. 
 Tell your story of how you got started and how it worked out for you. Was it a great fit? Are you still in that role or how long did it last?

 Yes! Get Excited About Getting Stuff! 
 decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  job searching ,  mental health ,  relationship building 
 I'm sure by now you've come across those social media posts where there's a lovely picture in the background and some famous quote or suggestion someone has for living your life in the foreground. I see this on a regular basis and if you enjoy these, just type, "quotes with pictures" in your favourite search engine and you'll see thousands. 
 So yesterday evening, I happened to come across two such items and in both cases, they were broadcasting a similar message; don't get too hung up on acquiring stuff because one day you'll realize it's people, not owning things that's important. Now these random quotes that pop up unexpectedly have become for many, the words of wisdom which in generations past, you'd have received from the revered and older members of your family; i.e.. pre-internet, pre-computer world. Someone you greatly respected would tell you to live your life a certain way and you'd think about that seriously, because of your respect for them. Not only that, you didn't have too many people giving you this sage advice way back when. 
 However today, all you have to do is go online and it seems everyone is not only sharing such quotes they like with the world, they are creating their own words to live by and taking or finding pictures they feel convey the right mood to go with them. It's not like these are being passed on by the elders of a village, a wise man nestled in some mountain retreat, or a woman who has lived a long, rich life having traveled the world several times over and experienced life to its fullest. No often these quotes on how to live your life are coming from adolescents who haven't reached their 14th birthday yet, troubled people looking for an outlet and/or audience to make them feel validated, heard and followed. How much living have they done? Based on what are they in a position to prescribe how you and I should live our lives? 
 I thought for a moment and paused over this post that came into my evening unasked for. There it was, reminding me that wanting and getting things in life isn't important, and that one day I would realize that it's people I should be going after, not things. And I thought, "no; you're wrong." 
 There's nothing wrong (in my opinion) with going after things in life we want, surrounding ourselves with objects and possessions which bring a smile to our face, that make us feel good and that just by owning, make us happy. We can still get and have these things in our lives AND have positive relationships with people if we so choose, at the same time. In fact, for those that don't enjoy being surrounded by people in their lives, owning things that make us feel comfortable and good - well, that's a good thing. 
 Take the 4 or 5 year old at their birthday or Christmas. We encourage excitement, happiness and good feelings as they open presents. If such a child said, "Well thanks, but you know, none of these really do it for me, I'd rather just go over and spend a few minutes with dad", we'd be both amazed and question if we got the wrong thing. We might wonder why they aren't happy and as excited as we'd have expected. No, we set our kids up to be excited when given a gift or possession. As they get older, we get excited when they show us something they've bought that makes them feel good; we say things like, "Well done! I'm so proud of you!", when they buy their first car, rent their first apartment, get handed their diploma or win some competition in school or community sports. 
 For most of us, surrounding ourselves with the things we want means needing to exchange money for those goods; money that typically comes from employment. Whether it's a souvenir from a trip, the latest technology, a dress, shoes, new tattoo, comfortable bed or a new car, all these things bring us some measure of happiness. There is nothing wrong about going after them and being excited to acquire them. Nor should we feel we have to hide our accomplishments, like getting our Masters, passing a course with great marks, or getting a promotion or raise at work. These are THINGS to share with pride and yes, we who hear of others good news should just applaud their accomplishments and be happy right along with them. 
 Somehow though, a warm and cuddly picture of a puppy with the quote, "Get a job, get money, buy stuff", wouldn't go over as well I don't think. So perhaps it's the balance of acquiring things that make us feel good (and feeling good is what we're all after) and having people in our lives (if this is what we want of course) that we strive for? Just perhaps. The thing is this… no one person has ever come up with a quote or way to live your life statement that universally applies to every person who has ever been, nor who will ever be, nor who lives at the moment. 
 Live your own life, go after the stuff that makes you feel awesome inside. An outfit, new wheels, toys, trips, a job, furniture or an address. Go for it! Get excited about that stuff!

 Getting Past, "So What Do You Do?" 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  interviewing ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  mental health ,  relationship building ,  trust 
 Within the first few minutes of meeting someone for the first time, you're likely to be asked some version of the question about what it is you do. When you've got a job or career, it's a comfortable question to answer, especially if you enjoy your job. However, when you're out of work and can't find a job, that question can be irritating because for many, it's hard to answer and not feel some embarrassment or even shame. A solid answer and we feel good, a vague answer or stating we're unemployed and we feel bad. Why? Because either way, we can feel that we're setting ourselves up to be judged. 
 The work we do is of course only one aspect of who we are as a person, but it's the one thing that keeps coming up early in those introductions when first impressions count so much. I suppose it's asking about something that's viewed as a social norm and not too invasive. However, if you've ever told someone you're between jobs or out of work and had them quickly walk away and begin a conversation elsewhere, you know that feeling and isn't a good one. You just know that you've been judged and deemed in some way not up to par. 
 Like I said though, our occupation is only one part of who we are as people. Some of our other pieces include the state of our finances, social life, housing, spiritual, emotional, physical or mental health. There's our use of personal time, beliefs, personal philosophies, values, leadership styles, the way we interact with the natural world, places we've been, accomplishments, hobbies, intelligence IQ, However just imagine your reaction if someone introduced themselves and said, "Hi, I'm Dave. So generally speaking, how healthy is your investment portfolio?" 
 The curious thing is that people with what society might regard as a prestigious job - say a Family Law Lawyer, Chief Executive Officer, Coroner or even a Teacher, aren't automatically better people than the rest of us. They have problem marriages, dysfunctional families, stresses, mental health issues and challenges just like you and me. But still we start those conversations with asking about what someone does for a living. 
 If you listen to people talk about themselves, you can clearly hear them share what they want you to know. If they keep bringing up their job and the work they do, they might be doing so because this is an area they feel comfortable and proud talking about. They believe that this aspect of their life is one you'll judge them favourably by and walk away with a positive impression of them. 
 Now when you're not working but would like to be, talking about your unemployment can have the reverse effect. This isn't an area where you feel on solid ground in a conversation and your fear of being judged negatively and leaving a poor impression is heightened. We constantly hear how making good first impressions is important, and we know this ice-breaker topic is likely to come up, so consequently some people will avoid social situations completely to limit the number of bad first impressions they'll make. This 'feeling bad' about not having an answer to share with confidence and pride just reinforces our feelings of not fitting in until we've found work once again. 
 There's some irony however in that the percentage of adults who have at some time in their lives been out of work is quite high. Being laid off from your job is something typically beyond your own control. When a company moves or shrinks its workforce, it's well beyond your ability to keep your job. Still, when at that social gathering, it would seem weird to say, "Hi, I'm Joan and I was let go 6 month's ago for reasons beyond my control and I'm now unemployed." 
 This is however, part of a great answer if you're introducing yourself at a job fair for unemployed people looking for work. Imagine what a relief it would be to be in a room surrounded by others out of work, where everyone is in the same predicament. Asking, "What do you do for a living?" would be replaced with, "So what kind of work are you after?" The feeling is more positive - you're after something - being proactive. 
 Wait a second…maybe we're on to something here… 
 Just imagine you meet someone for the first time and they ask you, "So what do you do for a living?", and you said, "At the moment I'm pursuing work as a _____. It's a great fit for me personally and I've got the education and experience. If you have any connections or leads I'd appreciate being hearing about them." 
 What do you think? Instead of feeling embarrassed or dreading the question because of a weak response, you've taken an assertive position. You've told them what you're after and you've shifted their thoughts to whom they might know, how they might help you, and all it takes is one person to give you a name that could lead to that next interview that results in a job. 
 Why, you might even give them your contact information, or ask for theirs and follow-up in a couple of days with a call or an email. Try it once and it's new and awkward. Twice and it's easier; often and you're an assertive networker.

 This Job Search Should Be Exciting! 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  mental health ,  older workers ,  philosophy ,  relationship building 
 The people who come to me for help getting a job hardly ever describe this point in their lives as exciting. No, to be honest, it's typically a time of frustration and heightened stress. The majority of people I've assisted come to me only after they've attempted to gain employment themselves or with the help of others and had little to zero success at even getting interviews let alone job offers. So yes, by the time they reach out to me personally, their pretty frustrated with the job search process. 
 So you can easily imagine that when I talk about the search as a time which should be exciting, it would be a pretty hard sell. After all, it's pretty hard to work up a lot of enthusiasm, energy and excitement for something that's sucking the very life out of a person's day-to-day living. When you think about it though, it can and should be a time to ramp up the motivation and that should bring some positive energy. Let me explain. 
 For starters, you're at a juncture in your life where you have the availability of time to decide what it is you want to do next. Many working people who are not happy in their current jobs want to look for something they'll find more rewarding, but their current job and the hours it requires them to work don't give them any time to explore what other options they have. After they've put in the hours they do, there's not much energy and enthusiasm for doing extra work on their personal time. So ironically what do they do? They continue to go in day after day to the job they don't want to do anymore, and envy those - like you perhaps - who have the luxury of personal time to figure out your next move. 
 Here's a second point that should be positive; skill identification. We all have them you know; a multitude of skills and abilities which we don't often give ourselves credit for. What are you good at? What qualities do you have that you've come to recognize yourself - or had pointed out by others - as having competence or excellence in? There's no time for modesty here and this isn't about boasting and massaging your self-ego. This is about objectively naming the things you do well. Having a list of things - and written by the way - of the things you excel at is good for how you perceive yourself. If you're feeling fragile and vulnerable being out of work, this exercise is a really good step to take to rebuild that confidence. 
 Now you have a list of the things that other people have recognized as your strengths, as well as thing you believe you're good at. Look it over a few times, dwelling on each quality or word and letting each one sink in for a bit before looking at the next one. Don't gloss over this list with a quick scan: this is you we're talking about after all! 
 Now, all those jobs you've held in the past; let's think about them individually. Put down in writing things you liked and disliked about each one. Consider the things you generally did in the job, the boss you worked for, the people who surrounded you (or didn't as the case may be). Think about the environment you worked in, the commute, the hours, the pay and your level of customer contact. What did you enjoy or dislike in each position? What did you learn or come to appreciate? Having done this for each job you've held, now look at all the jobs you've done and look for trends and what comes up again and again. 
 At this point, you should know pretty well the things you're good at (strengths), the things that appeal to you and the things you'd like to avoid in your next position. 
 Now time to turn to what jobs are out there. This is where the excitement really ramps up. Having the attitude and belief that you're in full control is critical. Your attitude is essential for making this job search a positive experience. You could choose to work nearby or at a distance; do something new or do what you've always done. You could choose a return to school to learn something new or upgrade existing skills via a course - online or in person. You can choose to go at this job search full-time or put in part-time hours. Work from home or work on the employer's site, etc. 
 Yes you may be in a period of flux; change and chaos, where regular routines are in turmoil and upheaval, where your finances and patience are both tested. Out of this chaos however, REAL change is not only possible but probable - if you want it to the degree where your thoughts and actions bring it about. 
 You are the sole person - for good or bad my friend - who ultimately will decide your destiny; how long or short the job search will be, what you'll end up doing. This can be a time of excitement and opportunities to seize, or it can be a low point in your life full of negatively, setbacks and disappointments. 
 Yes, you didn't think you'd be here at this time. But here you are. How you look at things can determine how you look to employers. Think on things!

 Why Aren't You Working? 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  mental health ,  older workers ,  philosophy ,  relationship building ,  social assistance 
 There are many reasons why people aren't working; what's yours? Some possibilities are: 
 
 Not looking for work 
 Physical or mental health restrictions 
 Poor interview skills 
 Weak resume 
 Unsure what to do 
 Attending school full-time 
 Raising pre-school age children and unable/unwilling to find childcare 
 Required as a primary caregiver for a family member 
 Not motivated 
 
 This isn't an exhaustive list of course, just enough to stimulate some thought, give enough possibilities that some of my audience is captured and yes, perhaps enlighten those that think there's only one reason anyone would be out of work - laziness. 
 The first and last reasons on my list - not looking and not motivated one could easily argue are so related they are really the same; ie. not motivated to look for work. For some people, this is absolutely true. Would you agree there are those who aren't motivated enough to seek out a job? I mean, I know people who fit this category and I suspect you do as well. They have shelter and food provided by someone or some organization, their needs are modest, their motivation to work to earn enough money to support themselves just isn't enough to get them going. 
 Perhaps it's a phrase in that last sentence that is the real issue for many; the idea that money to support themselves is the motivation to work. Money does of course, provide the means to acquire housing and food, as well as the discretionary things in life which for many improves their quality of life. However, working to support oneself when you're already being supported isn't much motivation. In other words, if you're not working but getting housed and fed, you might not be motivated to work 7 hours a day just to get housed and fed - something you already have. 
 Work therefore, or more importantly, the motivation to choose to work, has to come when there's more to be gained than just money for basic support. For some it can be an issue of dignity vs. shame or embarrassment. Support yourself with your own source of income and you feel independence, a sense of being in control of what you do, where you live, what you do with your money, who knows your personal business and who doesn't. 
 For some people, work provides social interaction. Be it with co-workers or customers, there's some connection to other people, which stimulates our feelings of inclusiveness; we are part of something and not isolated. Feeling isolated, left behind, left out, missing out - these are common to people who don't work in some cases. Of course, other unemployed people will tell you they get all the interaction with people they want; many of those they 'hang with" themselves being unemployed. 
 Feeling a sense of purpose is one thing employed people often tout as the best part of their jobs. What they do is significant and important to some part of our population, and this feeling of purpose gives identity to the working person. The problem for some who struggle to find a job is in fact deciding on what job to do; in other words, they are focused so much on finding their purpose, they get paralyzed waiting for it to materialize. 
 The irony is that when you're unsure what to do with your life, often the best way to discover it is to start working! It is through work that you learn where your skills are, which skills you wish to develop and improve on, what you like and don't. You learn through success and failure what you're good at, where you make a difference, where you're appreciated for your service and what you do and don't want to do in future jobs. The idea that at 20 years old you should have the next 43 years all laid out clearly before you is a myth. You'll change jobs and careers in your lifetime - perhaps 7 or 8 times or more and this is normal. 
 For some - and you may not like this truth - it is a question of not trying hard enough. Don't get me wrong, I'm not painting everyone with the same brush, and I'm not saying some people who are out of work don't put in huge amounts of energy and time. However, if you've gone at your job search seriously with no success for a long time, its high time you partnered up with someone and get the guidance and support you obviously need to increase the odds of success. This is precisely the action many don't want to take and that's a puzzlement. 
 The crux of the thing is it's essential that you're honest with yourself when it comes to why you're not working. What you tell others who ask may not be the real reason; what you know to be at the heart of why you aren't working is the truth. So what is it? 
 Good questions might be: 
 
 Why aren't I working? 
 Am I genuinely happy not working? 
 What's stopping me? (Is it really me?) 
 Where could I get help and support to find work? 
 What would make me more employable? 
 Who might help me discover my strengths and interests? 
 How do I get help with childcare, transportation, the issue of my age? 
 Would volunteering somewhere be the best way to start? 
 
 I'd love to hear your thoughts on this issue; whether it's you or someone you know out of work.

 "Apply For A Job I Don't Truly Want?" 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  interviewing ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  mental health ,  older workers 
 There are the jobs we'd love to do; the one's that get us really excited at the prospect of being offered the opportunity as the preferred candidate. Then there are the jobs which we are qualified to do, but don't really turn us on to the same degree; they might be a little to far away for our liking, not quite pay what we want, or perhaps aren't in the size of the organization we'd like. So should we apply for both kinds of job with the same commitment? 
 From an employer's point of view, the answer is probably a big, "No!" After all, it hardly seems fair to them if some of the job applicants applying for the job opening aren't truly invested in the application. If they ended up being offered the job only to then turn it down, that would be a lot of time, energy and yes money invested in the hiring process only to have to go back to other applicants. 
 From your point of view as a job seeker, the answer is less obvious. On the one hand, we all only have so much time and energy. Your time is no less valuable than an employer's, and so you could argue that your focus should be clearly and only on jobs you really want; jobs you'd happily take if offered. 
 However, there are compelling reasons to apply for jobs that you're not on fire for. Suppose for example you've got a criminal record. It's from 8 or 9 years ago - maybe even further back in your past - but it's still sitting there should a criminal reference check be done. In such a situation, you probably dread the inevitable question in an interview that could scuttle your chances at getting hired. In fact, you've probably already lost out on jobs for this very reason, so you've got good cause to feel anxious; for no matter how qualified or well you present yourself, that conviction always seems to get you in the end. 
 To help yourself, you've sought out help from someone at a local employment centre and you've had a mock interview or two to practice your answer. Your dilemma is wondering if the first time you try out your new response to the question should be at your dream job. After all, if practice makes perfect, a mock interview palls in comparison to a real interview with a real employer where a real job is on the line. 
 In such a situation, yes, you might be wise to consider applying for a job which you're qualified to do, but doesn't hit all the required boxes to qualify as your dream job. If as you'd hoped, the response you give is well received and results in a favourable outcome, this will bolster your confidence in future interviews, because you have proof that you can get past this previously impossible barrier. The same would apply if you've been terminated, you have no employment history whatsoever, you've got a large gap in your résumé, you're feeling old etc. There are all kinds of situations where you might feel vulnerable, easily exposed and as a result, don't present well in an interview. For these situations and more, going through a live interview to practice and testing out new approaches could be excellent advice. 
 The interesting part is that sometimes you might get offered a job and as much as you don't believe it's possible now, you do actually accept the job. After all, hey, it's a job! Taking this position will be something current on your résumé, you'll get new references should you do well, your past criminal record might diminish in importance if you prove you can work as expected. Put in enough time to repay the employer for their confidence in hiring you and you then apply for your dream jobs, knowing you've got some income at present and your sights can rise on a better fit. 
 Of course you could turn down the job if offered to you just as well. Hey, it happens. I don't suggest you apply and interview for 76 jobs you have zero interest in which is an extreme waste of your time; you only need perhaps one interview with an employer to try an answer to get past your dreaded question. There's no substitute for the real thing. 
 Experience in all its many forms is a good thing. Be they good or bad, every experience is a learning opportunity. Some people will tell you that jobs they took out of necessity and came to dislike or even dread were in some ways good for them. They may have learned to avoid certain kinds of work or work environments, to steer clear of certain kinds of supervisors, or to restrict their job search to a certain distance. The experience of going to interviews is no different as you learn what answers work for you and which don't. 
 Now lest you be alarmed I'm recommending job seekers everywhere to flood employers with applications for jobs they have no interest in at all, I'm not saying this. What I am saying is that in certain situations, and on an individual basis, there are times when it's sound advice to hone your interview skills in a real interview; not for your dream job where you'll feel the extra pressure, but first perhaps in a job with less on the line, so you can prepare yourself for that job of jobs!

 Staying When You're No Longer In It 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  mental health ,  older workers ,  philosophy ,  relationship building 
 I can't help but wonder how many readers of this piece are themselves stuck in a job they really don't enjoy or worse, have come to truly hate; and hate my dear reader, is a very strong word. But that's it isn't it? I mean, knowing you don't enjoy the work, the people who surround you, the company, the commute; and nonetheless hanging on and holding on, going in day after day, week after week, just living for the day when you retire. Oh what sweet release awaits you! 
 You might think this is an extreme comparison, but haven't I rather described a prison sentence? Wow, that's something to think on. Is it worse or only slightly better to realize that unlike my prison analogy, in this case you're walking around with the means to your release in your possession. After all, you only need walk in and resign and you're free. At least in prison you get time off for good behaviour! 
 The reasons for staying may be well documented elsewhere, but for the record, it could be you're feeling too old to be hired elsewhere, the vacation you've accumulated would be reset at two weeks if you moved; your benefits are just too good. Could be you've built up too much of a dependence on your current income to pay for a mortgage, cottage, vacations, kids education, your wardrobe etc. 
 Somewhat ironic that you might feel trapped in a job in part because of the benefits you're receiving when you are no longer benefitting from the work you're doing where you're doing it day after day. What price are you paying with your mental health when you grudgingly drag yourself into your workplace 5 days a week and loathe both the trip there and clock gaze the entire day. This just has to be affecting your personality, your good-nature, your self-esteem and most importantly your self-worth. 
 Self-worth is ironic in and of itself. Look on the internet and you'll find articles about how much some well-know figure is worth. That's dollars and cents; a financial commodity. Were we to ask that same person, (presuming we could even get their attention to ask), how much value they put on the life they are leading, we might get a much lower evaluation. 
 Don't you think it's rather disappointing to know that you've only got this one life and you're spending a great deal of your waking hours surrounded by a place and people you don't really want to be with, doing work that you find no happiness in? Supposing it wasn't you in this situation but rather your child or grandchild, wouldn't you strongly suggest and hope that they'd chuck it in and find something that makes they truly happier? It would make you sad knowing the one you love and care for so much continues to do this. 
 It ultimately comes down to choice doesn't it? Sure it does. It may not be what you want to hear, and you might stop reading right about here, but it is your conscious choice to stay where you are, just as it's an option to walk away. Don't say you've got no choice in this, that you have to stay, for that's not true. What is true is that the reason you've stayed and not quit already is because it's going to need some courage and a struggle of a different kind to actually walk away. 
 Quitting is going to mean job searching, curtailing your expenses until you find another source of income. It might mean you'll get less time off each year for some time. Can you picture how the six weeks off a year vs. the two weeks off a year in a new job, might not be that big of a deal if you enjoy going to work 50 weeks a year instead of loathing the 46 weeks a year as you do now? 
 I mean if you're popping painkillers or self-medicating just to get through your days, are you factoring these things into your decision-making when you look at how you're doing? How much you make a year isn't the only bottom line here; how much you're paying each year to make that money is far more significant. 
 Come on, this isn't the life you dreamed; this isn't how they drew it up for you back in high school or the family home. And by chance if someone did envision this life for you, it is still within YOUR power and control to pack it in. The hardest part is just deciding you're going. Then there is a release; freedom. You'll likely get some package of sorts, and if you don't, it's still more valuable to know you're rekindling your self-esteem than sacrificing it to stay. 
 If you do walk away from this kind of situation, give yourself time - perhaps a month - to decompress. This is a big change after all, and transitioning from that job to the rest of your life is a stage to refocus and indulge in some healing time. 
 Sorry if you decide to stay; really I am. I understand your decision though; even if I'd recommend leaving. I do hope you make it to retirement in relative good health - physically and mentally. For many though, the view of retirement and time to do what they want is actually dictated by the health with which they arrive at it.
