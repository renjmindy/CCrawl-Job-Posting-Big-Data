According to a recently released survey by the  National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) , college juniors pursuing a bachelor's degree in engineering can receive $18.90 per hour as an intern. Other students with technical, quantitative, and scientific majors can also expect to earn at the higher end of the internship wage spectrum with hourly salaries between $17.85 and $18.90. 
 Here's how the internship salaries for college juniors across a variety of majors stack up. 
 Communications, $15.71 
 Marketing, $15.98 
 Business Administration, $16.15 
 Human Resources, $16.26 
 Finance, $16.73 
 Accounting, $16.79 
 Liberal Arts, $16.91 
 Economics, $16.99

 Actuarial Science, $18.44

 In addition, the study reports that offer rates and acceptance rates are the highest they have been for interns in four years, and the conversion rate of interns to full-time employees is reported to be 58 percent, compared to a 47 percent conversion rate in 2007. The study also indicates that interns that become employees have a 76 percent retention rate after one year and a 55 percent retention rate after five years.

 Now Hiring: GM to Add 2,500 Jobs and GE Creates 1,000 Jobs 
 
 General Motors says it will add 2,500 jobs at a Detroit-area plant that now makes the Chevrolet Volt electric car. 
 The company plans to invest $69 million in the Detroit-Hamtramck (Ham-TRAM-ick) factory and add two shifts of workers so the plant can make the new Chevrolet Malibu midsize car and the Impala large sedan. 
 Not all the jobs will be new hires. GM has about 1,300 laid-off workers waiting to be recalled in the U.S. 
 GM announced on May 10 that it would create or keep about 4,000 jobs by investing $2 billion in 17 factories in eight states. 
 So far the company has announced expansion plans in Bowling Green, Ky., Toledo, Ohio, and Flint and Bay City, Mich.

 12 Money-Making Certificates 
 **** Laid off and looking to flee the floundering industry that sent you packing?  Not to worry: Minimum wage work is not your only option. Whether you're in dire need of a new career, trying to earn more at your current gig or you're returning to work after a prolonged hiatus at home with the kids, a certificate program from a community college or vocational school is the swiftest way to pump up your earning potential. "Many people refer to community college as the new master's degree," says Dr. Laurence Shatkin, author of more than a dozen books for job hunters, including 150 Best Recession-Proof Jobs. "It's a way to repurpose yourself." As an added bonus, countless certificate programs train you for cubicle-free jobs - good news for weary office workers who'd like a change of scenery. Certificate programs vary in length, averaging six months to a year, with evening, weekend, and online classes frequently available. Costs range from several hundred to several thousand dollars (happily, financial aid is sometimes offered for those who qualify). Review the list below and make note of which certificate programs appeal to you or build on what you already know. 
 1. Court reporter certificate program. 
 Can you type like the wind? According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, court reporters remain in high demand -- by both the justice system and the television industry, which hires these workers to create closed captioning text.  Average salary: $39,781 a year. 
 2. Auto insurance appraiser certificate program. 
 Appraisers have the best of both worlds: Many split their time between the office and the field, traveling to homes and auto shops to write up repair estimates for crumpled cars. While most work for insurance companies, some are self-employed.  Average salary: $50,165 a year. 
 3. Auto or motorcycle mechanic certificate program. 
 Are you happiest when wielding a wrench? "Mechanic jobs are particularly good in a recession because people are trading in their cars less," Shatkin says. In other words, there's no shortage of clunkers in need of repair.  Average salary: $41,233 a year. 
 4. Massage therapist certificate program. 
 If you think the economy is keeping people from getting a massage, you're wrong. The American Massage Therapy Association found that 36 percent of Americans got a massage to relieve stress in 2008, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics expects these jobs to increase by 20 percent before 2016.  Average salary: $35,349 a year. 
 5. Security and fire alarm system installer certificate program. 
 Do you live to tinker with electronic devices? Then installing, maintaining, and repairing residential and commercial alarm systems might be the ideal career for you. Most installation work requires driving to various job sites each day.  Average salary: $42,763 a year. 
 6. Emergency medical technician certificate program. 
 Why sit at a desk all day when you could be out there saving lives? Despite the recession, people will continue to "crash their cars and have heart attacks in the middle of the night," reminds Shatkin. EMT certification requirements vary by state.  Average salary: $30,530 a year. 
 7. Aerobics or fitness instructor certificate program. 
 If you're already a workout fiend, why not get paid for pumpin' it up? Job openings for exercise instructors are expected to increase by 25 percent over the next decade, Shatkin says, with most located at health clubs and fitness centers.  Average salary: $37,113 a year. 
 8. Medical transcriptionist certificate program. 
 With healthcare the fastest-growing job sector, there's plenty of work for those who can decipher and type up the audio recordings doctors make about their patients. While a majority of transcriptionists work in a hospital or doctor's office, many telecommute from home.  Average salary: $31,286 a year. 
 9. Cosmetologist certificate program. 
 Are you the person everyone calls for beauty advice? Then why not go pro? Cosmetologists are trained to cut, style, and chemically treat hair, as well as to treat skin and nails. Bonus: Schedules are flexible and self-employment is common.  Average salary: $27,112 a year. 
 10. Language interpreter certificate program. 
 Maybe you grew up speaking two languages or picked one up while traveling abroad. If so, hospitals, courtrooms, and social service agencies need your help. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, one in five interpreters works for themselves, and many work part time. Plus, oftentimes, only a one-day exam is needed to be certified.  Average salary: $44,175 a year. 
 11. Sign language interpreter certificate program. 
 If you enjoy working with others in multiple settings -- from live performances and business conferences to schools and social service agencies -- translating the spoken word for the deaf could be the job for you.  Average salary: $36,278 a year. 
 12. Embalmer certificate program. 
 Preparing the dead for their final resting place isn't for everyone. But for those with a strong constitution, there's job security in the funeral business -- people won't stop dying simply because the economy's taken a turn for the worse.  Average salary: $38,482 a year.  Source: All salary data is from PayScale. The salaries listed are median, annual salaries for full-time workers with 5-8 years of experience and include any bonuses, commissions or profit sharing. -------------------  By Michelle Goodman, PayScale

 Careers that Earn You $40 per Hour 
 A $40-per-hour job provides an annual income of around $83,200. Not bad at all. How do you get to that level of earnings? Look at healthcare and IT jobs. You’ll likely need a degree and a good amount of training to get hired. But, if you’re looking to start a new job path and are willing to spend some time to prepare, the following careers will pay off. 
 1. Dental Hygienist  - $33.19 -$41.92 
 A science-minded people person could shine in this job. Dental hygienist is one of the fastest-growing careers in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). One suspected reason is that, to cover costs, dentists are relying more and more on hygienists to carry the workload with patients. A high school diploma and college-entrance exam scores will get you into many two-year dental hygiene degree programs. Some programs require a year of college courses in science as a prerequisite. State licensure is also required after you graduate. 
 2. Physical Therapist  (PT) - $34.74 - $45.00 
 As more baby boomers need help recovering from surgery and maintaining their mobility over the years, physical therapy is a career field that will grow. This job can offer flexible hours, and it allows you to work with people of all ages. Most physical therapists work in clinics or hospitals. Getting into a physical therapy career requires completing a bachelor’s degree, preferably in a science-related major, then earning a master’s or doctoral degree at an accredited institution. Further exams and licensure are typically needed, but the requirements vary somewhat by state. 
 3.  Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP)  - $36.55 - $61.08 
 From stopping stuttering to reducing accents, speech-language pathologists help people with challenging speech problems get closer to “normal” speech. Many speech-language pathologists work in educational settings, while others work in healthcare or social assistance settings. They assess a patient’s issues, design a treatment plan and often collaborate with teachers and parents to ensure that the treatment plan is followed. A master’s degree is the standard level of education amongst speech-language pathologists, as well as licensure in most states. 
 4. Software Developer  - $36.66 - $61.29 
 Employment for software developers is expected to grow 21 percent by 2018, making it one of the fastest growing careers in the U.S. Software developers need to have plenty of technical knowledge and be able to write code for computer software. They also must think creatively and find ways to solve problems so that the computer games, business applications and operating systems they design work well for the end user. This job can offer flexible, though often long, hours. Employers tend to look for applicants with a bachelor’s degree in a computer-science-related area and good knowledge of computer systems and technology. That said, a two-year degree can sometimes get you work if you’re able to prove yourself. 
 5. Certified Nurse Midwife  - $37.42 - $51.25 
 Want a career with meaning? If you’re interested in supporting healthy mothers and healthy babies, working as a nurse midwife will give you plenty of opportunity to make a difference in the world. Be prepared to hit the books, first, though. Your best route to this career is to complete an undergraduate degree in nursing, then attend a certified nurse midwifery school. You will need to complete a written examination at the end of your training. At that point you will be an advance practice registered nurse who can work with an obstetrician to assist women before, during and after labor. 
 6. Industrial Designer  - $30.52 - $48.72 
 Who’s behind the look and function of your external hard drive, television, new power tool and electronic toothbrush? An industrial designer. Industrial designers work on a large range of manufactured products, though individual designers often focus on a certain type of product. Designers work closely with engineers, materials scientists, marketing and corporate strategy staff, cost estimators, and accountants to produce the final product. Competition is stiff to get into this industry. A bachelor’s degree in a related area, like economics or engineering, is essential, and increasingly, designers are pursuing MBA degrees so they can assist in the business strategy around their designs. 
 7. Senior Web Developer  - $39.03 - $66.28 
 Web developers are responsible for the technical aspects of website creation. Developers use software and other tools to create applications for the Web. They oversee a site’s production and implementation. A senior web developer is able to lead a team of web developers on a large project, taking full responsibility for the final product. Getting into this field requires, at the very least, an associate’s degree and a professional certification. To advance to a management role, you’ll likely find more opportunities with a bachelor’s degree in a computer-related field. 
 8. Business Systems Analyst  - $38.45 - $52.53 
 Here is a job for someone who loves maximizing profits and minimizing waste. A business systems analyst takes a look at a whole company, or a division of it, and works on making that organization more streamlined and profitable. Some business analysts specialize in technology while others focus on marketing or overall strategy. Questions they might address include: How much of a financial risk should the business be taking with its next product line? Should it be hiring, firing or keeping the same team? To get into this field you likely need at least a bachelor’s degree but, as you develop in your career, a master’s degree or some specialized training will likely be needed. Degrees in accounting, marketing, management and engineering can all support a business systems analyst career. 
 9. Veterinarian  - $40.76 - $66.05 
 Do you love dogs, goats, cows and kittens? A career in veterinary medicine can put you right in the middle of the animal kingdom treating everything from upset stomachs to blood cancers. Veterinarians also sometimes contribute to research on treating human illnesses. The majority of veterinarians work for themselves in private practice. Competition to get into veterinary school is stiff. You’ll need a bachelor’s degree to apply. And, you’ll graduate with a Doctorate in Veterinary Medicine. After that, a licensing test is required to start working. This test varies from state to state. 
 10. Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner (ARNP)  - $38.91 - $54.51 
 Besides working in large, urban hospitals and bustling medical clinics, an advanced registered nurse practitioner can work as a main, medical care provider in a rural area of the country where doctors are in short supply. ARNPs examine patients, run diagnostic tests, prescribe medicines and therapy, assist with minor surgeries and more. Their on-the-job training is extensive and they must complete either a master’s or a doctorate degree, as well as passing a board certification exam. Finally, they must also be licensed in their state.

 Now Hiring: 10,000 Walmart Jobs in the Chicago Area 
  Walmart has big plans for job creation in Illinois. The massive retailer just  announced  two new Chicago area stores that will boost the company to the projected creation of 10,000 jobs in the area by 2015.  Walmart  is planning the newly announced small and mid-size stores in the West Englewood community, which is reported to be the heart of a "food desert" and one of Chicago's most under-served communities by large grocery stores. These new stores, combined with the company's existing projects, will create close to 1,000 new jobs and nearly 200  construction jobs . Walmart's currently slated openings in Chicago include the following: 
 
 A Supercenter in Pullman at 111th St. and South Doty Ave. (opening spring 2013) 
 A Supercenter in West Chatham at 83rd St. and Stewart Ave. (opening spring 2012) 
 S Walmart Market in the West Loop at West Monroe St. and South Jefferson St. (opening fall 2011) 
 A Walmart Market in West Englewood at West 76th St. and South Ashland Ave. (opening spring 2012) 
 A Walmart Express in West Englewood at South Western Ave. and West 71st St. (opening winter 2012) 
 A Walmart Express in West Chatham at 83rd St. and Stewart Ave. (opening summer 2011) 
 
 #mini_module_blank { width: 269px; height: 206px; border: medium none; float: left; margin: 18px; font-size: 12px; }#mini_module_blank img { width: 265px; height: 131px; border: medium none; margin: 0px; }#mini_module_blank .mini_main { margin: 0px; padding: 0px; width: 269px; height: 206px; background: url(" http://www.aolcdn.com/travel/zing-background-no-photo&#8221 ;) repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent; }#mini_module_blank .mini_item_header { padding: 12px 0px; margin: 0px 20px; font-size: 16px; }#mini_module_blank .mini_item { padding: 8px 0px; margin: 0px 20px; border-bottom: 1px dotted rgb(204, 204, 204); }#mini_module_blank a { color: rgb(73, 163, 202); text-decoration: none; }#mini_module_blank a:hover { color: rgb(249, 132, 25); text-decoration: underline; } The Walmart Express stores are a relatively new concept. They'll be less than 30,000 sq. ft and will sell grocery, pharmacy and limited general merchandise. Walmart Market previously called Neighborhood Market will range in size from 30,000 to 60,000 sq. ft. and provide a wider assortment of fresh groceries, as well as a bakery and delicatessen. The Walmart Supercenter is intended to be a one-stop shopping destination, offering full service grocery as well as a wide range of general merchandise. 
 In June 2010, Walmart announced the "Chicago Community Investment Partnership," a five-year plan to open several dozen stores, create approximately 10,000 jobs and 2,000 unionized construction jobs, generate more than $500 million in sales and property taxes and develop charitable partnerships worth $20 million. 
 "When I met with Walmart last year, I encouraged them to take an approach that addressed the needs of the urban shopper if they truly wanted to make a difference in our underserved neighborhoods," said Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. "Today, it appears that Walmart has done just that by creating smaller urban store formats that will better serve our communities." 
 Jobs at some of these stores won't be available for a year or two, but to find out about specific openings right now, visit the  Walmart Careers site .
