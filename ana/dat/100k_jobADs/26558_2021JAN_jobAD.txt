 The Friday Poem 'The Question' by Karla Kuskin 
 December 16, 2017 Eileen Kohan   Leave a comment 
 Before poetry was printed on the back of NYC Metro Cards, there was 'Poetry in Motion', a joint effort of the MTA and the Poetry Society of America. Between October, 1992 and August, 1997 commuters, families and tourists could sample poems, reading from the placards displayed in subway cars and buses. 
 _" Poetry in Motion®  places poetry in the transit systems of cities throughout the country, _ helping to create a national readership for both emerging and established poets. " 
 The Friday Poem this week was one of those selected for the inaugural NYC program: 'The Question' by  Karla Kuskin . In this holiday season, revisit career choice through the eyes of your younger self. 
 The Question 
 People always say to me 
"What do you think you'd like to be 
When you grow up?" 
And I say, "Why, 
I think I'd like to be the sky 
Or be a plane or train or mouse 
Or maybe a haunted house 
Or something furry, rough and wild… 
Or maybe I will stay a child." 
 Karla Kuskin  'Poetry in Motion: 100 Poems From the Subways and Buses'  1996

 What should I do with my life? (in brackets) 
 March 14, 2017 Eileen Kohan   Leave a comment 
 The new president has declined to participate in March Madness this year. No filling in blank spaces to arrive at a prediction of the men's NCAA basketball champion. Maybe he's just looking at it the wrong way. 'Bracketology' is simply a means to eliminate options to arrive at the best decision. 
 Completing a NCAA bracket is the perfect 'trial run' for the other major decision we face - what should I do with my life? 
 With a little imagination, you can use the bracket concept as a decision matrix to manage career choice, job search or your network. 
 In 2007, sportswriters  Richard Sandomir  and  Mark Reiter  published  ‘The Enlightened Bracketologist: The Final Four of Everything’ , applying the methodology of March Madness to everyday decisions. 
 “Bracketology—the practice of parsing people, places, and things into discrete one-on-one matchups to determine which of the two is superior or preferable—works because it is simple. It is a system that helps us make clearer and cleaner decisions about what is good, better, best in our world. What could be simpler than breaking down a choice into either/or, black or white, this one or that one?” 
 How can we apply the scaffolding of March Madness to job search? Let’s say you are totally undecided (confused, terrified, ambivalent) about your next career move. All you know is you’re not happy with your current work situation. Where do you begin? 
 Try categorizing your interests using the bracket system. Instead of four regions, fill in four career fields that might interest you. Next, identify sixteen possible employers in each field. Once you have your potential employer roster identified, begin your research. 
 This may be a good time to develop a parallel list of contacts: a bracket representing your network. Use the same four career categories and identify folks who have broad expertise in the profession. In this ‘exploration’ phase you are aggregating data about industry trends, market leaders, and potential for growth. 
 As you progress with your data gathering, you will begin to eliminate some organizations in favor of others. Once you get to your ‘elite eight’ employers, schedule your in-depth information interviews. 
 As you talk to people you will begin to establish a realistic assessment of ‘organization fit’, and evaluate your chances for success. 
 The ‘elite eight’ forms your target list. By the time you have narrowed your selection to eight, you should feel comfortable that each employer presents a realistic starting point in the next phase your career. 
 As with any selection process, you don’t have total control. The employer extends the offer and you have the choice to accept or continue to pursue other options. 
 The NCAA tournament lasts three weeks. If you start filling in your career brackets now, you will advance through the exploration process at a pace to be ready for interviews by ‘tip-off’ in the championship game. 
 Its time to add a little ‘March Madness’ to your job search, and some fun to a typically stressful routine.

 The week@work - end of summer, Wells Fargo issues an apology to artists, start-ups adapt, cycling is the new networking, and the August jobs report 
 September 5, 2016September 5, 2016 Eileen Kohan   Leave a comment 
 In news this week@work: Wells Fargo placed advertising in advance of 'Teen Financial Education Day' implying the worth of career aspirations in the sciences rank above those in the arts, Silicon Valley start-ups are adapting to anticipate a market downturn, networking has moved from the bar to the bike (that's a good thing), and the U.S. unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.9%. 
 Late Saturday morning I checked my Twitter feed and found this from novelist  Caroline Leavitt . Forget post-tropical cyclone Hermine, this was the Labor Day weekend's perfect storm. 
 
 REALLY  @WellsFargo ? Insensitive/wrong. How about former banker nownovelist? the passion of doing what you love.Shame  pic.twitter.com/cug4WmmL4a 
 -- Caroline Leavitt (@Leavittnovelist)  September 3, 2016 
 
 According to  Forbes  contributing writer,  Emily Willingham ,  " Wells Fargo rolled out an ad campaign this week that it almost immediately withdrew following on Internet outrage from a lot of angry artists and humanities professors. That may not sound that scary, but these folks know how to use words and emote. 
 The ads, using images depicting teens engaging in sciencey things, urge us to “get them ready for tomorrow” by ensuring that the aspiring ballerinas and actors of today become engineers and botanists of the future … 
 The message here is, of course, that the future is science. That becoming a ballerina or an actor is a dreamscape fairytale that has no place in a real world of cold hard cash and sciencey-sounding things like botany. Imagine if some parents buy into that ad’s message and try to push their budding ballerina into botany instead. The world loses an artist and gains a mediocre, uninterested botanist who’s given up her life’s dream? Lose–lose. " 
 This was not just a 'business section' story.  Olivia Clement  reported on Broadway's reaction on  Playbill.com . 
 " A new advertising campaign from Wells Fargo, an American banking and financial services company, has prompted outrage from the theatre community. The ads imply that it is more valuable for young people to pursue a career in the sciences rather than the arts. 
 A Wells Fargo brochure depicts a young man in a science lab. “An actor yesterday. A botanist today. Let’s get them ready for tomorrow,” reads the accompanying text. Another, depicting a young woman in a lab, reads: “A ballerina yesterday. An engineer today.” 
 Among those to express their disappointment and frustration at the campaign on September 3 were Alex Brightman, Ann Harada, Cynthia Erivo, Heather Headley and Benj Pasek—who took to Twitter to call out the company directly. “Apparently @WellsFargo doesn’t think that an actor or ballerina require any work at all. Shame!” read Erivo’s tweet. " 
 Wells Fargo apologized via Twitter late Saturday. 
 
 We offer our sincere apology for the initial ads promoting our Sept. 17 Teen Financial Education Day.  pic.twitter.com/1QgFupxN3j

 Anticipating the end of the boom,  Katie Benner  delivered a tech industry status report,  'Warned of a Crash, Start-Ups in Silicon Valley Narrow Their Focus'. 
 " Last year, many tech executives, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs were convinced that a multiyear boom that had propelled young companies to great heights could no longer sustain itself. 
 The worst fallout may yet come, but many of the start-ups have hung on. Across Silicon Valley, engineers are still commanding annual salaries that average $136,000, according to Hired, a recruiting firm. Demand is brisk for $4 buttered toast, and office space rents remain near record highs. The biggest start-ups, like Uber and Airbnb, continue to land billions of dollars in funding. And investors are shoveling money into venture capital funds, which raised so much cash in the first half of this year that it rivaled the amount raised in all of 2015. 
 For all of the hand-wringing, “there just hasn’t been much of a downturn,” said Paul Buchheit, a managing partner at Y Combinator, a prominent start-up incubator that nurtured companies including Dropbox and Airbnb. “I don’t even see many companies going out of business.” 
 Wondering where you might meet one of those tech execs or VCs? This past week  Sarah Max  covered a story that has been  growing globally  over the past year,  'Cycling Matches the Pace and Pitches of Tech' . In other words, cycling is the new networking. 
 " Thinking he needed to take up a “California sport,” Greg Gretsch started cycling in 1988, when he moved to the Bay Area to work in marketing at Apple after graduating from the University of Georgia. He bought a 10-speed road bike and joined a group of other Apple employees for a standing noon ride. 
 Today, Mr. Gretsch, 49, is a founding partner with San Francisco-based Jackson Square Ventures, which makes early-stage investments in fledgling companies, including a social network and performance-tracking app for athletes call Strava. He rides an average of five days a week on paved roads in the Bay Area and on trails near his second home near Lake Tahoe. Cycling is primarily for exercise and escape, he said, but it has also been good for his career. 
 “Connecting with people is important to what I do, and you can learn a lot about a person, and from a person, on the bike,” said Mr. Gretsch, who founded three companies before going into venture capital in 2000 at a firm called Sigma Partners. " 
 On Friday, the U.S. Labor Department released the August jobs report.  Camila Domonoske  summarized  the data for NPR. 
 " The U.S. added 151,000 new jobs in August and the unemployment rate held steady at 4.9 percent, according to the monthly jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 Both those metrics fell short of expectations: Economists were expecting about 180,000 new jobs, and a slight dip in the unemployment rate, to 4.8 percent …" 
 Finally, this week@work, we celebrated the last weekend of summer.

 "Discover who you are - not who you are supposed to be" Larry Ellison@USC 
 May 17, 2016May 17, 2016 Eileen Kohan   Leave a comment 
 In all the meetings I have had with folks about career choice, the number one topic, by a landslide, is how to manage the expectations of others: family members, mentors, friends and colleagues. 
 "My parents want me to major in 'x', and apply to 'y', but my passion is in 'z'. How do I get them to understand my decision?" 
 On Friday, at the University of Southern California,  Larry Ellison  drew on his personal experience to  address  the topic. I hope the parents were listening. I guarantee members of the Class of 2016 were texting quotes. 
 He began where most career conversations start. Recalling his early aspirations to attend USC Medical School, he began to realize that his family's conviction that he become a doctor was not his own.  " Their dreams became my dreams." 
 And it wasn't long before he  " became painfully aware that he couldn't make himself study something that didn't interest me." 
 The power of parental/family influence on career choice can provide either a scaffolding of support or a detour of unending disappointments. 
 Here's the thing, the next great innovation is yet to be discovered. The next emerging market is yet to be identified. Categories of new job titles are yet to be defined. 
 So we fall back on what we know, and what society values as acceptable professions. 
 In Ellison's narrative, he dropped out of college and took on a  " a couple of jobs I loved and one that was fun" : river guide, rock climbing instructor and computer programmer. It was in the world of technology that he found the link to the same kind of satisfaction he had found solving math problems and playing chess. 
 But as he incrementally travelled toward his dream job, he found he was unable to live up to the expectations of others. 
 At the urging of his wife, he returned to college, to pursue his degree. The only course he remembered was a sailing class at Berkeley. The beginning of his love affair with the Pacific Ocean marked the end of the one with his wife, who viewed him as irresponsible, and lacking in ambition.  " She kicked me out, and then she divorced me." 
 " This was a pivotal moment in my life… Once again, I was unable to live up to the expectations of others. 
 But this time I was not disappointed in myself for failing to be the person they thought I should be. Their dreams and my dreams were different. I would never confuse the two of them again. 
 I had discovered things that I loved: the Sierras, Yosemite, the Pacific Ocean. These natural wonders brought me great joy and happiness, and would for the rest of my life. I had an interesting job programming computers and more money than I needed. 
 For the first time I was certain I was going to survive in this world. 
 A huge burden of fear had been lifted. I 'll never forget that moment. It was a time for rejoicing." 
 Ellison's career path accelerated along the trajectory of Silicon Valley's early days, as he tried to find a job he loved as much as sailing. He founded Oracle Corporation, built on his 'crazy idea' of constructing a commercialized relational database, and the rest is  history . 
 I spent thirteen years on the USC campus, working with students and alumni as they wrestled with career decisions and connected the mosaic of past experience into a plan for the future. There is no better advice for folks@work or those just starting out than the  shared wisdom  of Mr. Ellison. 
 " Each of you has a chance to discover who you are and not who you are supposed to be. 
 Don’t be afraid to experiment, and try lots of different things. And don’t let the experts discourage you when you challenge the status quo.”

 The Saturday Read 'Every Time I Find the Meaning of Life, They Change It' by Daniel Klein 
 November 21, 2015December 3, 2015 Eileen Kohan   Leave a comment 
 A U.S. Senator, a philosophy student and a welder walk into a bar…maybe not. In a debate last week U.S. Senator Marco Rubio questioned the value of a philosophy major in a world that needs more welders. 
 " I don't know why we have stigmatized vocational education, welders make more money than philosophers. We need more welders and less philosophers.” 
 I can understand those who seek to define college as an extended vocational school experience, given the cost and potential for significant debt, but to limit the aspirations of 18 year olds diminishes the value of higher education. I think we go to college to figure things out. Part of that is the career decision, but the larger experience incorporates learning how to think, question, listen, reflect and argue in a quest to live our best life. 
 In defense of philosophy majors, and the politicians and welders who might benefit from their wisdom, The Saturday Read this week is ' Every Time I Find the Meaning of Life, They Change It: Wisdom of the Great Philosophers on How to Live'  by  Daniel Klein . 
 Like many college students, Klein  "   didn 't have a clue as to what I wanted to do after college; basically all I knew was that I didn't want to be a doctor, lawyer, or businessman, eliminations that put me in a distinct minority of my classmates. I figured studying philosophy would be just the ticket to give me direction." 
 His father, like Senator Rubio, let him know that  " studying philosophy was simply a wast of time." 
 Fortunately for the reader, Klein continued his studies, recording selected 'Pithies' in a notebook hoping _" to find some guidance from the great philosophers on how best to live my life." _These quotes and current reflections form the structure of the book. 
 " I now realized that those how-to-live questions were still very much alive in my mind. Sure, time had crept on and my life, with its ups and downs, had simply happened, as lives tend to do, by my appetite for philosophical ideas about life had not diminished in the least. In fact, as I look at life from the vantage point of my eighth decade, my hankering for such ideas has only increased. Late in the game as it may be, I still want to live my final years the best way I can. But more compellingly, I find myself at that stage of life when I want to give my personal history one last look-through, and I am curious to see how it measures up to fully considered ideas of a good life." 
 Why this book? Because legislating, welding and philosophy should not be mutually exclusive terms. As the Thanksgiving inter-generational conversation turns to the big 'vocational' questions of choice and what you are doing with your life, it's the central question of philosophy being posed, how to live the best possible life. 
 'Every Time I Find the Meaning of Life, They Change It' is an accessible, often humorous, tutorial, presenting a pageant of philosophy's luminaries and author commentaries. 
 One quote in particular, resonated with me in light of the domestic and international scene this week, from British philosopher,  Bertrand Russell . 
 _" The man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense, from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation, and from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the co-operation or consent of deliberate reason. To such a man the world tends to become definite, finite, obvious; common objects rouse no questions, and unfamiliar possibilities are contemptuously rejected…(But Philosophy) keeps alive ours sense of wonder by showing familiar things in an unfamiliar _ aspect.

 'Vocation' a poem by Sandra Beasley 
 October 9, 2015October 9, 2015 Eileen Kohan   Leave a comment 
 How many times have you asked someone, What would you like to do next @work? And how often have your received the response, "I'm not sure, but I would like to work with people". It can be the beginning of an extremely frustrating conversation because there are many ways you can work with people and not all of them pleasant. 
 The Friday Poem this week is from poet  Sandra Beasley's  Barnard Women Poets Prize winning poetry collection, 'I Was the Jukebox'. In reading the poem, what caught my eye was the twist on the 'working with people' ambition in the last lines of the poem. 
 Her words give voice to all of us who struggle to find our perfect place @work. 
 " If it calls you, its your calling, right?" 
 Maybe there's more to career choice than hearing voices. 
 Vocation 
 For six months I dealt Baccarat in a casino. 
For six months I played Brahms in a mall. 
For six months I arranged museum dioramas; 
my hands were too small for the Paleolithic 
and when they reassigned me to lichens, I quit. 
I type ninety-one words per minute, all of them 
Help. Yes, I speak Dewey Decimal. 
I speak Russian, Latin, a smattering of Tlingit. 
I can balance seven dinner plates on my arm. 
All I want to do is sit on a veranda while 
a hard rain falls around me. I’ll file your 1099s. 
I’ll make love to strangers of your choice. 
I’ll do whatever you want, as long as I can do it 
on that veranda. If it calls you, it’s your calling, 
right? Once I asked a broker what he loved 
about his job, and he said Making a killing. 
Once I asked a serial killer what made him 
get up in the morning, and he said The people. 
 Sandra Beasley  'I Was the Jukebox: Poems'  2010

 What do you want to be when you grow up? 
 October 1, 2015 Eileen Kohan   Leave a comment 
 Where do the remnants of your childhood dreams reside? In the back of a closet? In a pile of boxes in a storage locker? In the memory of a childhood hero? Or, is there a kernel of that imagined life germinating in your days @work? 
 When we get stuck in our careers it makes sense to step back and imagine our work in the eyes of a five year old. Most of us are probably not dressed in the costumes of our earliest aspirations, but taking a look back at a photo of our pre-school self might provide the starting point for redirecting our career GPS. 
 We spend a lot of time in our lives fulfilling the expectations of others. In school we excel to please teachers and parents, we compete to attend the 'right' college to impress our peers, and we contend with other candidates to land the 'best' job offer. The process can become an end in itself, and one day we are sitting at our desk wondering how we arrived. 
 Rewind. What did you want to be when you grew up? Is there an element of that wish that links to the career decision maker you are today? 
 Maybe the opportunity to be the prima ballerina with the New York City Ballet is no longer an option, but could your dream of the dance connect with an alternative artistic career choice? 
 Start with small steps. Talk to people who actually are @work in your imagined dream job. What's the reality? Could you test your interest with an internship or volunteer experience before you abandon your current source of revenue? 
 When we are young our career fantasies are limitless. We haven't encountered any opposition to our imagination. That picture of our five year old self is a 'screen shot' of us before brick walls. Adults didn't take our plans too seriously and encouraged our wildest dreams. 
 Now, you are the adult, looking at the photo of yourself BBW (before brick walls). What has happened over time between that image and today's selfie? Maybe it's time for the two of you to have a conversation about what's next.
