  What To Consider Before Relocating For A Job  
 Paula Munch 
 January 06, 2017 
 Thinking about relocating for a job? Read this first...  I have a friend who was out of work for more than a few months. A job offer became available more than a few states away. Needing the job badly, he took it. After the company paid him to fly back and forth for a year (a great perk!), he now finds himself commuting every Monday and Friday – a drive that takes more than five hours. During the week, he stays in budget hotels and is away from his family. He did not permanently relocate to the new city for a few reasons. First, he had a hard time selling his house, and second, his wife did not want to give up her career or home. Relocating for a job can be hard, but sometimes it's the best option. As great as it is to have a job, my friend is sacrificing a lot commuting back and forth each week. So, as a job seeker, there are a few things to think about before accepting that job that is hours away. 
 Are you sure this is the job for you? 
 Is the job something that you are willing to sacrifice for? It is worth a move for your family, new school for the kids, or worth having a spouse leave their job? Something to think about. 
 What is the cost of living where you are going? 
 Is it better or worse? Are real estate or rental prices better, worse, or comparable? Do the research and know – you want to make sure that where you are going is affordable. 
 Will the new employer pick up any relocation costs? 
 If you are lucky, some companies will help with moving expenses and commuting costs (for a certain amount of time). Use this wisely, so when the benefit runs out you will be settled in the new area. 
 Is this where you want to be? 
 Sometimes, people pick jobs out of desperation and move to an area away from friends and family. Think hard before you say yes to this job. Check with your family to make sure everyone is on board. With a little thought and some strategic planning, relocating for a job might be the best thing. Just make sure it is.
