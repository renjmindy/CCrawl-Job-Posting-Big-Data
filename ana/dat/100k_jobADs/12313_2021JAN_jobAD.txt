You will be responsible for a headcount of 25-30 spanning across team leaders and process operatives. 
 It is imperative that you have a strong numerical background and can deliver on KPI's set by the senior management team. Your day to day will consist of morning & afternoon meetings which will enable you to be close to the team in order to drive success. Given the industry it is desirable you have worked with a variety of batch work consisting of 1-5 offs up to 125-150 offs. Given the activity on the shop floor it is essential you have worked in a heavy manufacturing industry within either a forging / machining facility.
