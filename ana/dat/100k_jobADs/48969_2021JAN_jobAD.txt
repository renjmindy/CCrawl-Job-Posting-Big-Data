 Job: Manager, Collections & Information Services 
 Posted on  October 26, 2017  by   sarahgprescott 
 10.25.17 –  Manager, Collections & Information Services 
KAUST (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology)Thuwal, Saudi Arabia 
 Sarah P.’s comment  : Be very careful of accepting a contract in Saudi Arabia. I worked in Saudi Arabia and did actually enjoy my time there. However I did my research before I applied. While there are some reputable companies, colleges, and schools please be aware that you are at the mercy of the institution which hires you. KAUST has very mixed reviews and like many places in Saudi, was started with great promise and has fallen, especially with the recent economic downturn there (this is the first time job to be posted since May of 2016). If you do apply know that it is a long and tedious process with very little logic as to who is chosen. Google ‘Kaust’ and ‘reviews’ for more info.
