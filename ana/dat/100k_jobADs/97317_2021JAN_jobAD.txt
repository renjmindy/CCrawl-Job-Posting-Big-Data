 How to Land Your Dream Job 
 Jan 27, 2016 
 Career, Goals, Human Capital 
 I don’t need to tell you why it would be amazing if you were able to land that dream job. Maybe it’s more pay. Maybe it’s exactly the type of work you love that wouldn’t feel like work at all. Or maybe it’s with a company that has created a culture that you know would allow you to do your very best work in the most awesome of environments. It’s possible that your dream job offers all of these opportunities. So if you’re currently looking for a new job or you’re starting to consider new possibilities, here are some quick and dirty tips on how to land your dream job, fast! 
 • Create your own job description  Without even looking to see what jobs are available out there, write down the exact job that you want. What company or companies would you be working for? What role would you have? What is your list of responsibilities? How would you be compensated and what other benefits would be offered? Knowing exactly what you want is exactly where you need to start if you are going to land your dream job. You’ll save a lot of time and energy by not wasting time applying for positions that don’t meet your criteria. We aren’t talking about landing just any job, after all. Stay focused on your big goal, here. 
 • Craft your unique narrative  You are more than a bulleted list of accomplishments on a resume. There is a story behind those titles, years and lists. What is it? Know it. Practice it. You have a unique story to share and your ability to be able to translate that story on paper or in person and how it relates to the dream position you’re after will help you in every way possible. Be captivating and make it memorable. People love stories. Make yours count. 
 • Plant seeds  You have over 500 connections on LinkedIn and even more across all your social channels and personal contact list. Make personal contact and share your story with them. Let them know what you’re looking for. Let them be another set of eyes and ears for you. You just never know when an opportunity might arise that may never get posted to a job board. Plant some seeds with your contacts and see what sprouts! 
 • Write an individualized cover letter, every time  It can be tempting to skip out on writing the cover letter that is usually optional on online application forms. Don’t. Think of your resume as your highlight reel of facts and figures. Your cover letter, on the other hand, is where you are able to say whatever you want to say to the hiring manager. Take the time to say something worth reading! Use your cover letter to make a great positive first impression. Let it show how capable and ready you are for your dream position. Make it impossible for them to ignore the great candidate you are for the position.

 • Make a (positive) splash on social media  According to  CareerBuilder’s annual social media recruitment study , the number of employers researching applicants online has steadily risen over the past few years. Fifty-two percent of employers use social networking sites to research job candidates, up significantly from 43 percent last year and 39 percent in 2013. Knowing this, it’s critical that your social media accounts are up to date and quickly showcase your value and good character. Let your social media presence be a reason the hiring manager calls you. Don’t post anything that may give the hiring manager of your dream job pause. The way you showcase yourself online matters, significantly. 
 • Be yourself  Be your honest self and let the best version of you shine through. Remain professional, but allow your personality and enthusiasm to come across to the hiring manager of your dream job. Cultural fit is a huge consideration for companies these days and your best bet is to remain authentic throughout the entire process. No matter what stage you’re at, it’s never too late to find your dream job or even create it for yourself. Knowing what you want and then doing everything you can to achieve it is a recipe for success. “Our truest life is when we are in dreams awake.” - Henry David Thoreau
