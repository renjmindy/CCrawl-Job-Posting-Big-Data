  5 Ways To Spring Your Job Hunt Forward  
 Arnie Fertig 
 April 05, 2013 
 The spring days are getting longer and warmer, flowers are sprouting, and recent economic reports show signs that the economy is bouncing back to life at long last. Now is the time to dispense with winter's funk, take a breath of fresh air, and put some spring into your step. In your actions and personality, you can reflect the sense of newness and possibility inherent in this season. Here are five ways you can use this season to spring forward your job hunt: 
 
 1. Embrace the process . Put simply, it takes a lot of work to get work. It would be great if you could just post a resume on a job board, have your skills and accomplished noticed, and be recruited for the job of your dreams. Sometimes it happens like that, but less than 10 percent of jobs get filled this way. Instead, for the vast majority, this method is nothing more than a lazy person's pipe dreamTake a fresh look at what you have been doing. Ask yourself: "What has been working, what isn't working, and what can stand some improvement?" With this insight, you can successfully reboot your job hunt. If you embrace the process of establishing a solid strategy, building your personal brand, targeting jobs that you're highly qualified for, networking in-person, and working social networks like LinkedIn, you will energize your hunt. 
 All kinds of activities spring to life at this season. Now is the time of year when companies get serious about hiring. Many other kinds of groups and organizations take advantage of this time between winter’s weather making scheduling difficult, and extensive summer family travel and vacations cram the calendar with all kinds of events. In my U.S. News & World Report article, I provide five season-sensitive activities for you to capitalize upon this spring. Learn how by embracing the job hunt process, responding positively to the success of others, volunteering, and two other key activities can  spring your job search forward . Happy hunting!
