 Hi! I want to quickly set up a website for a real estate consultant company. I want something VERY simple (see example1).  This project shouldn't take longer than 6 hours (the example website my old guy did within 4 hours). 
 Pictures can be taken for google and the different tabs I want is only the following ones: 
- Home 
- Consultant service: For example(Sales & Marketing, Strategy, Customer Experience) 
- About Us 
- Case study 
- Partners 
- Contact 
 
 Inspirational website 
 
 
 http://www.realestateconsultancy.co.uk/ 
 https://www.stratosphere-ltd.com/ 
 
 I mainly want the website to be good enough for a quick over view. I need the website to be done within Wednesday/Thursday. 
 Example1:  https://www.stratosphere-ltd.com/ 
Example2:  https://www.bain.com/industry-expertise/infrastructure-construction-building-products/real-estate/

 Software Developer for fast growing start-up 
 Published: Last month  Bids: 7 
 At Torre ( http://torre.co) , we're building the platform and network to power the future of recruitment and we believe making full use of advanced AI is the best way to do so. It's an ambitious effort (view our deck  https://torre.docsend.com/view/c6pecie).  We've made significant progress and we're gaining solid traction (you're experiencing it right now!). 
To get there, we need to build an amazing product. To both accelerate and deal with our growth, we're looking for former tech entrepreneurs for the Senior Software Engineer role. 
 Compensation depends on the candidate's technical and entrepreneurial experience (therefore, the wide range we offer). All roles get stock options. 
 We hire entrepreneurs because they have an innate inclination to do whatever it takes to succeed. Entrepreneurs have a passion for taking calculated risks. In fact, most senior members of our team are former entrepreneurs. 
 If you recently left the company you founded, but you still like being entrepreneurial, working alongside some of the best practitioners in their field, rising to meet significant challenges, paying great attention to detail, and leading others to their full potential, this opportunity is for you.
