 Living and working in Nanjing 
 As the capital city of Jiangsu Province and one of China’s biggest cities, Nanjing is home to more than 6 million residents and is situated in the scenic Yangtze River Delta. Nanjing was known as the center of power for the Ming-Dynasty in the late 14th and early 15th centuries, and from 1927 to 1949 it was distinguished as the capital city of the (then) Republic of China. Today, Nanjing is known as a modern city with ancient roots, where antique relics spanning six dynasties are still visible. Some of its most well-known sights include the Dr. Sun Yat Sen Mausoleum, the Presidential Palace, the Confucius Temple, as well as the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall. Visitors can also follow the Qinhuai River as it winds picturesquely through the city. In addition to numerous activities on its banks, nature-lovers can also enjoy the region’s countless lakes as well a visit to Zijin Shan, otherwise known as the Purple Mountain, which is located to the east of the city.
