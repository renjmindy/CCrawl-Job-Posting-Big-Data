 Critic Career 
 Posted on  December 4, 2018  by  missyhissy 
 I bring you a Critic Career! Loosely inspired by the Sims 4 Critic Career however the only similarities are that the career branches into Food Critic and Art Critic. The levels are completely different. 
 For this career to show up in game, youâ€™ll need  Nraas Careers Mod . 
 You will need  World Adventures  ,  Late Night  and  University  for this career. Various skills from each of these three expansions are used. It was made with patch 1.69. 
The career is in  English  , and supports  German  ,  Russian  ,  Brazilian Portuguese  ,  Dutch  and  French  translations. Iâ€™ll include translation instructions at the end. 
 The career is based at the  Business and Journalism  Office. To change the designated rabbithole to suit your own requirements, I have a tutorial  HERE . 
 It splits into two branches: The Food Critic and Art Critic branches. Each have 5 levels and focuses on the Charisma, Writing and Social Networking skills. The Food Branch also uses the Nectar Making, Cooking and Mixology skills and the Art branch uses the Painting skill. 
There are uniforms for all levels in this career. You can edit career outfits with patch 1.31 and above, so I highly suggest using this feature to give your Sims a uniform of your own choosing 
There are 7 Opportunities for the career. Details for these opportunities can be found  Here . 
Your Sim may receive a bonus on Snowflake Day if Seasons is installed. 
There is no boss for the top levels of the career. For other levels, Bosses can be controlled using  Master Controller . 
There are two custom tones: 
Write Review Notes, which builds the Writing skill 
Post Reviews To Blog, which builds the Social Networking skill. 
 
 Career Levels 
 1.  Critical Blogger  ~ There are some things in the world that just drive you mad. The paintings you saw at the latest art show at the gallery just weren't quite right and there was something extremely off-putting in that meal you dined on last week. Instead of keeping these criticisms to yourself, you're going to put them out to the world on a blog designed for a critic. 
Â§20/hour 
Hours: 12.00pm ~ 5.00pm 
Days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday 
 Food Branch 
 2.  Critical Reporter  ~ Every so often, a catering magazine asks you to report on the experimental dishes the local restaurants produce in order to make recommendations to the readers. It's entirely up to you to take the reins and sample the dishes before making your decisions. Be fair and reasonable but above all, be honest. 
Â§45/hour 
Hours: 9.00am ~ 4.30pm 
Days: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday 
 3.  Radio Reviewer  ~ After great success with your critiques, the local radio station wants you to have the dinner time slot to air your critiques and reach a wider audience. It's a prime slot and could mean greater acclaim and respect for you as a critic and valued reviewer. Once again, keep the reviews honest and fair. 
Â§105/hour 
Hours: 4.00pm ~ 7.00pm 
Days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday 
 4.  Columnist  ~ Having reached an audience as far away as SimCity, the local newspaper is interested in you having a regular Food column to put your critiques and opinions into print for people to refer to. The pay's good and the hours aren't bad. The praise you're receiving for your work is heart warming and so with that in mind, go forth and write regularly! 
Â§185/hour 
Hours: 9.00am ~ 1.30pm 
Days: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday 
 5.  Restaurant Reviewer  ~ Not only has your food reviews hit the spot and reached larger audiences than ever anticipated, but the papers and radio stations want you t start reviewing the restaurants themselves for cleanliness, politeness of staff and general food quality. This job is very important and you can't help but beam as you bear down on a new restaurant with pad and pen in hand. 
Â§235/hour 
Hours: 9.00am ~ 3.30pm 
Days: Monday, Teusday, Friday, Saturday 
 Art Branch 
 2.  Critical Reporter  ~ Each art show that comes into town has a selection of reporters, critics and reviewers in attendance to give opinions and reviews on the latest works of art. Now, you've been invited to share your opinions and reports on the shows with your followers. 
Â§45/hour 
Hours: 9.00pm ~ 2.30pm 
Days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday 
 3.  Art Evaluator  ~ Your opinions have grown to be respected within the Fine Art community and you've been asked to attend a course in Art Evaluation. A very prestigious offer and one you can't turn down. Once you pass, you'll be asked to evaluate certain pieces of art and factor this into your reports and reviews. Good luck! 
Â§125/hour 
Hours: 9.00am ~ 3.00pm 
Days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday 
 4.  Columnist  ~ Having reached an audience as far away as SimCity, the local newspaper is interested in you having a regular Fine Art column to put your critiques and opinions into print for people to refer to. The pay's good and the hours aren't bad. The praise you're receiving for your work is heart warming and so with that in mind, go forth and write regularly! 
Â§185/hour 
Hours: 9.00am ~ 1.30pm 
Days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday 
 5.  Art Appraiser  ~ The artwork you've experienced so far has ranged from the truly incredible to the decidedly awful and as such, you've developed quite an opinion on all things artistic. Now is your time to shine and share those opinions with all and sundry. Enjoy the job, it's yours to keep! 
Â§235/hour 
Hours: 9.00am ~ 2.30pm 
Days: Monday, Wednesday, Friday
