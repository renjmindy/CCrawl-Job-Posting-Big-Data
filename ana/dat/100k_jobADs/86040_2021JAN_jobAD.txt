  How To Boost Your Resume For An Engineering Job  
 Adept Marketing 
 January 14, 2013 
 Looking to beef up your resume for an  engineering job ? Maybe you should explore 3D modeling. 
 
 How 3D Modeling Has Changed Engineering Design Concepts 
 No matter which type of engineering is involved, 3D modeling has changed  engineering services  and design concepts from the static formats of the early days of blueprints to a more realistic form of design using three dimensional modeling. The advantage of engineering professionals who use 3D modeling for their designs is reduction in errors of interpretation of plan drawings by project engineers, fabricators and installers. It's easier to view details in 3D modeling that may be obscured in plan drawings. 
 Advanced 3D Modeling Advantages 
 Today's CAD (computer aided design) offers advanced 3D modeling features that turn an initial drawing into realistic views of final products. 3D modeling is a study advantage engineering students should consider. Hi-tech engineering companies require at least an entry level understanding of 3D modeling. This also includes experience transferring engineering plan drawings, using CAD software, to  3D modeling designs . Having this experience on your resume will give you an extra boost when interviewing for an engineering job. 
 Plot Testing 3D Modeling 
 One example of the best use of 3D modeling occurs in piping and instrumentation design. Instead of relying solely on piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&ID) to fix locations and important structural points, 3D modeling translates P&ID to a visual concept. The visualization of these concepts clearly outlines strategic locations and details of piping and instrumentation crucial to the final installation of systems. The 3D views allow a complete design concept to evolve from basic plan arrangements. 
 Other Uses Of 3D Modeling 
 In addition to 3D Modeling for construction,  structural engineering , piping and instrumentation, this advanced format also aids in design conceptualization for hi-tech industrial and robotic equipment. Today's 3D Modeling quickly interprets design to actual use and mobility factors of equipment. The use of 3D Modeling for engineering creates greater depth in design projects. Eventually engineering plan designs can be projected into virtual reality formats. Thus, designs begin as plan drawings reinterpreted in 3D Modeling and again in virtual reality, in actual phase of operation. In biomedical engineering, a 3D model conceives new methods of medical treatments and procedures. In chemical engineering, a 3D model quickly determines the viability of the balance between chemicals during actual processing. The uses of 3D modeling in the broad spectrum of engineering provides higher efficiency, accuracy and design detail. Some of the largest wastewater treatment systems, skyscrapers and aeronautical equipment are designed and built using 3D modeling. In the agricultural industry, 3D modeling is essential to create agri-templates for maximum productivity. No matter which engineering field you are looking into, staying on top of the latest technologies will ensure you are in the front running for any job you apply for. Constantly look into trainings and extra classes to be proficient in new developing technologies. Photo Credit:  Shutterstock
