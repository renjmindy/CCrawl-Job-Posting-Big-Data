 Peerceptiv, a leader in collaborative learning technologies, is looking for a Pittsburgh-based Front  **** End Developer who wants to have a real impact in the lives of instructors and students. 
 Peerceptiv is moving from a legacy application to a modern web app, and is seeking an experienced React programmer to be the main developer of the front end. Responsibilities will include needs analysis, prototyping & design, coding, QA/QC, and web deployment. 
 The ideal candidate is one who wants real influence in the development of the technology and its strategic direction. Developers aren’t siloed in repetitive activities at Peerceptiv, and have exceptional authority and autonomy over their work. You’ll not only see the direct impact your contributions have in the finished work product, but also be a key player in a fast-growing, early stage company. 
 We anticipate responsibilities growing to match the strengths of the successful candidate, ideally having the position transition over time from a Front End concentration to more of a Full Stack development role. 
 The Peerceptiv team collaborates using tools like Zoom, Slack and Jira, with the work taking place both at Peerceptiv’s office in the East Liberty section of Pittsburgh and remotely. 
 You must be legally authorized to work in the United States without the need for employer sponsorship. 
 Please reply with resume and cover letter to  info@peerceptiv.com , and preferably a link to your Github repository.

 A minimum 2 years experience working with React.js, including Redux, React Hooks and Context API 
 CSS 
 HTML 
 Java 
 General JavaScript and jQuery 
 Experience with responsive design 
 Experience designing for RESTful services 
 
 These skills would be an added benefit: 
 
 Spring 
 AWS 
 Agile/Scrum 
 Jest/other JS unit testing 
 
 
 NOTES: 
 Additional Salary Information: Compensation is competitive and includes stock option equity participation, with excellent health benefits.
