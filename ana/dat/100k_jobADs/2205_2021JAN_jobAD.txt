 That Time When Dr. Seuss was Your English Teacher 
 Posted by  alanasiegel

 Another year, another set of teachers. That's what happens at Vita Post Mortem Academy, a school run by famous dead people. Having special abilities, like being able to see spirits, means extra responsibilities. Jules Winklevoss, the protagonist in my fifth book, The Curse of the Winklevoss Twins, learns that firsthand when she returns for another adventure at the prized academy. 
 Check out the line up of teachers she has for her sophomore year: 
 Science: Marie Curie 
Math: Charles Ponzi 
English: Dr. Seuss 
Social Studies: Princess Diana 
Psychology: Steve Jobs

 What is Kindle Scout? And How do I Vote? 
 Posted by  alanasiegel

 As I request friends and followers to vote for my book on Kindle Scout, I've had lots of people ask me,  what is Kindle Scout? 
 Here's your answer. 
 Kindle Scout  is reader-powered publishing for new, never-before-published books. It's a place where readers help decide if a book gets published. I posted my book on this site before its available for purchase. Based on the short description, first four chapters, and cover, readers can vote for my book to be published by Kindle Press! 
 Here's how to vote. 
 Once you are on the page:  https://kindlescout.amazon.com/p/24VKXYPLERGLP 
 Select the  nominate  option. It will direct you to log into your Amazon account to complete the nomination. That's it! You will have voted for my book!
