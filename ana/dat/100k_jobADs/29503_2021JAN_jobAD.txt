 Now Hiring The Latest Job Openings and Hiring in Ford 5500, Intel 4000, Daimler 10000, Microsoft 8400, UnitedHealth Group 790, Lowe's 50,000 and Home Depot 60,000 
 With the job market being as tight as it is, we thought we'd track down the latest information for the businesses, organizations, and industries now hiring. 
 As tough as it is these days searching for a job, news keeps coming in of companies with hundreds if not thousands of openings. And while a thousand new jobs, might not be enough to put the millions of unemployed Americans back on the job, it is a step in the right direction. 
 Where possible we've tried to pinpoint what areas of the country will be most affected by these hirings, so that you can determine which opportunities are most relevant to your current job search.

 Ford Focus Suppliers Add 5,500 New Jobs 
 One of the important things to remember about the recovery of the American auto industry is that when one model is a hit, it's not just good news for the specific manufacturer that puts it out -- it means more profits and more jobs for all the companies that provide parts. 
 Such is the case with   Ford 's new Focus, a global car which is expected to  add at least 5,500 new jobs  to the economy. Companies such as Robert Bosch LLC will be making parts for the new Focus.

 Intel Taking on 4,000 
 A new $5 billion-plus manufacturing plant in Chandler, Ariz., along with increased demand, are sending semiconductor giant Intel on a   hiring spree  of more than 4,000 workers that should last all the way through 2011. 
 With more than 15,000 workers in Oregon, Intel is already that state's largest private employer. While many of the new Intel   jobs will be in Arizona , a number will be located in Oregon, as well as in New Mexico, where Intel also has a major presence.

 10,000 Auto Jobs Open at Daimler 
 The good news is that one auto manufacturer is doing so well it's looking to hire 10,000 new employees in the next year. The not-so-good news is that you might need to speak German if you'd like to apply for some of the positions.

 Microsoft Adding Thousands 
 It's a great time for techies. First Google announces they're hiring 6,000, and now Microsoft says they want to add an additional 2,400 software engineer and research positions by the end of the year, according to a recent   post  on FINS.com. Those jobs will be located all over the world, and will be filled as soon as they can find suitable candidates.

 UnitedHealth Group Has Hundreds of Openings 
 Everyone knows that that health care industry is one of the few areas that has been consistently hiring despite the ups and downs facing the rest of the economy. But many people forget that you don't have to be a doctor, nurse, or a licensed health care technician to work in the industry. 
 UnitedHealth Group, for example has openings for jobs in information technology, accounting, marketing.

 Lowe's To Take On Over 50,000 
 Not to be outdone by   Home Depot , which announced yesterday it will hire more than 60,000 seasonal workers, Lowe's, the smaller  home improvement  store chain, is hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for its retail stores. That's up from the 43,000 temporary workers they brought in last year, and represents a 16 percent increase, according to various  newspaper reports . 
 Home Depot to Employ 60,000 
 The new jobs may be seasonal, part time and temporary, but the 60,000 jobs   Home Depot  is offering right now total more than all new jobs created in the entire nation last month ( 36,000 ). Savvy and engaged employees will be able to convert those  part time jobs  into full time work -- with benefits.
