 Musings from a Job-Starved City: the Fiscal Cliff 
 Posted on  December 29, 2012  by  pezcita 
 
 Congress seems like the worst body to decide how to keep us from falling off the fiscal cliff, if only because none of its members have ever been at the bottom. Like many post-crash college grads, I've had a terrible time finding full-time work in my job-starved city. It finally dawned on me today why so many "entry-level" jobs are only part time. The government must secretly encourage this practice, so they can enroll more and more people in the military or Americorp. Once they've got most of us young folks under contract, they'll go for older people, then older still, all the way up the population. Or should I say all the way to Communism? You really have to wonder anymore, if you dare.
