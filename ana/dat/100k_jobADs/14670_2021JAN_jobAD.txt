 The mine is located in the Callide Basin of Central Queensland and is adjacent to the rural city of Biloela. 
 Capcoal 
 Capcoal operates two underground mines and two open cut mines which together mine approximately 12 Mtpa of coal to produce in excess of 9 Mtpa of high-quality hard coking coal, pulverised coal injection (PCI) and thermal coal. 
 Capcoal is located in the heart of the Bowen Basin in Central Queensland. 
 Dartbrook 
 Dartbrook is an underground coal mine in Upper Hunter Valley, New South Wales, which was placed under care and maintenance in 2007. The long-term future of the mine is under review by the joint venture partners with a range of options being considered. 
 Dawson 
 Dawson is one of Queensland's leading export coal operations. An open cut mining operation, Dawson spans almost 60 kilometres and uses three draglines and a significant truck fleet to produce approximately 7.5 Mtpa of coal. 
 Dawson is located in the Dawson Valley, at the southern end of the Bowen Basin in Central Qld.
