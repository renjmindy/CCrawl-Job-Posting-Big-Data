 The Job complex 
 Standard 
 Job 3:25 "For the thing I greatly feared has come upon me, And what I dreaded has happened to me." 
 Even though Job was the 'wealthiest' man in the East, he had fear within that his good fortune wouldn't last! He made offerings (of fear & superstition) every day 'in case' his children had sinned - so he was also very religiousâ€¦ 
 But - His expectation was that he was going to lose it all. We need to go after our sub-concious fears or they will go after us! We can re-program our thinking by speaking the Word to ourselves. 
 The words 'fear not' are found at least 365 times in Scripture. Expectation is powerful. Make sure it's for the right things! 
 See you in Church!

 Fear is one large obstacle we allow to have power over us. We allow it to control our thoughts and actions. If we overcome fear by 'fearing not' and trusting in God, there is so much more we can accomplish in the natural.
