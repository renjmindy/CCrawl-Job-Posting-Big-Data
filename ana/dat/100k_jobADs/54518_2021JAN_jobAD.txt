 The city of Hong Kong has announced a lockdown that will begin at midnight local time as a result of 61 new coronavirus cases. The lockdown will include about 150 residential buildings in the Yau Tsim Mong district and will be enforced by almost 2,000 “disciplined services officers”. The 7.5 million people living in these residential buildings will be restricted from leaving the area until the lockdown is lifted. There have been scattered reports that China has been enforcing localized lockdowns in several areas with outbreaks, as it tries to protect the city of Beijing. China has pointed to the imports of frozen foods as the reason the that the virus was brought into the country. 
 Following Inauguration Day, President Joe Biden is moving forward with a series of executive orders. Joe Biden signed an executive order on Thursday instructing U.S government agencies to use the Defense Production Act to increase supplies of COVID tests, N95 masks, and vaccine syringes, citing the lack of critical supplies to fight the pandemic. The Biden administration is planning for an order that would require people to wear masks in airports and on planes which is similar to the order that was signed on Wednesday requiring people to wear masks on all federal properties. President Biden is also pushing for schools to open in the first 100 days of his presidency.

 U.S. and World News 
 
 On Thursday evening, President-elect Joe Biden revealed his proposal for a $1.9 trillion fiscal relief package. The proposed spending includes $1,400 stimulus payments to all Americans, an extension of expanded unemployment benefits through September of 2021 that would include an additional $400 a week, $370 billion of aid to state and local governments, and $190 billion for public health funding. Additionally, an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15/hour has been included in the bill which has been strictly opposed by Senate Republicans. Due to the overwhelming size of the relief bill and the inclusion of a minimum wage hike, it is expected that the fiscal relief bill will face opposition in the Senate, where 10 Republican votes will be required. 
 The U.S. House of Representatives voted to impeach President Donald Trump for the second time this year following the event that took place at the Capitol on January 6th. The article of impeachment accuses President Trump of “willfully inciting violence against the government of the United States”, referring to his tweets in the days following up to January 6th and his rally that he held in Washington on that day. President Trump was subsequently removed and/or suspended from most all popular social media platforms. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced today that she plans to send the impeachment to the Senate sometime next week, as President-elect Joe Biden is scheduled to be officially sworn into office on Wednesday, January 20th.

 The year 2020 ended with the United States remaining far behind its goal of 20 million vaccinations, sitting at just 6.25 million vaccinated. There has been criticism of the Trump administrations strategy of withholding 50% of the available supply, so that they can then distribute the second wave of doses for the second round of vaccinations that is needed for immunity. Further, the FDA has backed this up by stating that there is no evidence that immunity can develop with just a single dose, and that both are needed. President Elect Joe Biden stated his intention to accelerate the distribution of the vaccine, releasing every available dose when he takes office. While this strategy will certainly speed up the process of distribution, it will not solve the issue that hospitals currently have with government regulations recently put in place. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City May Bill de Blasio have had their trouble as they argue the effectiveness of Cuomo’s penalties for New York hospitals missing vaccination targets. 
 As a result of the Georgia run-off election, Democrats are now set to control the senate in the coming weeks with Vice President Elect Kamala Harris being the tie-breaker. The Democratic sweep has led to expectations of potential trillions in new stimulus, until this afternoon when Democratic Senator Joe Manchin III poured cold water on that potential after he said that he would “absolutely not” support a new round of stimulus checks. With the new composition of the Senate, Joe Biden and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer cannot afford to lose one Democratic vote to pass legislation. Shortly after the Senator’s statement, he issued a follow-up statement that he would evaluate Joe Biden’s aid plan when the time comes, adding further confusion to expectations.

 The Federal Drug Administration advisory panel has confirmed on Thursday that the benefits of approving Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine outweigh the risks, putting the ball in the FDA’s court for approval, which could come as soon as tomorrow. According to Bloomberg, as of this morning, over 1.1 million people across four countries have been vaccinated. In the United States, the vaccine has been given to health care workers, as public workers on the front lines are first in line. Pfizer has publically expressed its happiness throughout the week with the success of the vaccine rollout, though there have been some scattered reports of supply chain issues. Given the approval from the FDA, Moderna’s vaccine distribution is expected to run smoother, as the vaccine does not require special storage equipment to keep it at extreme cold temperatures. 
 Stimulus negotiations in Washington have made significant progress throughout the week, with both sides having a lot invested, it is anticipated that a deal will be done, however it seems that talks will run into the weekend as differences still remain. The size of the stimulus package, as it stands now, is just under $1 trillion and does not include the major sticking points of state and local aid and liability protections for businesses. It is being reported that the stimulus package will include $600 stimulus checks to individuals and unemployment benefits of $300 a week. The latest complication is a Republican Senator’s demand to terminate the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending program by the end of the year, when it was originally set to expire in the CARES Act.

 Brexit negotiations have made no progress while the December 31st deadline is only weeks away, increasing expectations that the United Kingdom will leave the European Union without a deal potentially resulting in major supply chain disruptions throughout Europe. The “no deal” scenario would include the U.K. leaving the European Union without a comprehensive trade deal covering the $1 trillion in annual bilateral trade. Among the issues of disagreement involve the U.K. seeking independence regarding climate, specifically fishing rights, as well as labor standards. The European Union, however, does not want to give up a certain level of judicial oversight of the U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and President of the European Commission Ursula Von Der Leyen both warned that the probability of a “no deal” is high and have pointed to Sunday as a deadline for negotiators. 
 The Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA COVID vaccine was approved by a Food and Drug Administration Advisory panel for emergency use on Thursday, paving the way for vaccinations in the United States to begin. The committee voted on whether the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks for use in individuals 16 years of age and older, and it passed 17-4, while one voter abstained. Once the vaccine is ultimately approved by the FDA, the first batches will likely be given to healthcare workers, while certain categories of Americans next in line is being debated.

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit and closed above 30,000 on Tuesday for the first time since its inception in 1896. Vaccine sentiment reignited the recovery rally on hope that the economy will soon get back to normal, and was topped off by the GSA clearing the way for a presidential transition process and reports that Janet Yellen could head up the Treasury. 
 The biggest shopping weekend of the year is here, with bargain hunters across the U.S. planning to spend the next few days searching for discounts in stores and online despite the coronavirus pandemic. With rising wages and increasing consumer confidence, U.S. holiday sales are expected to grow between 3.6% and 5.2%, compared with the 4% growth last year, while online sales are seen rising 20% to 30%, according to the National Retail Federation.

 U.S. and World News 
 
 The United States reported a record 180,000 new cases of coronavirus yesterday, prompting the CDC to urge Americans to stay home for the Thanksgiving holiday. Also, the level of hospitalizations has doubled in the past two weeks, causing the level of deaths to increase as well. Several individual states throughout the week have put in place additional restrictions that include curfews for non-essential businesses, a ban on gatherings with people outside of your household, and capacity limits for retailers. Additional positive vaccine data rolled in this week from Moderna and Astrazeneca as Pfizer submits its application to the FDA for their emergency-use designation. Dr. Anthony Fauci has expressed concern about skepticism as it relates to vaccines, he told reporters this week that “if we have an effective vaccine and 50% of the population refuses to take it, you still have a considerable public-health challenge”. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla stated that the first doses of the vaccine could be distributed within hours of approval. 
 On Thursday evening, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin requested that the Federal Reserve let five of the nine credit facilities put in place as part of the CARES act expire on December 31st. Secretary Mnuchin stated that the facilities have “clearly achieved their objective” and bond issuance volumes have returned to their pre-COVID-19 levels. The Federal Reserve issued a statement reading “The Federal Reserve would prefer that the full suite of emergency facilities established during the coronavirus pandemic continue to serve their important role as a backstop for our still-strained and vulnerable economy.” Mr. Mnuchin also argued that the funds need to be reallocated to the people that need it, and not to buy bonds, referring to the approximately $455 billion remaining from the CARES Act.

 Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. and its German biotech partner BioNTech released data Monday morning showing that its vaccine is 90% effective. The effectiveness rate of the Pfizer vaccine is far higher than the 44% effectiveness rate of the flu vaccine and is comparable to the rates seen for Mumps and Chickenpox. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told reporters that the trial will be finished by the end of November and is expected to gain emergency-use approval by the end of this year. Dr. Scott Gottlieb stated that the timeline for mass vaccination is late February/early March and that it may not be broadly available until the end of the second quarter/beginning of the third quarter of next year. The distribution of the vaccine is expected to be complex and expensive, as it has a short shelf life and must be stored at -94 degrees Fahrenheit. Dr. Anthony Fauci told reporters that biotech company Moderna’s vaccine might exhibit similar results to Pfizer’s. 
 New daily coronavirus cases in the United States are surging as 150,530 new cases were reported yesterday and the 7-day average in new cases reached 130,000 which is about 100,000 higher than where it was in September.

Yesterday, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced a stay-at-home advisory for the city after seeing a record spike in new infections and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker announced that the state is on the verge of new shutdowns as well.

 U.S. and World News 
 
 The roller coaster ride that is the 2020 presidential election continues today, as absentee ballots in battleground states Nevada, Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Alaska, and Arizona are still being counted. Contrary to what the polls suggested, the results on Tuesday night indicated that President Trump was likely to win the election, however as absentee ballots were counted throughout the week, Joe Biden took the lead in several key states. As it stands today, there is a large indication that Joe Biden will win the election, and he is expected to address the nation tonight. This is not without threatened litigation by President Trump, who claims that the election is being stolen due to orchestrated Democrat voter fraud in key battleground states. Also contrary to polling, Republicans have picked up six House of Representatives seats and have lost one Senate seat, pending further results. More clarity on results is expected going into the weekend, but anticipated litigation by the President could lead to some more uncertainty in the longer run. 
 The fate of the next fiscal stimulus bill is being questioned after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has stated that the upbeat jobs report this morning and the 6.9% unemployment rate “clearly ought to affect the size of any additional stimulus package we do”. Prior to the surprise jobs number and lower-than-expected unemployment figure, Senate Republicans had proposed a $500 billion relief bill, compared to the administrations $1.9 trillion proposal last month. Larry Kudlow also helped pour cold water on the hopes of a large stimulus package after he stated that “we’re not interested in you know two or three trillion” citing the jobs report this morning.
