 Worst-Ever Haircut 
 Nov 19, 2010 
 Sheeesh. Who takes pictures of their worst hair cuts? 
 I have a bad habit of snipping away at my hair myself when it annoys me. Then several scissor-happy sessions later when I see an actual hairdresser and she tells me my cut is all uneven I just say oh, I know, that idiot who did my last trim was SO stupid….. 
 Surprisingly enough, I'm rather good at cutting other people's hair. You know, as long as they're not going anywhere special for at least two weeks. 
 All you have to do to get good at it is to practice a lot; on dolls, younger siblings and your own children. Then when your spouse asks you to give him a haircut you will know that you've either become extremely talented or he just doesn't give a damn what he looks like anymore. 
 As long as he doesn't end up resembling Donald Trump, I figure I've done a pretty good job.
