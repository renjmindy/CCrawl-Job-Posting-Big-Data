 Upgrade your Membership 
 Benefits of Upgrading 
 Below are some of the benefits of upgrading your membership. 
 Increase Job Quote Limit 
 The maximum amount that you can quote on a job will depend on the membership type that you choose. For Job Seekers looking to only quote on smaller jobs, the Bronze membership is not only free, but comes with many great WorkLocally features that could be perfect for all your needs. 
 For Job Seekers looking to quote on larger jobs, you may be more suited to a Silver or Gold membership. Remember, you can easily upgrade or downgrade your membership at any time, should you feel that a different membership type would suit your needs better. 
 Access Callback Jobs 
 Callback jobs are jobs submitted by a Job Poster looking for up to 7 interested Job Seekers to contact them directly to arrange a quote. 
 Whilst all membership types allow users to post a Callback job, only Silver and Gold members can register their interest in these Job Posts. 
 For those looking to access Callback Job leads then a Silver or Gold membership would be perfect for you. 
 Please note, you must be a verified WorkLocally member before you can quote on Callback Jobs. 
 If you are a commercial Job Seeker, you must be Company & VAT verified before you can quote on Callback Jobs. 
 If you are an independent Job Seeker, you must be Identity and Address verified before you can quote on Callback Jobs. 
 Get Email Alerts 
 One of the great benefits of upgrading to a Silver or Gold membership is that you will be able to set up email alerts tailored to your skills and area. 
 Once set up, you will automatically receive alerts on any new jobs posted in your area that match your skills, putting you in the best position to quote on and win jobs in your area. 
 View Jobs on Map 
 Upgrading to a Silver or Gold membership will allow you to view jobs that you have registered an interest in, quoted on, or jobs that have been awarded by the Job Poster, all on a geographical based map. 
 The map format allows you to quickly see where jobs are located and to plan your work schedules accordingly.

 Attract More Job Seekers 
 Attracting More Job Seekers 
 Below are some of the ways a Managed Post could help you attract more Job Seekers. 
 Receiving Quotes 
 Your time may be limited, or you may only want to receive quotes from a small number of Job Seekers. If thats the case then the Callback allows you to specify the number of Job Seekers up to 7, that you want to contact you. 
 The Managed Post allows unlimited Job Seekers to provide you with a quote, but you can award your job to any one of them at any time - as and when you find the right person for you! 
 Comparing Quotes 
 If you submit your Job Post under the Managed Post you will receive unlimited quotes from interested Job Seekers. Once received you will be able to see all your quotes in one place and cross compare them. 
 Exchanging Contact Details 
 With Managed Post, contact details will ONLY be exchanged with the Job Seeker when you have awarded them the Job, and most importantly, when the Job Seeker has accepted to undertake the job NOT before! 
 If after initial contact you dont want to proceed with that Job Seeker for a variety of reasons, you can always withdraw the award and award your job to another Job Seeker. 
 Okay 
 close 
 Improving Quote Accuracy 
 Receiving More Accurate Quotes 
 Below is some advice as to how you could improve the accuracy of the quotes you receive. 
 Summarise and Describe your Job Post 
 Summarising your Job Post will enable Job Seekers to see whether they have the skills and appetite required to complete your job. This reduces any wasted time and effort by ensuring that only the right Job Seekers provide you with a quote. 
 Both Managed and Callbacks enable you to provide a detailed description of the type and scope of your job. 
 Provide Measurements 
 In order to receive the most accurate quote it is important to include any relevant measurements, dimensions, sizes or quantities which could affect the quotation. 
 Both the Quick and Managed Post Job Posts have a specific field for you to provide these details. 
 Upload Pictures 
 In order to enhance your description and obtain the most accurate quote, both the Managed and Callback options allow you to upload up to 4 images. 
 Okay 
 close 
 Selecting Job Seekers 
 Selecting the Right Job Seeker 
 There are many factors that should be taken into consideration when selecting who to award your job to. Below are some of the features and functions available that will help you make the right decision for you. 
 WorkLocally Verification 
 For additional peace of mind, WorkLocally offers a verification service to verify Job Seekers address, identity, Company status, VAT Status and Public Liability Insurance. 
 During the verification process WorkLocally will also obtain and verify two references for the Job Seeker. 
 Once verified, a marker will be placed on their public profile for you to review and compare. 
 Ensuring verification will give you additional peace of mind. 
 Skills, Qualifications and TrustMark Registrations 
 The Job Seekers Public Profile contains details of the type of skills they describe themselves as having as well as any skills that they have registered with TrustMark. TrustMark is an independent scheme operated to promote and improve standards in the repair, maintenance and improvement sectors. Being TrustMark registered means that the tradesman has been assessed as reputable and trustworthy by the scheme operators. 
 The Job Seekers Public Profile will also provide details of any qualifications or certifications that they hold, and, possessing such qualifications may be instrumental in your decision making process. However, as WorkLocally does not verify any certifications / qualifications, please ensure that you check the Jobs Seekers certifications and qualifications where appropriate. 
 Feedback 
 When a Job has been undertaken by a Job Seeker, both the Job Seeker and Job Poster have the opportunity to leave Feedback about the job. Job Seekers and Job Posters can leave Positive, Neutral or Negative Feedback which, over time, is used to build the Public Profile of the WorkLocally member. 
 Although a more in-depth view of all Feedback left is available for review, the Positive Feedback Percentage, based on a Feedback score calculation, provides an overview of the feedback that the WorkLocally member has received over a 12 month period. 
 Leaving feedback helps to foster a culture of accountability and helps other Job Posters to make informed decisions on whom to award their job to.

 For additional peace of mind, WorkLocally offers a verification service to verify Job Seekers address, identity, Company status, VAT Status and Public Liability Insurance. 
 Once verified, a marker will be placed on their public profile for you to review and compare. 
 Ensuring verification will give you additional peace of mind. However, please also review their previous Feedback and judge for yourselves if a Job Seeker is the right fit for your job. 
 close 
 Leave Feedback 
 Once your job has been completed by the Job Seeker, whether you submitted a Managed or Callback, you can return to WorkLocally to leave feedback. 
 The feedback you leave about the Job Seeker and the work they completed can be viewed by others. 
 Leaving feedback helps to foster a culture of accountability and helps other Job Posters to make informed decisions on whom to award their job to. 
 close 
 No More Chasing Job Seekers 
 Regardless of whether you post a Managed or Callback Job Post, you will no longer have to chase tradesman. 
 Interested Job Seekers will come directly to you, taking out the stress and hassle of trawling through directories to find someone who is willing and interested in providing you with a quote. 
 close 
 Making Informed Decisions 
 No matter how you post your job, you will be able to review the public profile, skills and previous feedback of all our registered Job Seekers. This will help you to make informed decisions on whom to award your job to. 
 close 
 Share Your Experience 
 Sharing your experiences through the feedback mechanism helps to foster a culture of accountability as well as helping others make informed decisions. 
 You can also share your experiences of using WorkLocally and read the experiences of others on our dedicated public forum.

 Feedback Calculation 
 Calculation 
 When a Job has been undertaken by a Job Seeker, both the Job Seeker and Job Poster have the opportunity to leave Feedback about the job. Job Seekers and Job Posters can leave Positive, Neutral or Negative Feedback which, over time, is used to build the Public Profile of the user. 
 Although a more in-depth view of all Feedback left is available for review, the Positive Feedback Percentage, based on a Feedback score calculation, provides an overview of the feedback that the user has received over a 12 month period. 
 In order to calculate Positive Feedback, WorkLocally uses the following Feedback Score Calculation: 
 Positive   Positive + Negative 
 Please note: 
 Neutral Feedback is not included as part of the Positive Feedback calculation. 
 Example 
 The WorkLocally member's 12 month Feedback rating is calculated as follows: 
 Positive: 110   Negative: 3 
 This member's Positive Feedback percentage is calculated as follows: 
 | 
 110   110 + 3 
 
 
 
 x100 
 = 97.3%

 Job Email Alerts 
 Email Notification Alerts 
 By enabling the job email alert you will receive alerts based on your 'pre-saved search' configuration - on a daily basis. 
 N.B.: 
Only 1 email alert notification will be sent by WorkLocally per advertised job. WorkLocally will not send you a repeat email notification alert for the same job. 
 WorkLocally Recommendation: 
The WorkLocally team encourages you to keep the pre-saved searches simple in order to receive email alerts that match your search criteria. The more complex the alert, the less chance you have of receiving an email notification alert. 
 Thank you, 
 The WorkLocally team.

 For the avoidance of doubt, we do not act as an employment business or employment agency (as defined by the Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 2003) in relation to the introduction and supply of Jobs and Job Seekers pursuant to this Agreement. 
 These terms and conditions (the "  Terms  ") (together with our, Privacy Policy and Terms of Website Use) tell you information about us and the legal terms and conditions on which we provide the Site to you. 
 1. THESE TERMS 
 1.1  What these terms cover:  These are the Terms that govern your Job Seeker status with us and the basis on which we provide the Site to you. 
 1.2  Why you should read them:  Please read these Terms carefully before you submit your Job Seeker Form to us. These Terms tell you who we are, how we will provide the Site to you, how you and we may change or end your Job Seeker status, what to do if there is a problem and other important information.

 2. BECOMING A JOB SEEKER 
 2.1  How to become a Job Seeker:  By completing and submitting the Job Seeker Form and paying the Job Seeker Fee, as set out in clause 4 below, and our acceptance of the same by us, you will become a Job Seeker and gain access to our Site as a Job Seeker and have the ability to make an offer to Job Posters to undertake Jobs for them which they may accept. 
 2.2  Job Seeker term:  Your status as a Job Seeker commences on the date we accept your Job Seeker Form, and unless terminated earlier in accordance with these Terms, will continue if a non-paid member acknowledging restricted functionality, or until the renewal period if a paid Bronze, Silver or Gold member; one year from receiving successful payment. 
 2.3  Job Seeker authorisation:  By becoming a Job Seeker and providing us with your payment details, you hereby authorise us to debit the Job Seeker Fee from your bank account in accordance with the provisions of these Terms. 
 2.4  If we cannot accept your Job Seeker Form:  If we are unable to accept your Job Seeker Form, or your continued status as a Job Seeker, we will inform you of this. This might be because of incomplete information, unexpected limits on our resources or other commercial factors. 
 2.5  Your Job Seeker number:  We will assign a Job Seeker number to you and tell you what it is when we accept your Job Seeker Form. It will help us if you can tell us your Job Seeker number whenever you contact us. 
 2.6  Geographical Restrictions:  Our Site is for use in the UK, Ireland Channel Islands and Isle of Man only. 
 3. WAYS TO FIND WORK 
 3.1  Online Quotes Job Posts: 
 Step one:  once you have been notified of the acceptance of your Job Seeker Form and you become a Job Seeker, we will provide you with log in details to enable you to log on to our Site and review Job posts ("  Job Posts  ") that detail specific work required by Job Posters; 
 Step two:  in accordance with your membership tier (as set out in clause 4), you can quote ("  Job Quote  ") for your work in completing the Job detailed in a Job Post ("  Job Offer  "). The Job Poster will then review your Job Offer together with other Job Seekers' Job Offers before accepting one of such Job Offers; 
 Step three:  upon your Job Offer being accepted by a Job Poster, a contract will arise between you and the Job Poster and you and the Job Poster will gain access to each other's contact details and other relevant information about each other and the Job; 
 Step four:  once the Job is complete, the Job Poster will confirm completion and the Job Quote will be paid by the Job Poster directly to you. 
 3.2  Direct Callback Job Posts: 
 Step one:  to use the Direct Callback job post feature, a Job Seeker must purchase pre-paid tokens ("  Callback Tokens  "), but before doing so, they must be verified. To be verified, the Job Seeker must, (i) if a sole trader, provide a copy of their passport or driving licence and a recent utility bill, or (ii) if an independent person (neither a Sole Trader or a Company), provide a copy of their passport or driving licence and a recent utility bill, or (iii) if a company, provide a VAT number and their full company name and company number. 
 Step two:  once verified, a Job Seeker must purchase Callback Tokens. 
 Step three:  Job Posters can elect to post Jobs on our Site's Direct Callback job post feature ("  Direct Callback Job Posts  "). A Job Seeker can search the submitted Direct Callback Job Posts, and use their Callback Tokens to obtain the contact details of the Job Poster whose Direct Callback Job Post they want to work on. The Job Poster can then make direct contact with the Job Seeker, however work resulting from Direct Callback Job Posts is not guaranteed. 
 3.3  How long do Callback Tokens last:  Callback Tokens last for six months from the date that they are purchased. If they are not used within that time, they will be lost without any refund or other compensation given to the Job Seeker. 
 3.4  Multiple Job Seekers:  Once a Job Seeker has used a Callback Token to access the contact details of a Job Poster, other Job Seekers can still use their Callback Tokens to access the same contact details of the same Job Poster in relation to the same Direct Callback Job Post. 
 3.5  We are not responsible for delays:  If the supply of the Site's features is delayed we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. We will not be liable for delays caused for any reason. 
 3.6  No redirection:  You must not include hyperlinks to any website, including your website, in any Job Offer. 
 4. JOB SEEKER MEMBERSHIP TIER 
 4.1  Job Seeker Membership:  By paying a yearly charge to us ("  Membership Fee  "), you will have the ability to offer your services by making Job Offers in response to Job Posts, in accordance with clause 3 above. 
 4.2  The Tiers:  There are three tiers of Job Seeker Membership, each of which carries a different yearly fee, as detailed in the table below 
 | 
 4.3 The Job Seeker Form allows you to select a Membership Tier. By default, Job Seekers will automatically become a Member Job Seeker at zero cost when registering to WorkLocally with reduced functionality to explore the WorkLocally site, unless a membership tier is selected from the above table. 
 4.4 We may, from time to time, and at our absolute discretion, offer Bronze Membership free of charge or any other discount for a period of time as decided by us. 
 4.5  Verification.  To become a Silver or Gold Job Seeker you must, if a sole trader, provide a copy of your passport or driving licence and a recent utility bill, or, if a company, provide a VAT number and your company's name and number. If this information is not provided, becomes out of date, or is found to be false (including if it is out of date), we may remove your verification status or in extreme cases we may terminate your Membership. We may periodically ask for more recent versions of the information and documents, at our discretion, including references - you must obtain the prior approval of a referee before providing the referee's contact details. 
 4.6 The Membership Fee (Bronze, Silver, Gold) is payable yearly in advance, and will be due one year from the date that you become a Job Seeker ("  Payment Date  "). For the avoidance of doubt, if a Job Seeker pays their first Membership Fee on the 16 April 2018, the date that the subsequent Membership Fee will become due is the 16 April 2019. Further, if the first Membership Fee is paid on 29, 30 or 31 day of a month, any subsequent month that does not have a 29, 30 or 31 day will cause the Membership Fee to be payable on the last day of that month. 
 4.7 Moving from a Gold Membership to a Silver or Bronze Membership, or from a Silver Membership to a Bronze Membership will be a downgrade ("  Downgrade  "). Moving from a Bronze Membership to a Silver or Gold Membership, or from a Silver Membership to a Gold Membership will be an upgrade ("  Upgrade  "). 
 4.8 You can change your Membership Tier at any time. To do so simply select the Upgrade or Downgrade button from your membership page. Please be aware that you are only able to change the tier of your membership once in any 24 hour period. 
 4.9 If you Downgrade your Membership, the Payment Date will stay the same. If you Upgrade your Membership, the Payment Date will change to be on the same day as the date that the Membership Tier is Upgraded. 
 4.10  Payment.  We take payment from your payment card or PayPal account at the time we receive your order, once we have checked your payment card or PayPal details. 
 4.10.1 In the event that we are unable to supply the services, we will inform you of this as soon as possible. 
 4.10.2 Additional Terms and Conditions for payments made by PayPal can be found at www.paypal.co.uk. 
 4.10.3 By providing payment details, you confirm that you are the owner of the payment method (e.g. the debit or credit card) or you have been authorised to use the payment method. 
 4.10.4 To ensure that your credit, debit, charge card or PayPal account is not being used without your consent, we may validate your name, address and other personal information supplied by you during the order process against appropriate third party databases. 
 4.10.5 By accepting these terms and conditions you consent to such checks being made. In performing these checks personal information provided by you may be disclosed to a registered Credit Reference Agency which may keep a record of that information. You can rest assured that this is done only to confirm your identity, that a credit check is not performed and that your credit rating will be unaffected. All information provided by you will be treated securely and strictly in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. 
 4.11  Cancelling a direct debit subscription payment.  Cancelling a direct debit subscription payment is an easy process. If you would like to cancel your subscription, do not renew the yearly subscription payment when requested. If successfully cancelled, you will receive an email from us stating so. To check the status, log into your account, click on the following from the Dashboard Landing Page: Payment. In the Current Bill tab under Purchase Summary in the Next Payment table will show the renewal date and payment amount to continue our service to you. 
 4.12 Subject to your payment of the Membership Fee set out in the table above you are granted the right to access our Site as a Job Seeker subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 
 4.13 All billing reminders will be sent by email to the registered email address you provide.

 5.1 The three Membership Tiers grant Job Seekers different rights and accesses to the Site. These may vary from time to time. 
 5.2 Each Membership Tier has a maximum limit on the amount that can be quoted for a Job by a Job Seeker. The limitations are set in the table below. 
 
 6. YOUR OBLIGATIONS 
 6.1 You should not make a Job Offer unless you are sure that you can attend and fulfil the requirements of the Job as stated in the Job Post; this includes considering the location, start time, estimated time of the Job, and any other material information that is supplied in the Job Post. By making a Job Offer, you warrant and undertake that the Job Offer will be completed in time and to a satisfactory standard. 
 6.2 If you make a Job Offer, which is accepted by a Job Poster you will: 
 6.2.1 attend and complete the Job to the best of your ability, taking all reasonable care while carrying out the Job. 
 6.2.2 co-operate with the Job Poster's reasonable instructions and accept the direction, supervision and control of the Job Poster;

 6.3 If a Job requires equipment to complete it, you must supply that equipment at your own cost so that the Job can be completed to the requisite standard. 
 6.4 If you are unable for any reason (including illness) to attend a Job that you have accepted, or if you are expecting to arrive later than agreed, you should inform the Job Poster immediately so that alternative arrangements can be made by the Job Poster. The Job Poster will not have to pay you the Job Quote if you cannot attend the Job as a result of illness or for any other reason. 
 6.5 You should not attend a Job if you are ill, especially if the illness is contagious. If you are in any doubt, you will contact the Job Poster to inform them of the illness you have. The Job Poster will then make a decision as to whether they will allow you to attend the Job. 
 6.6 If, either before or during the course of a Job, you become aware of any reason why you may not be suitable for a Job, you will notify the Job Poster without delay. 
 6.7 If in the course of a Job you ever feel in danger or unsafe, for whatever reason, or if you consider that a person or animal is in danger, then you must call the police on 999 as soon as possible. Safety of all parties involved in a Job is of paramount importance. 
 7. REDUCING AND INCREASING A JOB QUOTE 
 7.1  Reducing a Job Quote:  If the Job you provided a Job Quote for takes less time than expected and you wish to reduce the cost of the Job, you may do so. 
 7.2  Increasing a Job Quote:  If the Job you provided a Job Quote for takes more time than expected and you wish to increase the cost of the Job, you may do so as long as you agree a price with the Job Poster before charging more, and the price does not increase above the limit of your Membership Tier.

 8.1.3 for any other reason in our absolute discretion. 
 8.2  More significant changes to your Job Seeker Membership and these Terms:  We may increase the Membership Fee, but if we do so we will notify you beforehand and you may then contact us to end your Job Seeker status before the changes take effect.

 10.1.3 for any other reason that we in our absolute discretion consider appropriate. 
 10.2 All parts of these Terms, which by their very nature should survive the expiration or termination of your Membership, shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding and subsequent to the expiration or termination of your Membership.

 19.6  Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later:  If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of you breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.

 How it Works 
 Securing your information 
 How it works? 
An SSL creates a secure tunnel through which information including personal identifiable documentation, driving licence details, passport or company based papers can pass safely. 
 First, the SSL "handshake" 
When a Job Seeker enters an SSL-protected area of WorkLocally, the SSL certificate automatically creates an encrypted connection with the Job Seekers browser. 
 The padlock icon appears 
Once the connection is complete, a padlock icon and HTTPS prefix will appear in the Job Seekers browser bar to show them they're safe to share personal or confidential details. The high-assurance "Extended Validation" Certificate browser status bar will also turn a green colour. 
 You're good to go! 
All information passing to and from WorkLocally is now scrambled by the 2048-bit encryption that's virtually unbreakable by hackers.

 Post a Job 
 Classify your Job Post 
 
 Give your job post a title that will appear as a summary for the job listing page. Keep it short and high level in order for a Job Seeker to understand what you are looking for. 
 By using WorkLocally's intuitive classification schema, narrow down the job post to the closest match to make it easier for the Job Seeker to search for your job. 
 Define the job scope by selecting the appropriate drop- down option - supply, install, fix only, including defining the type of job post; installation, maintenance or perhaps just a replacement. Providing the high level detail is invaluable for Job Seekers to understand the dynamics of the job. 
 
 Describe your Job Post 
 
 In a short descriptive paragraph, explain what you need, allowing the Job Seeker to understand what's involved. 
 Provide any measurements that you believe are relevant, including setting your job urgency to make it clear to any Job Seeker. 
 Parking available for the Job Seeker? You can indicate this here. Also, do you have any photos to upload to make it easier for the Job Seeker to understand what needs to be completed? You can upload 4 photos into your Job Post allowing the Job Seeker to visualise what you are looking to have undertaken - a picture tells a 1000 words. 
 
 Set your Timescales 
 
 You can set the length of time for your job post to be advertised, whether it's urgent and within 12 hours, or perhaps up to 30 days if you're looking to take time finding the right job seeker for you. 
 Define when you are looking for the job to start and finish. It's good to manage expectations up-front. As you know, getting a Job Seeker to work to timescales can be challenging, specifically if it's a common trade where diaries can be fully booked. 
 Specify the expected job start time if this is relevant for you. Moreover, you can indicate who makes first contact and specify the best contact time for you once you, the Job Poster, has awarded the Job. 
 
 Specify Your Requirements 
 
 Indicate the type of Job Seeker that you prefer to undertake your job. Perhaps an independent person who is looking to supplement their income - if the job is small, or perhaps a Sole Trader or a Company for the larger jobs. 
 You can specify whether you'd like the Job Seeker to be certified or qualified for the job. Not all jobs require qualifications - such as dog walking, but it's good for you to specify this up front to ensure Job Seekers who quote on your job have the necessary qualifications that you're looking for. 
 WorkLocally allows the Job Seeker to identify themselves to our Admin team, where we confirm the Job Seekers identity, address, company and VAT information on your behalf - Look out for the Green Thumbs Up! If you would prefer Job Seekers to be WorkLocally verified, for peace of mind, you can specify this in your job post. 
 
 Set your Budget 
 
 Do you have a job budget? If yes, you can indicate this in your job post. This will allow Job Seekers to understand whether they can work towards or under your specified budget. 
 Perhaps your budget is fixed price, a competitive quote, or maybe time and materials. You can specify this here within the budget form of your job post. We also allow you to indicate how the Job Seeker will be paid on job completion and whether a receipt is expected to be provided. 
 WorkLocally also allows you to indicate whether you would like to offer a discretionary bonus for a job well done. You can even set the percentage given your overall job budget if you wish too. This could encourage the Job Seeker to go the extra mile, to ensure you are perfectly satisfied with the job outcome.

 Receive Quotes 
 Receive Email Alerts 
 
 When a Job Seeker provides a quote on your Job Post you will receive an email alert directly to your registered email address. 
 Access your MyWorkLocally > Job Poster > My Jobs tab and click "View Job Seekers" to see the Job Seeker who has quoted on your job. From here, you can review the interested Job Seekers profile to see if they're the right person for you. 
 
 Compare Quotes 
 
 After posting a Job on WorkLocally, interested Job Seekers can start quoting directly on your job. You can drill down into your Job Post by clicking on "View Job Seekers" button located in your MyWorkLocally > Job Poster > My Jobs tab. 
 You can cross compare quotes received. Comparing quotes is an invaluable way to get a well-rounded view on your budget. 
 You can easily see an overview of interested Job Seekers along with previous WorkLocally verification endorsements (see the verification coins), which may give you peace-of-mind on Job Seeker interested in your job. For a more detailed view you can open the Public Profile of interested Job Seekers, to review previous feedback, qualifications and more. 
 
 Communicate with Job Seekers 
 
 Another great feature of WorkLocally is allowing you to communicate with interested Job Seekers from the "View Job Seekers" tab within your submitted Job Post. 
 You can either communicate 1-2-1 if you require further information, or if you change something in your job specification, you will be able to send a message from yourself to all interested Job Seekers. 
 If you feel that the interested Job Seeker isn't the right person for you, you can simply discount the Job Seeker from sending or receiving any further correspondence. 
 
 View Job Seekers Profile 
 
 Another great feature is the ability to drill down into an interested Job Seeker Public Profile, to review previous feedback, qualifications and more. 
 By clicking on "View Profile" from within "View Job Seekers" you will be able to review and evaluate previous feedback. You will also be able to see whether they have received any WorkLocally verifications. We always recommend looking out for the "Green Thumbs Up" icon, to give you the added peace-of-mind that the Job Seeker has gone through a WorkLocally screening process by our team. 
 A wealth of information is stored within the Job Seekers Public Profile. WorkLocally thoroughly recommends reviewing the Job Seekers Public Profile before awarding your Job Post to the Job Seeker. Reviewing and evaluating the Job Seekers Public Profile is a major advantage in undertaking a risk based assessment on whether you believe they're right for the job, based on previous feedback received. 
 
 Select the Right Quote for You 
 
 Once you feel that a competitive quote has been received and the Job Seekers Public Profile fits your Job Post, you can award your Job to the interested Job Seeker. 
 Simply select the Job Seeker by clicking on the radio button and click the "Award" button, an email will be sent directly to the interested Job Seeker congratulating them on being the successful Job Seeker. 
 Before proceeding any further, the Job Seeker will need to accept the job award, which will allow contact details to be exchanged between you and the Job Seeker. Once the Job Seeker has accepted your job award, you will be notified directly by email.

 Complete Job 
 Exchange Contact Details 
 
 When you award your Job to a successful Job Seeker, the next step would be for the Job Seeker to "Accept" the job award, prior to the Job Seeker being able to access your contact details. 
 From the beginning the Job Seeker will need to find your job from the job listing page and send your Job to their Job Seekers "MyWorkLocally" job basket tab. Once the Job Seeker quotes on your job, the job is automatically relocated from their "Job Basket" to the Job Seekers "Quoted Jobs" area. When you award your job to the Job Seeker, the job will automatically relocate from the Job Seekers "Quoted Jobs" into the "Awarded" tab, where the Job Seeker will be immediately notified by email. Once the Job Seeker accepts the job in their "Awarded" tab they will be able to gain access to your contact details, before making contact with you. 
 
 Arrange a Start Date & Time 
 
 Sit back, relax and wait for the Job Seeker to make contact, based on your contact preferences. When the Job Seeker makes contact, arrange a date-time for the Job Seeker to discuss the work schedule and ultimately to carry out the work to your satisfaction. 
 
 Meet the Job Seeker 
 
 After you have met the Job Seeker and they have sized up the job and confirmed everything is in good order, it's down to the Job Seeker to carry out the work on behalf of you. 
 
 Job Completed 
 
 Once the job has been completed to a high standard, please don't forget to access your "MyWorkLocally" - "Awarded" tab and click "Complete Job". 
 Your job will then automatically relocate from the awarded to completed tab for further review, before allowing you to eventually leave feedback on the Job Seeker. 
 
 Settle Payment Directly 
 
 The last and most important thing is to settle up on the agreed cost for a job well done! Please don't forget to ask for a receipt if previously indicated on your job description. 
 The Job Seekers' Public Profile should contain their payment preferences, so if it's anything other than paying with direct cash, please securely dispose of any payment information details after settling up.

 Provide Feedback 
 Rate Communication 
 
 After the job has been completed you will have the opportunity to review and rate the communication between yourself and the Job Seeker. Was the communication good or bad? Please leave appropriate feedback based on your personal experience in the feedback form. 
 
 Rate Online Quote 
 
 Was the quote provided to do the job fair and accurate for the level of work carried out? Or was the price provided not a true reflection on what was agreed through the job posting process? Please be fair and provide on your views in the feedback form. 
 
 Rate Timekeeping 
 
 How was the Job Seekers time keeping? Did they turn up when expected and was the 1-2-1 communication good or bad? Please rate the communication in the feedback form. 
 
 Rate Standard of Work 
 
 Would you agree that the standard of work carried out was to a high quality and to your satisfaction? Please indicate this in the feedback form after the job has been completed. 
 
 Rate Tidiness 
 
 How tidy was the Job Seeker? Did they keep the place safe and clean throughout the job process and clean up at the end of the day? Feel free to select the appropriate feedback against the Job Seeker and indicate this in the feedback form. 
 
 General Feedback 
 
 Provide any other feedback, good or bad that you feel relevant to the job. Remember it is important to keep your feedback fair and honest; it's always a good idea to try to resolve any issues directly with the Job Seeker before leaving bad feedback.

 Upgrade your Membership 
 Benefits of Upgrading 
 Below are some of the benefits of upgrading your membership. 
 Increase Job Quote Limit 
 The maximum amount that you can quote on a job will depend on the membership type that you choose. For Job Seekers looking to only quote on smaller jobs, the Bronze membership is not only free, but comes with many great WorkLocally features that could be perfect for all your needs. 
 For Job Seekers looking to quote on larger jobs, you may be more suited to a Silver or Gold membership. Remember, you can easily upgrade or downgrade your membership at any time, should you feel that a different membership type would suit your needs better. 
 Access Callback Jobs 
 Callback jobs are jobs submitted by a Job Poster looking for up to 7 interested Job Seekers to contact them directly to arrange a quote. 
 Whilst all membership types allow users to post a Callback job, only Silver and Gold members can register their interest in these Job Posts. 
 For those looking to access Callback Job leads then a Silver or Gold membership would be perfect for you. 
 Please note, you must be a verified WorkLocally member before you can quote on Callback Jobs. 
 If you are a commercial Job Seeker, you must be Company & VAT verified before you can quote on Callback Jobs. 
 If you are an independent Job Seeker, you must be Identity and Address verified before you can quote on Callback Jobs. 
 Get Email Alerts 
 One of the great benefits of upgrading to a Silver or Gold membership is that you will be able to set up email alerts tailored to your skills and area. 
 Once set up, you will automatically receive alerts on any new jobs posted in your area that match your skills, putting you in the best position to quote on and win jobs in your area. 
 View Jobs on Map 
 Upgrading to a Silver or Gold membership will allow you to view jobs that you have registered an interest in, quoted on, or jobs that have been awarded by the Job Poster, all on a geographical based map. 
 The map format allows you to quickly see where jobs are located and to plan your work schedules accordingly.
