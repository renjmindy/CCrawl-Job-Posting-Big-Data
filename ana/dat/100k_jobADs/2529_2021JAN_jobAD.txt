 This is one of the major things at stake in the election result. Biden-Harris want to increase H-1B and other foreign workers programs that destroy the jobs and lives of Americans. Trump has been trying to restrict the H1B program and aims to further restrict it. Kamala Harris is a sponsor of S386, which aims to put the job thieves first in line for green cards by eliminating the per country cap on worker based green cards, and doubling family joining. The H1B workers are mostly from her maternal homeland of India. 
 This job theft has been ongoing for decades, and it doesn’t just impact IT workers, but other professionals, as well - especially academics, because universities have no H1B caps. 
 Want an IT job to have better social distancing, or because you lost your job in the pandemic? Well, you are out of luck if you are an American and if Biden-Harris are declared the winners of the 2020 election. 
 This was 18 years ago, but these life and job destroying polices are still ongoing. For the many workers who have had their lives and careers destroyed by US immigration policy over the decades - time stands still. Some things can’t be fixed. Not everyone commits suicide directly, they may die of stress-induced heart disease, etc.: 
“ _In a Labor Day action to searchlight worker replacement practices contributing to the suicide of Bank of America technology worker Kevin Flanagan, members of a coalition of technology organizations will picket at the site of Kevin’s death; the Bank of America Concord Technology Center in Concord, CA on Monday, September 1 from 9 a.m. to noon 
(PRWEB) AUGUST 25, 2003 
FROM: Lee Perry collaborating with Hire American Citizens, No More H-1B, National Association for the Employment of Americans, The Organization for Rights of American Workers, and The Programmer's Guild 
TO: News Editors, Assignment Editors, Labor Writers, Financial Page Editors 
 SUBJECT:  Workers to Stage Labor Day Protest at Site of Worker 's Suicide 
In a Labor Day action to searchlight worker replacement practices contributing to the suicide of Bank of America technology worker Kevin Flanagan, members of a coalition of technology organizations will picket at the site of Kevin’s death; the Bank of America Concord Technology Center in Concord, CA on Monday, September 1 from 9 a.m. to noon. 
 The picketers represent hundreds of thousands of technology service sector workers laid off and replaced by imported workers through the H-1B and L1 nonimmigrant visa program and offshore outsourcing. The group considers the huge multi-national to be a major offender. 
 Flanagan Took Own Life After Firing 
 " The pressure to reduce workers' wages and rights due to government subsidized labor creates terrible desperation in the work force," said protest organizer Lee Perry, "expressed to its ultimate degree by Kevin Flanagan, who took his own life earlier this year after training H-1B replacements for his work group and then getting a pink slip. 
 " The 'Great American Job Giveaway' is one of the main reasons for the record income tax shortfalls, foreclosures, bankruptcies, and continuing recession," Perry stated. "It is destroying the US technology sector and creating national security issues. 
 "We must educate the public on the impact of these practices. Labor Day, celebrating the contribution of working people, particularly the immigrants who adopted the American dream, is the right time to do it." 
 Statistics Show Outsourcing a National Emergency 
 There are over 1 million American IT workers on the street looking for work or underemployed; meanwhile there are over 1.5 million foreign H-1B and L-1 IT workers in the U.S. H-1B and L-1 visa holders are temporary non-immigrant foreign workers working in the U.S. Last year, 9 out of 10 American IT jobs went to H-1B and L-1 workers. 
 In the next 18 months, 1 out of 10 American technology jobs will be moved offshore. Off-shoring is a combination of H-1B and L-1 workers here and / or foreign workers abroad. The H-1B and L-1 visa holders are trained by Americans and replace them on the job when the Americans are laid off. The Indian off-shoring firms have stated publicly that off-shoring depends crucially on H-1B and L-1 visas. These jobs will never come back. We must act now to save the future of American technology jobs. 
 " When manufacturing jobs were sold abroad we were told Information Technology service jobs would replace them. Now that the IT jobs are on the auction block, it is spreading to other services such as teaching, nursing, radiology, accounting, law, architecture and the service jobs that account for 75% of our income tax revenue" , Perry continued. "If we don't stop this unlimited labor importation and the outflow of jobs from outsourcing, our children will be forced to compete for their jobs against a third world used to a lower standard of living. Congress, the Courts, and the White House are selling our future by supplying cheap labor to the multinational corporations who are their major campaign contributors. 
 If the corporatists succeed in bringing the American economy down to the level of Asia, our sovereignty as a nation may be but a dim memory. We encourage everyone to join us to send the message to Washington that this must stop now 
 
 (Participants will meet at the corner of Grant Street and Concord Blvd. in Concord, CA at 9:00 a.m. The organizers will be available there at 8:00 a.m. 
The protest is being sponsored by a coalition of organizations including: Hire American Citizens ( http://web.archive.org/web/20030127013428/http://www.hireamericancitizens.org/ ), No More H-1B ( https://archive.is/GbzYf ), National Association for the Employment of Americans ( https://archive.is/MkMvv ), The Organization for Rights of American Worker, and The Programmer's Guild ( https://archive.is/ZdzND ), all of which, and more, may be found on  http://www.American-Champions . org ( https://web.archive.org/web/20031231141307/http://www.american-champions.org/ ) _".  https://archive.is/lG6JV 
 U.S. Tech Workers @USTechWorkers, Nov 6: 
 " _Laid off JC Penney worker is told “learn to code”. 
 JCP worker learns to code. 
 Biden admin allows for more H-1B visa issuances. 
 JCP worker is told to train his/her H-1B foreign replacement & then fired. 
 JCP worker complains. Admin says “shut up you xenophobe!”_ 
 
 To be clear, what Rahm Emanuel has said here is offensive. “Learn to code” is the modern version of “let them eat cake”. It’s also ableist - is everyone capable of learning to code? 
 -- U.S. Tech Workers (@USTechWorkers)  November 7, 2020 
 
 
 Democratic bigwig Rahm Emanuel says gov't should train retail workers 'to code.' 
Does he not know the feds provide at least 1.3 million foreign staffers to tech CEOs b/c those CEOs prefer compliant & immobile foreign workers? 
We need better bigwigs.  #H1B https://t.co/RvYFWTjGyf
