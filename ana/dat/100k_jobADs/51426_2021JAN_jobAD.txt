 Development Lead / CTO 
 Grexie is a social networking startup bringing social networking into the physical world. With groups, events and traditional social networking capabilities, we're looking to disrupt the industry and bring about change. 
 What we're looking for 
 We're looking for someone versed in Node.js, React / React Native and GraphQL to take the lead on developing the MVP ready for product launch. Desirable but non-essential skills include AWS (ECS, S3, Terraform, Docker, CircleCI) and AWS Neptune. Any previous experience with Graph Databases will come in handy too. 
 We're looking for UK/US applicants only in a GMT (London) timezone. Ideally you'll be placed as close as possible to Manchester so we can have face to face meetings, but this isn't a necessity. 
 What you'll receive 
 We're a pre-seed startup right now so we don't have the funds to pay you. You should ideally have a day job that can support your living costs, and we'll provide you with a substantial equity stake to keep you invested in the business. 
 When will this turn into a paid position? 
 As soon as we have the MVP ready, we'll be going out to find investment, at this point you can expect to earn the top end of salaries within the business together with your equity stake as a full time position.
