 _This is another freelance contribution by  Sally Keys . You may remember her from her recent freelance contribution,  How Creative Writing Can Boost Your Intelligence . Sally is a professional freelance writer with many years experience across many different areas. She made the move to freelancing from a stressful corporate job and loves the work-life balance it offers her. When not at work, she enjoys reading, hiking, spending time with her family, and traveling as much as possible. _ 
 As things are quite tough for many of us, I thought this could be a perfect post for the struggling artists among us! 
 Financially Support Your Writing Career Without Leaving Your Laptop

 With a reported  45,000 writers and authors  in 2017 working in the U.S alone, it's clear to see why writing is an industry renowned for being competitive. Thatâ€™s not to say that as a novice or longtime writer you should give up on your passion. Whether youâ€™re seeking to write a childrenâ€™s book,  increase your intelligence through creative writing projects  or be the best blogger in town, initially, you may not see the money flowing in from your writing endeavors. Do not despair, though, as there are plenty of options to earn money while you reap the rewards from your writing, and the more open-minded you are, the more options youâ€™ll have. 
 Use your creative skills 
 You're a writer, so you have an abundance of creative skills that you can utilize to make money. You could pen slogans by creating snappy one-liners, publishing them, and wait for others to pay for them. There are different websites which offer such a service and itâ€™s quick (ensuring no writerâ€™s block), simple, and you can do it where ever you like so long as the wi-fi works. If that isnâ€™t your thing, then how about selling your photos? Again, itâ€™s easy to  take them and download them online  and wait while others pick one of yours because it represents exactly what they need. 
 Expand your passion for reading 
 If you have written a book and you want to expand to the audiobook market, which is gaining popularity, there are ways you can either record your own book. You can also audition someone to do it for you. Alternatively, you can set up your own account to apply to be a reader for audiobooks. Usually, doing this will require acting or audiobook experience, but you may be a natural who passes auditions with ease and gets paid to read. 
 Try investments or rent out things you own 
 Perhaps youâ€™ve had enough of being creative as the writing takes it all and leaves you with very little, so how about financial investments? You could acquire part of a company that is already up and running by investing in a dividend-paying stock which will give you a portion of the profits. Just ensure that you do your research before you to open up a stock-investing account! 
 Or you could join the growing trend of  renting out your car . If you have a car that often sits all day without use, then you just may want to consider renting it when you arenâ€™t using it and being paid for it. Alternatively, you may have a spare room to rent or you could rent your property if you are away using Airbnb. 
 Flexible working when it suits you 
 Amazon now offers a service called Mechanical Turk which  allows you to complete Human Intelligence Tasks  (HITs). These are small and simple enough tasks. Even though they don't pay a lot, numerous jobs can generate income. There is a list which outlines the tasks available and each will show the timeframe for completion and the pay, so it may be worth checking it out and applying to be a worker. 
 Whatever you chose to do to earn money while you write, there are many options available. Some may suit your lifestyle or skills more than others, but you need to be willing to build up your money earning opportunities by trying new things. You may even take a few risks or do something you didn't think you would, but if it allows you to write then surely it's worth trying?
