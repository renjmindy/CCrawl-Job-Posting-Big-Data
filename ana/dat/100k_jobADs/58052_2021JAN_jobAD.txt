 Being a flower girl is a pretty important job, but as a little kid, it can feel like a daunting task. Having a whole crowd of people staring at you can be overwhelming for anyone, let alone a little kid. 
 So when this girl just couldn"t bring herself to walk down the aisle ahead of the bride, a hilarious replacement stepped in to save the day. 
 (via YouTube) 
 Dads are always there to pick us up when we"re down. I"m sure this girl will get another chance at flower girl greatness, but in this case, Daddy did an excellent job filling her tiny shoes.
