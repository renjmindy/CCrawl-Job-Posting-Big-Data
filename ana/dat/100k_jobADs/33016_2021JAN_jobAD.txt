 I might be dating myself, but are you familar with Usenet? Usenet was the original "My Space," an open internet forum where people can meet to discuss ideas. It was created in 1979 and some recruiters used it shortly thereafter to recruit technical candidates. (Check out "The History of Sourcing") Well today it still exists, but its called "Google Groups." I skimmed through the forums and discovered that there were lots of places to post free jobs to a general audience and to a regionally targeted audience as well. Below is a list of all the ones I found. 
 100+ Places to post (and search) jobs for free 
 The good thing about the list is that its a free resource. The bad news is that many of these forums are a haven for spammers and I don't know how trafficked they are but hey, you get what you pay for. (Smile) Check them out for yourself and let me know what you think?
