 Fired From Your HR Job, It Doesn't Exist In 2022 Future 
 Posted on  August 14, 2020  by  akin Adeleye   One comment 
 This is year 2022 and Coronavirus has drastically reshaped the economy and the labor force. I am therefore directed to inform you, that you are fired from your HR job. It doesn't exist in this 2022 future. 
 Since Coronavirus rapid spread around the globe, we have experienced titanic shifts in how we work, where we work, and the technologies we use to stay connected. 
 
 " **  We believe this is HR’s moment to lead organizations in navigating the future. ** " 
 
 Such massive change is  escalating the importance of HR’s role  within organizations. Workers are turning to their managers and their HR leaders, in particular, for guidance on how to navigate their “new normal”. 
 Research indicates that  73%  of workers depend on their employer for support in preparing for the future of work. 
 Your Chance To Survive The Future, Before You 're Fired From Your HR Job 
 Just as  CFOs  have greatly increased their scope since the 2008 financial crisis, CHRO’s now have that same opportunity to become central C-suite players. 
 We believe this is HR’s moment to lead organizations in navigating the future. They have a tremendous opportunity, and responsibility, to provide workers with guidance. With change, people need help on the skills and capabilities they will need to be successful over the next decade as new roles continue to emerge. 
 Work-life, The Future of Work and Future Workplace 
 With that in mind, The Cognizant Center for Future of Work and Future Workplace jointly embarked on a nine-month initiative. This is to determine exactly what the future of HR will look like. 
 The Center brought together the Future Workplace network of nearly 100 CHROs, CLOs, and VP’s of talent and workforce transformation. Their job was to envision how HR’s role might evolve over the next 10 years. 
 
 " The 2020s will be a reset moment for HR." 
 
 Their brainstorm considered economic, political, demographic, societal, cultural, business, and technology trends.

 New Future Deal For HR - Starting From Over 60 New Future HR Jobs 
 The result was the conception of over 60 new HR jobs. It included detailed responsibilities and skills needed to succeed in each role. Each job was then ranked by its organizational impact. **** This narrowed the list to an initial 21 HR jobs of the future. 
 The Process:  HR jobs were arranged on a 2×2 grid; the X-axis depicts time - over the next 10 years. Y-axis depicts “technology centricity”; that is, all jobs will utilize innovative technologies, but only the most tech-centric will actually require a grounding in computer science. 
 
 " Before it can be built, it has to be dreamed." 
 
 The advent of Covid-19 compressed time like an accordion. A handful of these roles became “jobs of the now.” The 2020s will be a reset moment for HR. The Center in their report, fully expect to see more examples of these theoretical “jobs-made-real,” by visionary leaders in the coming months and years. 
 Five Core Themes Of The  Top 21 HR Jobs of The Future 
 While some of the roles identified are entirely new positions, others are new responsibilities. They are becoming increasingly important as HR re-imagines and reboots its strategy in light of the pandemic. All 21 jobs embody five core themes that the Center came across in their research. 
 They are individual and organizational resilience, organizational trust and safety, creativity and innovation, data literacy and human-machine partnerships. 
 The Human-Human Relation Themes 
 **Individual and organizational resilience.  **The future of work will include developing a stronger focus and a more holistic view of employee wellbeing. One that encompasses the emotional, mental and spiritual health of workers along with the physical. 
 Even before the virus,  Gallup reported  two thirds of full-time workers experienced burnout on the job. 
 **Organizational trust and safety.  **HR professionals are in a unique position to be guardians and models of an ethical and responsible workplace. As organizations invest in digital transformation initiatives and establish a “data culture,” the Center believe the expectations to uphold this responsibility will increase. 
 LinkedIn research found that 67% of hiring managers and recruiters  said AI saves them time  as they source job candidates. But questions are now being raised around this technology and its potential for bias, inaccuracy, and lack of transparency. 
 **Creativity and innovation.  **As business leaders envision new ways to grow their organizations in the midst of rapid change, a new role at the intersection of corporate strategy and HR must arise. 
 The Future of Work Leader  , would be responsible for analyzing what skills will be most essential as the workforce continues to evolve. 
 The Human-Machine Relations Themes 
 **Data literacy.  **Currently, only a few HR functions are building analytics capabilities into their teams to solve key people challenges. This could be uncovering why one team performs better than another. Or how their organization can create a more diverse and inclusive culture. 
 In the future, HR teams will be a more data-driven function. Doing so would allow them to provide more accurate insights for engagement of C-suite leaders. 
 **Human-machine partnerships.  **As the use of robots in companies continues to increase, it has become apparent that there is a need for human-machine collaboration in the workforce. Judgment is usually easy for humans, but still hard for computers. 
 Sorting out the balance of the “art of the job” (for humans) vs. the “science of the job” (for bots) will likely result in the creation of new HR roles. Such will be focused on how both can work together intuitively.

 The Closing  Before You're Fired From Your HR Job Into Other Future HR Jobs 
 As new and existing roles evolve, the most successful organizations and individuals will have a clear understanding of what needs to change; what must change to meet future business priorities (both anticipated and unanticipated). 
 This is worth repeating, a handful of these roles have become “jobs of the now.” 
 You never know — one day soon,   you   might be recruiting someone to fill any of these 21 jobs. You may also be doing one yourself, if you escape being fired from your HR job.
