 Dear Sir/Madam, 
 Sub: Job as a part-time CAREGIVER/full time 
 I would like to apply for the job of a part-time CAREGIVER, 
 My previous jobs include two years as a Caregiver in Israel and Nepal . This has given me experience of dealing with customers and family , as well as computer skill and knowledge of food making. I have been living in London since last February, and am currently studying English at a language school. I have good English communication skills. My fluency in HIBREW may be useful when Israel family. I am an enthusiastic worker, and enjoy working in a family. My student visa entitles me to work up to 20 hours per week (or longer during my school holidays), and I could start work immediately. 
 I would welcome the opportunity to discuss the job vacancy with you on the telephone or at an interview. I can be contacted most easily on my mobile telephone or by e-mail (see details at the top of this letter). 
 Yours faithfully, 
 Amita Sunuwar
