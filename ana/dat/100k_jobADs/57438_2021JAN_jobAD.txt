  Discover The Inner Workings Of A Psychologist Career  
 JustJobs.com 
 January 26, 2013 
   
 This is a true story as told to JustJobs Academy  which houses career interviews and job search advice for professionals in any industry. Visit to read about how to  find the perfect job  and  how to get promoted  once you land it.  Are you interested in a  psychologist career ? I am a licensed psychologist. I have worked in the social services field for more than two decades and have been licensed as a psychologist for close to two decades. I have two graduate degrees, including a MA in Counseling Psychology and a PhD in Clinical Psychology. Currently, I am in private practice, but I contract my services with several agencies, including the police department, corrections, child services, Veterans Affairs and a community-based counseling center. I see individuals, families and couples for private sessions and also facilitate group sessions. Psychologists do more than just talk to people in their offices in private therapy. They also work in a wide variety of settings and help people with all kinds of issues. Over the years, I have worked extensively in school settings. Frequently, psychologists help identify learning and developmental disabilities for children from preschool to high school age. Although much of what a psychologist does is similar to a Marriage and Family Therapist or social worker, there are definite distinctions. A psychologist is able to perform many diagnostic tests that other mental health professionals are not qualified to give to clients. Marriage and Family Therapists primarily provide counseling services and social workers help people and families with the services they need for healthy functioning, such as housing and access to medical care. Frequently, people confuse psychologists with psychiatrists. Psychologists are not medical doctors. I do not have the ability to write prescriptions for medication, although I have a great deal of education and training about medications and medical conditions that can affect mental health. Psychologists provide diagnosis and counseling services. Psychiatrists provide medication and medical treatment. I commonly consult with psychiatrists regarding medication and physical health and I frequently receive referrals from psychiatrists for counseling services for their patients. One of the things I enjoy the most about my work is the variety of people I work with. Much of my work is now focused on helping people cope with trauma. I work with returning soldiers with the Department of Veterans Affairs, helping them reintegrate into civilian life and identifying problems such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety. I also work with the local police department with officers involved in shootings and other violent events. Through the state’s Victim-Witness Program, I work with clients who have witnessed or been involved in domestic violence, rape, robbery, violent accidents and all kinds of other life events. I also work with families integrating new family members or blending into a new family group, couples who are getting married, college students who are sorting out their sexual identity and children learning to deal with school problems. These are just a few of the kinds of people and issues I see in my office every day. When I first began working in the field, I worked with individuals and families facing chronic and life threatening illness. Over the years, as my interests have changed and evolved, I have been able to also draw clients who reflect those interests. As my skills have improved or I have gained new tools to use as interventions, I have also been able to broaden the types of clients I work with and the agencies I work with. Most states require psychologists to have a doctorate-level degree and many hours of supervised internship as part of licensing. Licensing requirements vary from state to state and some states only require a Master’s degree for licensing. Almost all states require sitting for licensing exams. In my case, there were two exams required before my license was granted. In addition to my degrees, I also have several postgraduate certificates, which has helped me provide services to a larger number of agencies. One thing that has really helped me is the variety of settings I was able to serve my  internships  at. In my state, 3,000 hours of supervised internship were required and many of these intern settings were volunteer unpaid positions. However, by taking advantage of opportunities, I was able to stretch and learn new things. I worked at several programs providing services to homeless children and domestic violence victims. I also worked with college students, providing diagnostic services for learning disabilities. One of my most rewarding assignments was working a suicide hotline for veterans, which provided me with tremendous insight into the things soldiers face when they return from deployments. What I have discovered over the years is each step in my learning as a psychologist provides me with a new set of skills that I continue to use throughout my career. One of the things I have had to learn the hard way in my private practice is basic business skills. As the mental health field has changed, I have had to learn how to do my own marketing to grow my business and solicit clients. Gone are the days of simply signing up with a number of insurance companies and letting it be known you are in business. Today, I spend time posting articles online on article directories, talking on Twitter and posting on my Facebook page. I have to work to establish myself as an authority in my field because clients are more savvy and research providers before scheduling appointments. I have also had to learn about managing my own finances. I submit my own claims to health insurance companies and invoices to clients who do not use insurance. I have also had to learn how to work with insurance companies and inform potential new clients about the advantages and disadvantages of using health insurance for their mental health services. One thing I am thankful for in my past is my volunteer work. By working in the social services arena first, I had a good idea of what I was getting myself into when I decided to become a psychologist. I had a good basic understanding of both the joy and the challenges of working with people in emotional distress. Photo Credit:  Shutterstock

  An Inside Look at a Career in Nursing  
 JustJobs.com 
 November 18, 2012 
   
 This is a true story as told to JustJobs Academy  which houses career interviews and job search advice for professionals in any industry. Visit to read about how to cultivate a sense of doubt and avoid interruptions on the job.  I am currently a  nurse  at a hospital in the city I live in. I work in all departments, but my favorite area is obstetrics. I have worked in this field for 10 years. The work that I do varies with the department that I work in. If I am in the emergency department, I may help with gunshot victims or people who have had a heart attack. If I am in the obstetrics department, I help the doctors in the delivery room, and then I help take care of the babies after they are born. Some people think that when you go into the nursing field, you can have your choice of what area you want to work in. Some areas have a waiting list of people who want to work there, and there are some departments that require you to have a certain amount of experience. On a scale of one to 10, I would say that my job satisfaction is an eight. I love what I do, but I would like to be on a better schedule. Sometimes I only work on the weekends for 12 hours, and that makes it hard to plan things I want to do with my family. There are several things that I have seen that move my heart. I have seen babies born to mothers who pass away. There have been patients who have been on the brink of death that have been resuscitated, and there have been the people helped who truly are thankful for the care they receive. I know that I have found my calling. I would not change anything about the area I work in. I got started in nursing when I was in high school. I received my certification as a nursing assistant, and then I went to college to be a nurse. If I could do things differently, I think that I would have gone on to be a doctor instead of just a nurse. One of the things that I have learned the hard way about being a nurse is that there is a lot of pain in the world. There are people who need healthcare, but they don’t have the insurance to get the help they need. If they can’t pay for the services they need, many of the patients are sent home with a prescription they can’t afford to get. There are also people who come in the hospital with little left to live for, and they need the encouragement that only a professional can offer. Working is hard work. If you want to have a great  career , you are going to have to put forth the effort instead of just letting someone else do the work for you. As I was working in the emergency room one evening, there was a man who came in with no clothes on and ranting about not knowing where he was. It was sad to see him like this, but I have never seen anything like it before, and it has been the strangest thing up until this point I have witnessed on the job. The reason I go to work each day is to make a difference in someone else’s life. When I help deliver a baby and see the bond between the mother and child, I know that my job has been done. Sometimes there are patients you deal with that are hostile and angry. They may be in so much pain that they can’t control how they act, but they still drive you to the point of wondering if the job is worth it. Overall, my job is not that stressful. However, there are some situations where you have to think quickly. When there are people who are having a stroke in front of your eyes, or you see patients who cannot breathe and you don’t know if they are going to make it really brings the stress level up. I have to take some time outside and get a deep breath before I continue my job. I believe I am paid enough for what I do. Right now, I make about $25 an hour. This is more than enough to live the life that I have, and I can support myself and my children. I take about two weeks of vacation during the year. There are times when I have to work on holidays. I don’t like this, but the patients need someone to care for them. To be a nurse, I had to go to school for two years. It was hard to get into the nursing program, but after I completed my basic classes, I could go right into the nursing courses without the extra classwork. If a friend were interested in being a nurse, I would tell them to be prepared for hard work and hard classes in  college . It is not the easy job that many people think it is, but it is one of the most rewarding jobs. In five years, I would like to be working in one department of the hospital instead of changing areas each week. I would like to work in the obstetrics or pediatrics department.

  Are You Cut Out for a Job in Politics?

 This is a true story told to LatPro.com , the worldwide leader in providing online employment resources for Hispanic and bilingual professionals since 1997. With 95 of the Fortune 100 companies using its service, LatPro is the largest diversity employment site in the U.S. and the most complete personal career advancement service for Latino and bilingual professionals. Visit to find careers in your field specifically tailored for Hispanic and bilingual professionals like yourself.  I am the mayor of the town of Irmo, South Carolina. I have six years of  political  experience. I was elected to the Irmo Town Council in 2005, re-elected in 2009, and then elected as Mayor in 2011 for a four-year term. I make decisions with a council of five members in regards to the town of Irmo. We discuss and vote on the various issues that arise. Some people may find it surprising that in our form of government, called a council-form, the mayor is only one vote; he has no more power than other council members. On a scale of one to ten I would rate my job as a five. In order to unleash my full enthusiasm I would like to see the attitudes of other council members become more desirous to do what is best for our town, and not for themselves. This job does move me in that I feel like I am exactly where I am supposed to be at this time in my life. I like being in this position, as I can truly be a voice for the people of my town, and do what is in my authority to effect change where change is necessary. Two of the other council members I am now serving with also ran for mayor in November 2011, and lost to me. Another council member who just got elected again was defeated and unseated by me in 2005 when I first got elected to serve on Town Council. I prayed months ago for God to make me a humble man and teach me patience. Wow, was my timing good or what? I got into this line of work due to a long desire to be involved in  politics . Unfortunately, in the world of politics some lessons are learned the hard way. In my case, I learned that campaigns have consequences; so does telling the truth. You enter this field thinking that your colleagues are all on the same page, and that they too have entered the world of politics because they want to help people. It is disheartening when you learn that most people simply enjoy having the power associated with the position and have no intention to serve the people of their town. The strangest thing that has ever happened to me in this job is being addressed as “honorable” just because I got elected. I get up and go to work each day for most of the same reasons everyone else in the working world does: I have a family to support and bills to pay, but at the same time, I do desire to be part of the solution in my community rather than the problem, and I believe that I will have more resources and power behind my voice to see that positive changes are made in my community. I think it is really neat that I can be a part of that whole process. I deal with a number of stressful challenges each day, from cronyism and egos to political issues, neighborhood issues, neighbors, contributors, apathy, and low voter turnout. While these things may sound negative, if you are steered by the right type of motivation, then all things can work together for good. A rough salary for my position is approximately $550 per month plus expenses. Obviously this is not very much money, and I do not believe I am paid nearly enough for the amount of work I do each day. However, I also have a full time job which allows me to live comfortably and provide for my family. Aside from my  job in politics  , I am a business owner, so I am working all the time. I do not take any vacation time unless it is absolutely necessary. If a friend was contemplating entering this line of work I would tell him or her not to do it unless he or she had a sincere desire to use the gained “power” for the good of the community. I would also communicate that common sense, good communication skills, and attention to detail will all help you succeed in the field of politics. If I could write my own ticket, I would like to be running political campaigns for others, political lobbying, and expanding my other business in five years.  Image Credit: Shutterstock

  My Experience Working Abroad

I have  worked  in the tour guide business in Egypt for one year and consider it to be one of the greatest memories of my life. Packing your bags and moving oversees may seem like a big step, however, things fall nicely into place once you get your boots on the ground. I was based in Cairo and shared a spacious apartment with a French woman who worked for the Coca Cola Company downtown. Though the tour guide business in Egypt demands long and irregular hours, life was pleasant along the river Nile and I met some fascinating and wonderful people. The tour guide trade opens the door to new people and cultures, making this a fantastic long or short-term  working abroad  experience. The best part about a tour guide career is that no two days are exactly alike. This type of work is ideal for those who thrive on the adrenaline of the unexpected and can make friends easily under pressure. My day could usurp morning, noon, and night with guided tours and often required long waits at the airport for incoming tour group clients. The first step is to meet and greet the guests, get them through customs and assist them at the hotel for check-in. My college undergrad was in Criminal Justice; however, I took eighteen units of Hospitality Management and some tour guide classes. I also speak, read and write fluent German and have learned basic conversational Egyptian Arabic. Bilingual skills are necessary for foreign tour guide services, however, becoming a multi-lingual guide will increase your job prospects and send you to the front of the line. My tour groups were usually about fifteen to thirty visitors, and on a few occasions, I had only one small party traveling together. My clients received a written outline of their itinerary from the main office and they could expect a three to four hour tour of Cairo each day. The main events were always The Egyptian Museum, The Great Pyramid, Sphinx, Solar Boat Museum, and a drop-off at the Khan el-Khalili souk for a self-guided tour through the shops. In addition to the standard points of interests in the city, my clients were able to book additional sightseeing with me for extended tours such as a day trip to Alexandria, an excursion to Dashur, or a special night out on the town aboard a Nile dinner cruise ship. Although being a tour guide appears to be a very structured line of work, it has its elements of surprise that requires some quick thinking on your feet. I would give my cell phone number to my clients and urged them to call me if they had any travel difficulties, would like to arrange something special, or if they needed some fast facts on adjusting to life in Egypt. To connect well and establish an instant rapport with foreign travelers, it is essential to possess a high level of people skills. Though the pressure could be intense dealing with late drivers, combative clients or juggling last minute reservations, I kept going with a smile because I knew I was appreciated and applauded by the majority of my guests. No matter how hot and bothered some of my clients would be, I always remembered that they might have had to save their money for years to take a fabulous trip to Egypt, and my pride and joy was making their Cairo experience a pleasant one. The academic side for training in this exciting field does not communicate the hard work and energy that the tour guide business requires. It may not be brain surgery, but it does require a quick and sharp mind to problem solve for each unique individual on the tour and spin a lot of wheels to keep the group activities interesting and entertaining. At the end of the tour in Cairo, most of my clients would be moving on to Luxor or Aswan to board a Nile cruise ship, then perhaps spend a few days on the beaches at The Red Sea. However, this is not goodbye as they will return to Cairo for the final one or two days of their itinerary. My clients were briefed on the proper etiquette for tipping in Egypt, which was approximately fifteen Egyptian pounds per person, per day. I knew I was not going to get rich working as a tour guide in Cairo, however the base pay was decent and the tips were excellent. The bonus to the job was having some free time in Egypt and exploring the country from top to bottom on my own. I was given drastically reduced hotel rates, low airfare and train tickets, and was able to see Egypt at my own pace with two five-day vacations over the year. My best advice to someone considering a tour guide position abroad is to choose a country that interests you and let your passion for travel lead the way. In addition, get the best education you can and get busy with one or more foreign languages. I got started in this line of work from hearing a friend rave about her tour guide job in New York City and decided to make it happen for myself in my beloved Egypt. Since I left my  job  in Cairo, life has become more complicated with ties to the United States. This confirms that my timing was right to chase the dream, board the plane, and create some priceless memories overseas. If you are feeling the pull to do something different with your life, I say now is the time to make it happen.  Working abroad image paul prescott  /  Shutterstock.com

  Career Choice: Working As A Physical Therapist

 _This is a true story told to LatPro.com , the worldwide leader in providing online employment resources for Hispanic and bilingual professionals since 1997. With 95 of the Fortune 100 companies using its service, LatPro is the largest diversity employment site in the U.S. and the most complete personal career advancement service for Latino and bilingual professionals. Visit to find careers in your field specifically tailored for Hispanic and bilingual professionals like yourself. _ I am a physical therapist  working  at a large metropolitan hospital. I've had my current job for two years, and I've worked as a physical therapist for a total of five years. I work full time, 40 hours weekly, with occasional overtime. I chose to get started in physical therapy because I love to move and be active. I wanted a way to channel my energy while also making a difference in the life of another person. 
 Working As A Physical Therapist 
 At my job, I help hospitalized patients restore as much function and movement as possible. Some of these patients have become permanently disabled and are just beginning a long journey towards coping with and finding ways around their new injuries. Some patients are not permanently disabled, but have become weakened by long hospital stays (for instance, a month's stint in the ICU will leave many unable to walk without physical therapy, due to muscle atrophy.) Because I work in a hospital, my patients are often very sick, and the work has to be tailored to their energy levels and current capabilities. I love my job, and if given the choice, I would do this again. I rate my job satisfaction as a 9 out of 10. However, physical therapists have to endure quite a long haul. You're not going to see major changes in your patients overnight, especially if you choose to work in a hospital instead of an outpatient clinic. Some physical therapists can find the slow pace of progress a little frustrating, but to me there's nothing more rewarding than having one of your old patients walk through the doors of your gym on their own two feet. One of my proudest moments was when a previous patient, a young man who had lost a leg in a motorcycle accident, came into our waiting room pushing a cart of flowers and pizza for the staff all by himself. These are the kind of moments that are precious, and they're worth every minute I spend with my patients. Physical therapy is not all flowers and pizza, however. The biggest challenge I've faced is learning how to push my patients to meet their limits without exceeding them. Sometimes I have to push my patients to work harder than they think they can work. Even healthy people have a hard time pushing themselves to  workout  daily. If you think getting motivated to visit the gym is hard, imagine you have to do it while recovering from a serious injury or illness! Finding the right balance between being sympathetic and being demanding has been difficult, and it's never an exact science. A physical therapy gym often has a very warm, friendly atmosphere to it. This helps reduce stress and makes me look forward to going to work in the morning. There's a real sense of community among the patients and their physical therapists. You get to know everyone very well, and the patients encourage each other and update each other on their progress. However, there are some significant sources of stress as well. Some people have a hard time understanding that learning how to become independently mobile again is a long process. I sometimes have very angry family members demanding to know why their relative "still can't walk." One thing I've learned the hard way is that this job can be as hard on your muscles as it is on a patient's muscles! Physical therapy does have a high rate of workplace injury, because we lift and move people all the time. I injured my rotator cuff on the job when I caught a patient who tripped, and ended up needing a little physical therapy myself. I feel adequately compensated for my job. The average salary is around $70,000 a year, and many physical therapists (myself included) get great benefits. I usually get around 2-3 weeks paid vacation a year. Another perk is that we are very much in demand! The population of the United States is becoming increasingly elderly, which means that more physical therapists will be needed in the future to help people suffering from age-related illnesses and injuries. However, physical therapy recently changed from requiring a master's degree to requiring completion of a doctoral program, the Doctor of Physical Therapy. This is not as daunting as it sounds, as it only increased training from two years to three or four (depending on the program), but it's still something to consider. If someone was considering physical therapy as their  career choice , my advice would be to shadow a physical therapist for a few days and see what their job is like. You can call hospitals or physical therapy clinics and ask for an opportunity to shadow. It's a good idea to shadow a range of physical therapists (inpatient, outpatient, and at-home) to get a feel for what the different jobs entail. The single most important thing I've learned from my job is patience. The good things in life don't come easy, but if you work hard, they will happen!

  Teaching Music: Is it the Right Career for You?

 This is a true story as told to JustJobs Academy  which houses career interviews and job search advice for professionals in any industry. Visit to read about how to  improve your people skills  and e-mail outreach on the job.  I am a piano  teacher  and also the owner of Kane Piano Studio. I have more than 30 years of experience in this field. My clientele consists of more than 40 students, and I employ two other teachers who also teach students for me. Each of my students receives a private lesson of 30 minutes each week. Most of my students participate in a New York State test of their ability, and we hold an annual recital every June. A common misunderstanding in my field is that it is easy, and that you only have to know how to play the piano in order to know how to ‘teach’ piano. I would rate my overall job satisfaction at about a 6. The students of today are involved in far too many extra-curricular activities. As a result, they cannot possibly dedicate a regular amount of time daily (at least 30 minutes) to practice and to achieve satisfactory results. To improve job satisfaction I would want to drop those students who do not practice regularly due to lack of interest or because they are overextended with activities. Sometimes, I feel like I have found my calling when a student shows sincere appreciation once they have successfully learned how to play a particular piece or have performed well. I then know I have done my job well. I started teaching music privately after college. I subbed during the day and taught at a music studio after school hours. The money was better so I decided to teach privately and not in a public school setting. That was a mistake. I went for the better money right away instead of looking down the road for my later years. Now I have no retirement, no pension. I would probably have been retired by now and teaching privately had I taught classroom music instead. One thing I have learned the hard way outside of the classroom is that the saying, "It is not always 'what' you know, but 'who' you know," is true of just about any profession in terms of getting into and succeeding in a certain area. Nothing actually strange has happened during my  career , but little kids will often say whatever is on their mind – they do not filter things out. I am sure some parents would be appalled by what their children have shared with me over the years. I get up and go to work each day because I am not the kind of person who can remain idle for too long, and because I have a family to support and bills to pay. But on the other side of the coin, I do enjoy what I do and look forward to what each new day brings. The biggest challenge I am confronted with on a regular basis is getting the students to commit to practicing each day. It can be very frustrating to have to say the same thing over and over, week after week, and see no improvement. There is definitely stress involved in my  job . Trying to keep the parents happy even when their children are not doing their jobs can become extremely stressful. The parents simply do not want to hear it. For some reason, a child’s lack of success is usually blamed on the teacher and not the child’s lack of commitment and dedication. I make $30 per 30-minute session, which is the going rate for a degreed instructor in my geographic location. I am fortunate to make such good money, but I do have a bachelor's and master’s degree in this field, a great deal of experience, and I have been told on numerous occasions that I am a good teacher. To get into this industry and succeed, one needs a minimum of a bachelor’s degree in music education. My advice to a friend who was looking to get into this field would be to start your career in the classroom and then have a private clientele on the side. As I mentioned, I made the mistake of doing it in the opposite direction. I should be enjoying my retirement years at this point in my life. If I had started in the school system as a music teacher I would be able to retire comfortably today and not have to worry about whether I have a large enough clientele to meet my overhead expenses. If I could write my own ticket I would love to be teaching ONLY those students who want to learn and are willing to practice. I have no plans of retiring… ever!

  Working as a Mechanic: No Degree, No Problem

 August 16, 2012 
   
 _This is a true story as told to DiversityJobs Street Smarts , where you can find career interviews for the job you’ve been looking for. Visit to find an interview in your desired field today. _ I am a mechanic at Walls Garage in Greenwood, Mississippi. I have been  working  there since 1982. I fix a variety of cars, motorcycles, and small motor vehicles. We handle all kinds of problems from basic preventative maintenance to massive automotive repair. The most common misunderstanding about what we do is that all mechanics have encyclopedic knowledge of every car ever made. In reality, we own manuals for different makes and models of cars that help us navigate tricky repairs. For something relatively routine, like an oil change, we do not need to use the manuals very often. For something more complicated, like re-installing airbags, we routinely get out the manuals to make sure we are doing the work according to manufacturer specifications. I would rate my job as an eight. As a kid I loved working on cars, and today I get to do it full-time. I wish I had more control over my work hours - especially not having to work on Saturdays - but I enjoy my job a lot. I immediately started working as a mechanic after graduation. Some people go to a vocational or technology school to learn about automotive repair once they graduate from high school, but I went straight into fixing cars because I already knew a lot about them. I knew the owner of the garage, so it wasn't a problem to get a  job  there after graduation. I gradually got more hours as I worked longer and proved my skills. If I could go back, I might have gotten a certification in diesel repair - working on big trucks earns more money than regular cars. One time I installed a transmission backwards on a foreign car and it completely destroyed the drive train. It was an expensive repair and required an extra two weeks to fix. I was pretty embarrassed that day. I once had someone offer to pay for repairs in cookies and pies! She was a very sweet older woman who lived on a fixed income. She needed a relatively minor repair, so we donated the labor for free. It really helped her out in a tight spot. I enjoy working with my hands and helping people keep their cars in excellent condition. I feel good when I solve difficult problems with cars, like finding something wrong that other mechanics had overlooked. Customers can be extremely demanding sometimes. We occasionally have people bring in cars for service then insist we broke something in the car during repairs. They are usually just trying to scare us into providing free service. My job is not very stressful. We take our time and try to do a good job on every repair. I maintain a healthy  work-life balance . I make about $63,000 per year. I think I am paid enough, and I feel so thankful to have that salary without a college degree. Be prepared to work few hours at a garage when you first start. My first few years of work were a steep learning curve, and only after I proved myself did I start getting better hours. I would like to buy the garage and run it myself. I haven't done it yet because the machinery and parts are so expensive, but I would love to own my own business.  Mechanic working image  from Stockvault

 This is a true story as told to   DiversityJobs Street Smarts   , where you can find career interviews for the job   you've been looking for   .   Visit   to find an interview in your desired field today.  I work at a  marketing  and public relations agency that specializes in the entertainment industry, namely with directors, musicians, and a few small production houses; my position is Junior Account Manager. As of 2012, I have three years of experience working in this field. Many people believe that working in the  entertainment industry  is a glamorous job that involves lots of travel and working with top celebrities, and although it's a fun job, it's not always as exciting as some people may think. I am usually in meetings with co-workers developing new marketing strategies, analyzing past and current marketing campaigns. A lot of my work involves researching and planning, especially as I just recently joined a new agency. The rest of the time is usually spent speaking to journalists, advertisers, clients, and vendors. I would say that only about five percent of my time is spent travelling or attending events. On a scale of one to ten, I would rate my job satisfaction at an eight. If I could change anything about my work, I would really love to be able to work on more accounts and attend more fun events! Luckily, after I’ve been working with this company for a little longer, this change will soon happen. I am proud to say that I love my job and I know without a doubt that this is my calling in life. I am one of the few lucky people who wake up excited to get to work. Not everyone can work in the entertainment industry or in marketing, but it is the perfect fit for my personality. One thing people need to consider is that I was fortunate enough to move to another country and start my work in a large, international city that has a great market and need for this field - something that someone who lives in a more rural area or cannot commute daily to a large city may not be able to achieve. I got started in this line of work by chance. I started off by looking for internships in marketing while I was in college. The first was for a musical theater production company. The next was for a movie production and distribution company. After that came two marketing and public relation agencies that had several musicians and directors as clients. I did not intend to find work experiences in the entertainment industry, but those are the ones that I kept finding. Eventually, one of the internships hired me back a couple of years later and my career took off from there. I would not change a thing about my experiences, though! One hard-learned lesson that I had while working is that proper organization and attention to detail can really make or break your plans. While working on a campaign, I accidentally sent out information to a few vendors with the wrong dates on them without realizing it - needless to say we ended up having those vendors missing on the day they were meant to show up for an event and almost had to cancel! The most important thing I learned about the working world since leaving school would have to be that motivation is everything. Since I went to school in another country, my student loans were pretty high and that was a real motivator for me to find work that paid well soon. When I first started working, I wasn’t paid enough to pay off my loans as fast as I would like, so it also motivated me to work even harder and get a promotion as soon as possible. The strangest thing to happen to me at work would have to be on one April’s Fools Day when a band that I worked for decided to play a prank on me. They pretended to be really angry with my work and quit! Maybe not so strange, but it was definitely not the funniest prank on my end! I think being able to see all my hard work really pay off (and have the public see my hard work pay off, too) really helps get me up in the morning. My most proud moment would have to be my very first big accomplishment which was a 40% increase in sales for one band’s clothing line in just a month. The next month it increased by another 30%. Knowing that I was able to help increase those sales by so much was such a great feeling. There are always challenges in this field. A lot of it has to deal with bad media coverage, low sales, or upset clients. I think anything that has to deal with the media really makes me want to pull my hair out because it’s usually the hardest to fix. My job is not always stressful, but there are times when I have to work very late every night for a month. Overall, it’s not so bad. At my current position and level, someone may be paid around $38,000 to $50,000, depending on the company, area, and type of clients. It's definitely enough for me to live comfortably. I don’t really take much vacation, not that I am not allowed to take it, I just like to stay in the office when I can. Even if I am on vacation, I do sometimes get calls and have to do a couple of things while at home. On average, I take at least a week vacation a year. I have a bachelor’s degree in marketing communications and a master’s degree in Internet marketing. I am also great with most computer programs and have taken both speech and public speaking classes. I feel that these skills and degrees really helped me to be successful in my  career . If a friend wanted to get a job in my field, I would recommend them to be prepared to do a lot of work, and remember that some of it may be boring at first. I would also tell them to remember to keep a sense of humor; I think it’s important to have a good sense of humor in most fields. If I could decide what I would be doing in five years, I would say that I would like to own my own business and have a lot of successful clients.
