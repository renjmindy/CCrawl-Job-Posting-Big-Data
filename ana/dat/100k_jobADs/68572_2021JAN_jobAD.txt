 Finding the perfect partner can be a daunting task…but it’s not unlike a process you might be very familiar with: job hunting. Much like a romantic relationship, job hunting starts with a first impression (like a first date) and is full of the same hurdles you’ll face in the dating world. How do you find the perfect company (or perfect partner)? What kind of company (or type of person) is best for you? 
 Considering how you look for a romantic partner may help point the way to finding the right employment match. And considering  how much time you may end up spending at work , finding the right fit makes it just as important. 
 There are lots of different ways to connect. So, what’s your style?  Click Here to Read Article …

 At this time of year my mailbox is filled with resumes from college seniors looking for their first real job and begin their career. The sad truth is that  all  of those resumes go directly into the garbage, for two reasons: This is not an efficient way for me to hire employees, and I believe people who simply send out unsolicited resumes are not really serious about their career. 
 It’s not that I’m a stickler for proper job-hunting protocol. In fact, over the years I’ve hired four people who simply showed up at my office without an appointment, requesting to tell me how and why they would make a good member of my team. These are the type of prospective employees whose resumes I do read.  Click Here to Read Article …

 It’s tough making the decision to quit your job, especially now with the unemployment so high. So, how do you know if you should stay or go? 
 Some people try to stick out a job they don’t love out of fear they’ll get labeled as a “job hopper” or have trouble finding the next gig (after all, most recruiters prefer to hire people who are already employed). Others find that leaving a stressful job frees them up emotionally and logistically to find the next job.  Click Here to Read Article …
