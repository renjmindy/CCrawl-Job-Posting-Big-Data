 I have a requirement for a number of technical project managers to join my client, a FTSE listed outsourcing business for one of their major central government clients.

You will work particularly closely with the Head of PMO to remain focused on delivery and output. 
 Previous experience of managing medium sized teams is essential as well as is having worked in an Agile delivery environment, A proven track record of managing technology relates projects is also necessary. You must have strong communication skills with the ability to influence at the most senior level. 
 I am looking for successful candidates to start almost immediately with interviews taking place next week. 
 I should stress that these roles will now be office based again albeit in a covid secure environment. Please don't hesitate to apply for the role and please make sure that you highlight your current security clearance in your application so it can be checked quickly and easily.
