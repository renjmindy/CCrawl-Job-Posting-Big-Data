 About Fam 
 Fam is the best way to socialize on your phone in a way that's most similar to interacting in real life. Weâ€™re a social network that helps you connect with friends and new people through live video chat. We believe that the way people socially interact on their phones is fundamentally broken, and causing widespread anxiety, insecurity, and loneliness - and we have the foundation to solve that for an entire generation. 
 We went from zero to 500,000+ users in just over 30 days with 50+ video calls per user per day being performed in the app. We're hiring a Founding Backend Engineer as we look to build more immersive live video experiences beyond the first 1,000,000 users. 
 Weâ€™re building a distributed team with hubs in New York City and Los Angeles. As founders, weâ€™ve led Product, Engineering, and Design teams at Instagram and Facebook. Weâ€™ve raised more than $3.5 million in funding from leading investors including Pear, Greylock, Y Combinator, and the early investors in Facebook.
