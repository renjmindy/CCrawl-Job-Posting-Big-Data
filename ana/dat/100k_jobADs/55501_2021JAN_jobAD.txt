- Influence architectural decisions and build a performant execution engine which will bring this platform into the future 
- Be part of a highly motivated team of software engineers with a strong team culture. 
- Think about bigger picture, take calculated risks and come up with innovative ideas 
 You 'll need to have: 
- Advanced Java coding skills (5+ years) with focus on Low Latency computing 
- 5+ years experience with Design Patterns, Concurrent Programming 
- 5+ years experience with IOC frameworks like Spring. 
- Experience with Tuning high performance applications.

- Experience working in fast paced Continuous Delivery projects 
 We 'd love to see: 
- Experience with Scala, Apache Spark and Apache Arrow
