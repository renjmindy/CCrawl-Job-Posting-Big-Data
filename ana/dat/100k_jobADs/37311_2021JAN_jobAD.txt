 I am currently working with an industry leading professional services business who are currently looking for a Financial Manager based in their Stourbridge office to head up the Management Accounts team and be responsible for reporting into the company FC. 
 With a strong customer base, you will be responsible for internal and external stakeholder management, along with monitoring efficiency and reconciling and monitoring processes and contracts within the division, alongside reporting to the wider group. 
 The company is looking for a team player to be the lynch pin in communications with group FC. 
 The position will be heavily focused on Management Accounts and systems integration with other divisions of the group. 
 The successful candidate will need strong management accounts background along with solid relationship building skills and ideally have experience in leading a team. 
 This position will be focused around both the day-to-day financial operations, but also much larger company projects. You will ideally be ACCA, ACA or CIMA qualified and have the gravitas to implement change and nurture and develop relationships internally as well as externally. 
 For the successful Assistant Financial Controller, they are looking to pay between £50,000 to £60,000 DOE. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
