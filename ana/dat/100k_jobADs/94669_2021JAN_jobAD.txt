 Careers in Coffee 
 Sourcing, roasting and brewing the best coffee possible requires great people at every level. 
 We're always excited to hear from motivated individuals who want to offer their very best in every facet of our growing team, so that we can continue to grow a passionate team. 
 We wholeheartedly believe in offering careers in coffee, providing opportunities to develop, grow and progress throughout the business. To-date, we've seen Bar Backs move through the ranks to become Roastery Managers, Operational Leads, Roasters and Training Managers. 
 If you have... 
 
 a keen eye for detail 
 a warm and approachable demeanour 
 a desire to learn and develop 
 enthusiasm and initiative 
 fastidious punctuality and presentation 
 
 ...then you should be getting in touch. 
 To see which roles we're currently hiring for, head to the bottom of this page or send us an  e-mail. 
 Our Barista Roadmap 
 Taking the first step of your career in coffee with us requires the right work ethic and a desire to learn; you don't need reams of experience to work in coffee to work with us. 
 That's why we established our Barista Roadmap training program. Designed specifically to show you the ropes, the Roadmap covers everything from coffee theory to pulling perfect shots, our approach to sourcing and roasting and, most importantly, how to create a warm and welcoming environment for our guests. 
 With patience and determination, the aim is that by the end of your first year with us you'll be behind one of our espresso machines making and serving delicious drinks to our customers, continuing on towards the next step in your career.
