 Home Welcome to Mary's Blog 
 Welcome to Mary's Blog 
 WELCOME  to my blog where i talk about items, topics, events, trends and occurrences that piques my interest. 
 Yes right, i blog what's on my mind, 'my thoughts; just the way it is'. Hold up a minute, this is year 2019, i do have a niche. 
 It lies somewhere between Teaching How To Do Tech | Managing Tech Communities & Techies | A little Blogging | and Public Speaking. 
 I currently work as a Product Manager @  How Do You Tech , an edu-tech research firm documenting useful and correct answers to questions in tech. 
 ABOUT ME 
 
 MojiSpeaks is written by yours truly, Mojisola Mary Job,  winks 
 
 On my blog you will find random musings and information on whatever pops up in Mary's head, otherwise explicitly stated. 
 Call me MJ, i love my creator and i love myself, i love simplicity, i am very easy going and fun to be with when extroverted, i can be an introvert or extrovert, all depends on how i feel at each moment. 
 I love to meet new and exciting people, networking, exchanging ideas and learning new things and cultures. I love mysteries, my interests lie in going deep into information society technologies and Law. Yes, you read me right, studying Law is still on my to-do list. I use social media purposefully and i enjoy exploring tech gadgets. 
 
 I love traveling and adventures!  I am always a digital nomad at heart and soul! 
 
 I enjoy experiencing new places and i definitely love taking photos. I like to take pictures of people, food, myself and any sight that piques my interest. 
 So who doesn't love a good healthy meal ehn? The irony, i am not a fan of cooking, but i love great tasting meals. Want to win me over? Offer me some great tasting chocolate cheese cake, preferable from  Caff√® Tranche By Araba  or a trip to any  Java House of Africa , or the  Mediterraneo Restaurant.  These people have the best meals and dessert. And it's not just about the tasty meal, its' the presentation of the meal that makes me drool. 
 Jajajajaja‚Ä¶sighs oh yeah, where was i? OK. So i also got a mission to travel around the world!! And i love the saying "All izz well" from the movie - 3 idiots! Don't tell me you haven't seen that movieüßê?? 
 
 If you have anything you want to say about my blog, feel free to leave a comment, or  click here to contact me   or send an email to  mary@howdoyou.tech , i would be ecstatic to read from you. 
 
 Lastly, If you like my blog and you enjoy reading my posts, or enjoyed reading any one particular post, please follow my blog, and make use of the social media 'share buttons' to share with your friends too, after-all knowledge sharing is power!! And sharing is Caring too!! 
 You can also inspire me to write more by buying me a cup of coffee  grinning  Xoxo!! Who again does not like coffee? Teasing üòö 
 Thank you, enjoy reading and have  a Happy Reflection!!

We are hoping to do that. we traveled across Italy and Sicily and did some workaways but found a lot of workaways treated you like slaves and others like family. Having said all that, we have bitten by the bug and aim to start travelling in Feb 17 with online work xx

I bookmarked your tips page, am going to print it out and explore, check listing. The emphasis all boils down to networking, we cannot underestimate the necessity of networking in today's age. Would love to sit in your class and pretend to be a 7th grader so I can learn from you. Am from Nigeria and I reside here. Been to Ghana, Togo, and I look forward to exploring more. Cheerios.

Please forgive my ignorance! üòâ ‚ù§

Sherrie Miranda's historically based, coming of age, Adventure novel ‚ÄúSecrets & Lies in El Salvador‚Äù is about an American girl in war-torn El Salvador:

 Hi Sherrie, oh no but you are not being ignorant. Don't you know no one person knows it all. Ijebu is the name of a town and tribe of people from Ogun State, in Nigeria. I believe you know Nigeria is a country in the western part of Africa, and Africa is a continent with about 57 Different Countries. (Not so sure, but I know it's between 50 and 59). Since straight outta Compton says I am from Compton in the US. Hence Straight outta Ijebu says I am from Ijebu in Nigeria. Do you get?
