 Job brief 
 We are looking for a Veterinary Assistant to care for animals and support Veterinarians. You’ll play an important role in bringing comfort to our furry patients and ensuring the smooth running of our facility. 
 What does a Veterinary Assistant do? 
 One of the most important Veterinary Assistant responsibilities is to ensure all areas are clean, for animals and humans alike. We’ll also rely on you to assist the Veterinarian in examinations and operations. 
 Veterinary Assistant skills 
 Do you love animals? Then you’re halfway there. You also need the ability to care for them properly – that’s one of the most important Vet Assistant job requirements. This includes knowledge of routine tasks, like feeding or bathing animals, but also readiness to care for injured or scared animals that might occasionally lash out. 
 If you’re also organized, quick on your feet and have the stomach to help with medical operations and euthanasia, we’d like to meet you.

 Restrain animals during examinations or vaccinations 
 Soothe upset or frightened animals 
 Administer medication prescribed by Veterinarians (e.g. by mixing it with food) 
 Observe animal behavior or health condition and report to the Vet 
 Help in cases of emergencies 
 Handle administrative duties such as scheduling appointments or calling patients in the examination room by priority 
 Keep accurate records and logs 
 Reassure clients that their pets are being cared for and explain issues (e.g. lack of appointments, insurance matters) 
 Advise pet owners on nutrition and healthcare 
 
 Requirements 
 
 Proven experience as a Veterinary Assistant or similar position working with animals 
 Experience in an administrative role is a plus 
 Current or former pet ownership is an advantage 
 Excellent communication skills 
 Patient and caring personality 
 Ability to follow instructions properly 
 Comfortable being around animals (cats, dogs, birds, reptiles etc.)
