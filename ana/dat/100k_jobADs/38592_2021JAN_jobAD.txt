 UACCM’s 7th Annual Job Fair was a Success 
 The University of Arkansas Community College at Morrilton’s Adult Education Center in Conway hosted its 7th annual Job Fair & Career Expo on May 16, 2018. The event attracted over 28 employers, colleges, and local organizations that conducted on-site interviews, accepted resumes, and distributed resourceful information to over 90 attendees. 
 The event provided attendees with the opportunity to meet with agencies about available services, speak with employers, and allowed them to take steps toward gaining employment, and for some, even being hired. 
 Many attendees who visited the Central Arkansas Workforce Development Area booth learned about the programs and services available through the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), which lead to several referrals. 
 Overall, the event was a success and provided opportunities to make networking contacts with the local companies, agencies, and potential participants.
