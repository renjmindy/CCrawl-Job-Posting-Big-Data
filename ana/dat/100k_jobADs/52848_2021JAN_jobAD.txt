  What Is A 30-60-90-Day Plan & Why Do You Need One For Your Job Interview?  
 Peggy McKee 
 November 01, 2016 
 Have you ever heard of 30-60-90-day plans for job interviews? These are probably the least well-known but most effective interview tools that anyone can use to dramatically boost their chances of getting the job.  Related: How To Write A 30-60-90-Day Plan That Gets You The Job Offer 
 
 What is a 30-60-90-day plan? 
 A  30 60 90 day plan  lists out the tasks, goals, and/or action steps you will complete in a timeline of your first three months on the job. You not only specify what you will do but when you will do it. The idea is to run through your plans and ideas with the employer in the interview and have a higher-level discussion about how you will approach the job and be more successful at it. 
 What kinds of things are included in a 30-60-90-day plan? 
 All jobs have things that must be accomplished in order to say that you are being successful, doing a good job, and so on. Typically, the first 30 days are devoted to completing any company training, getting to know everyone, and familiarizing yourself with the specific systems and procedures of that company. The next 30 days usually involve getting feedback, deepening your knowledge and stepping further out on your own in your role. The last 30 days are a good time to begin your solidify your place, begin making changes and/or updates, and start new projects on your own. Some jobs may move a little faster or a little slower, and of course the specific details differ depending on the job. 
 Why do you need a 90-day plan for your job interview? 
 When you go over your thoughts about how you would approach the job, the interviewer immediately knows that you are (a) a dedicated hard worker; and (b) someone who knows what they’re doing. You won’t have everything in your plan exactly right (how could you if you haven’t done the job?) but the process of going through it and asking questions gives you tons of information and a much more significant, higher-level conversation than the other candidates are probably having. That same process helps the hiring manager (the interviewer) visualize you in the job. They can ‘see’ you being successful, which makes them much more likely to hire you. Not only does bringing a plan boost your chances of getting the job, it gives you a solid foundation once you start for what to do next. With your plan, you know that you and your new boss are on the same page. You can start your job with confidence, knowing you’re doing the right things. 
 If you want more information…
