 Okay 
 Sweet Baby Jason! it's a Full-time job 
 Criquet is looking for a Copywriter in Austin, TX, USA. 
 About 
 Criquet is an independent web-driven menswear brand from Austin, TX. We invest in quality of life. We’re as well stocked in IPAs as we are IRAs. We’re into counter-culture, dive bars and scuba-diving for lost golf balls. We’re all manner of men and women but we aren’t yes-men. Because ordinary is boring. So, whether we’re making shirts, outerwear or old-fashioneds, they need to be high quality, they need to be done our way, and they need those little details that make all the difference. Proudly from Austin and comfortably off-course. 
 We're looking for a talented, funny and clever copywriter to help conceptualize and communicate our brand voice (see above for example) across all channels. 
 Responsibilities include: 
 Help bring the Criquet voice (with guidance from our brand book) to life across all customer touch-points and marketing campaigns: 
 Website, Blog, Emails, Organic Social, Paid Social, Landing Pages, Look Books & Any New Marketing Channels (exploring direct mail, TV and native). 
 Conceptualize and develop short form content that can used in all channels with a particular focus on social media, paid and organic. 
 Help conceptualize photoshoots - ie the creative part of them - how do we inject more storytelling into these shoots? 
 With the help of our dev team, work on improving SEO rankings for certain keywords. 
 Making people laugh. 
 Being a team player.
