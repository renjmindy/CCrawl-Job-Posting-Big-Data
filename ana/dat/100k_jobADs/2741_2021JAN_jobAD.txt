Most Dangerous Jobs in America 
 Workplace fatalities have fallen since 1970, but some workers still face big risks. 
 Most Dangerous Jobs in America 
 In 1970, the United States had 14,000 on-the-job fatalities. Because of that, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) was created. The agency helped reduce fatalities -- there were just 5,250 on-the-job deaths in 2018 -- and keeps detailed statistics about accidents, fatal or otherwise, that happen when people are at work. 
 If your occupation isn't on this list, you have a pretty good chance of surviving the workday. OSHA says 3.5 out of every 100,000 people die on the job each year. Those are about the same odds you have of being murdered by a firearm or, if you're a woman, of dying from cervical cancer. 
 If you work in any of the jobs on this list, however, you're taking a risk. The death rates in these jobs are at least twice as high (and as much as 20 times higher) than the average death rate for all jobs. And that's not even counting their high rate of nonfatal workplace injuries. 
 These jobs are proof that, as effective as OSHA has been in reducing workplace fatalities, some jobs are just downright dangerous. 
 Note: All data is from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Rankings are based on the number of deaths in 2018 per 100,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) workers, or fatal injury rate.

 Bottom Line: Operating Engineers and Other Construction Equipment Operators 
 There's a reason warning signs say do not operate heavy machinery unless you have read and understood the user manual and been well trained. 
 The primary cause of death in this profession is flying objects and contact with heavy machinery. These engineers and equipment operators use power equipment like bulldozers, pumps, derricks and the like, often to excavate, grade earth and pour concrete. 
 It's a rough job, and sometimes deadly.

 Bottom Line: Construction Supervisors 
 Being the person in charge doesn't make this job any safer. In fact, it makes it more dangerous, with a death rate of 21 per 100,000 people. Construction laborers, by comparison, had a death rate of 15.1 per 100,000. 
 These workers often do road work, meaning many of the fatal and non-fatal injuries involve a worker getting hit by a passing car. 
 There were also 5,390 nonfatal injuries in this field in 2018. 
 8. Structural Steel and Ironworkers 
 Fatal injuries per 100,000 FTE workers  : 23.6

 Bottom Line: Structural Steel and Iron Workers 
 The men and women who work to fasten steel to buildings that are under construction can often be just a slip away from a fatal workplace injury. 
 Most injuries and deaths on this job occur due to slips and falls, which isn't surprising. These workers have to work at great heights while performing hard manual labor. For every 100,000 FTE workers, 23.6 die on the job. 
 On the bright side, nonfatal injuries are significantly down. In 2016, there were 1,400 injuries compared to 800 in 2018. 
 7. Driver/Sales Workers and Truck Drivers

 Median annual salary  : $71,160 
 Bottom Line: Farmers and Ranchers 
 Transportation incidents made up the majority of fatal injuries for farmers. 
 Transportation incident means an accident with any vehicle designed for moving goods, like forklifts and wheelbarrows. There's a lot of that kind of equipment on a farm. 
 Farmers and ranchers do fare better when it comes to nonfatal injuries than some other dangerous jobs. Common workplace injuries in this field are slips and falls and musculoskeletal injuries. 
 5. Trash Collectors 
 Fatal injuries per 100,000 FTE workers   :  44.3 
 Number of jobs  : 121,330 
 Total fatal injuries  : 61

 Bottom Line: Roofers 
 As of 2018, 106 roofers died on the job, and another 2,060 were injured. Not surprisingly, the most common causes of injuries were slips and falls, but roofers also are exposed to hot weather, and their jobs involve lots of bending and heavy lifting. 
 And when roofers get hurt, their injuries are serious. They have an average recovery time of 20 days off the job after an accident, which is significantly longer than most other professions, according to the BLS. 
 Also according to the BLS, roofing jobs are growing, with a 10-year job outlook rate of 12 percent, much faster than average, with an expected 19,000 jobs added to the industry by 2028. 
 3. Pilots and Flight Engineers 
 Fatal injuries per 100,000 FTE workers  : 58.9 
 Number of jobs  : 82,890 
 Total fatal injuries  : 70 
 Most common fatal accidents  : Transportation incidents 
 Total nonfatal injuries  : 490 
 Median annual salary  : $165,560 
 Bottom Line: Pilots and Flight Engineers 
 Overnight layovers and constantly shifting work schedules make pilots prone to exhaustion. 
 The leading cause of injuries among this profession is general soreness and pain. The most common cause of fatalities in this profession is plane crashes, as you might imagine. 
 The death rate for aviation professionals in 2018 was 58.9 per 100,000 FTE workers, an increase of about 2 percent since 2016. 
 
 
 
 2. Fishers and Fishing Workers 
 Fatal injuries per 100,000 FTE workers  : 77.4 
 Number of jobs  : 520 
 Total fatal injuries  : 33 
 Most common fatal accidents  : Transportation incidents 
 Total non-fatal injuries  : 710 
 Median annual salary  : $31,190 
 Bottom Line: Fishing 
 There's a lot that can go wrong when you're fishing off the coast while working with heavy machinery and navigating slippery surfaces. There were 33 fishing fatalities in 2018, enough for a rate of 77.4 per 100,000 FTE workers. 
 Fishers are exposed to harsh weather conditions, and because trips can last days or weeks, they don't necessarily have the choice of calling off the workday when the weather is bad. 
 While fishing carries a risk almost as great as logging, the salary is even worse: Fishermen made an average annual salary of $31,190. 
 1. Logging Workers 
 Fatal injuries per 100,000 FTE workers  : 97.6 
 Number of jobs  : 53,600 
 Total fatal injuries  : 75 
 Most common fatal accidents  : Contact with objects and equipment 
 Total non-fatal injuries  : 1,040 
 Median annual salary  : $41,230 
 Bottom Line: Logging Workers 
 The line from Monty Python's " The Lumberjack Song "-- "I'm a lumberjack and I'm OK" -- doesn't always apply to loggers. 
 The most common injury, fatal or otherwise, is being hit by a falling object. Loggers often work outdoors and in remote areas, far from emergency medical care. Plus, they're working with dangerous equipment, like chainsaws and wood chippers. Forty-nine deaths occur due to contact with machinery and other objects. 
 In addition to the 75 fatalities OSHA recorded among loggers in 2018, there were 1,040 nonfatal injuries. To top it off, loggers are relatively low-paid when you consider the risk.
