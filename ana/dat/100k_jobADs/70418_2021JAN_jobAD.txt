 How the right mindset and attitude can lead to a permanent role at Rio Tinto 
 BY: Tracey Mesken26/11/2018 
 ​WorkPac would like to congratulate Marley, one of several WorkPac employees at the Mesa A site who have gone permanent with Rio!​In late 2017 WorkPac and JobTrail underwent a recruitment drive in the Pilbara region focused on offering young Indigenous job seekers who were interested in mining a pathway into the industry. Marley was part of a Robe Valley assessment centre run by the JobTrail team where he was a standout candidate and landed a role as a trainee operator on site at Mesa A.Throughout his entire traineeship Marley’s work performance has been of the highest level and he has been a great team player. Our Site Manager for Mesa A, Kath Collins, caught up with Marley’s Supervisor Dean to learn more about what earned him a permanent position.“Marley is a positive young guy. He is a very productive worker and is always the first to put his hand up for other jobs when the trucks are down. He is a real go getter of a young bloke, and that is why we progressed him. Everyone in the team speaks highly of him. I am confident that Marley will be a great asset to our team and will go a long way with Rio Tinto” he said.When asked what advice he would give to other young people looking for a career in mining, Marley emphasised the importance of keeping a good attitude on site.“Definitely, the number one thing is to have a good attitude. Don’t let the information overload get to you or overwhelm you at first- because there is so much to learn! … There is a lot of adjusting to do at first, but ease into it and be willing to keep an open mind about it all. Be willing and eager to learn, be flexible, and give everything a go!”Kath also spoke with Marley about the best parts of the job, who spoke highly about the Mesa A site and crew.“I would have to say the People, I work with a great bunch of people who make it enjoyable to come to work and catch up. Mesa A is a great Site. The crews are pretty small, so you get to know everyone really well, and feel part of a close team. I felt part of the team from the moment I got out here. Finally, it is a great learning environment, there is always something new learn, and Mesa A and the managers are really encouraging of that”Marley is a fantastic example of how the right attitude and mindset can lead to great things, and a great role model for all those looking to crack into the industry. We would like to wish him the best of luck as he continues his mining career with Rio Tinto- we’re sure he’s going to go far!

 8 Ways to Build Relationships at Work 
 BY: Tracey Mesken10/04/2017 
 ​When considering how much of the working week is spent with colleagues, it’s no surprise that one of the biggest causes of work-related stress is poor relationships.Taking steps to actively build rapport with work colleagues helps contribute to a harmonious work environment.Just like your personal relationships, nurturing healthy connections at work requires some consideration and effort. Here are eight everyday actions that can help.1. Be considerate of work spacesObserve how your colleagues work and be mindful, particularly when you have to share a space. You may enjoy background music but others may like to work in silence. Or perhaps reconsider your loud ring tone if you see the person sitting near you start to twitch every time you get a call.2. Always respondAcknowledge calls or emails from colleagues as much as you can, even if you are too busy to properly respond at the time. It doesn’t take much effort and is the polite thing to do. Talking face to face always helps strengthen a connection, so occasionally take the opportunity get away from behind your emails and respond directly or over the phone.3. Respect other people's timeEveryone is trying to juggle multiple priorities, so when asking for help with something, don’t blind side a colleague with unrealistic demands or timeframes. A genuine “thank you” is always appreciated so be sure to say it when due.4. Avoid the blame gameIf a project runs into a problem or a deadline isn’t met, resist the urge to blame someone outright. Passing the buck or singling someone out will alienate colleagues and won’t make you seem like a team player.5. Keep to your commitmentsQuite simply, if you say you’re going to do something, do it when you say you will. Set and deliver on expectations and communicate openly and in a timely manner if there are going to be delays. Don’t make people chase you for updates or results.6. Celebrate the success of your coworkersHow good do you feel when someone acknowledges your work or achievements? Do the same for your colleagues, no matter how big or small.7. Don’t let emotions get in the wayWhen you aren’t getting the results you need from a colleague, think before banging out a huffy email, CCing (or worse BCCing) in their manager and half the company along with them. A public email beating is a sure fire way to permanently damage relationships fast so be direct but courteous and keep emotions at bay. Use phone or face to face meetings for robust conversations to ensure nothing is lost in translation over email.8. Have a laughIt is easier to work with and navigate through issues with someone you can share a laugh and relax with. When your workload allows it, go to lunch with colleagues or take five minutes in your day to have an informal chat and connect over non-work related things.The saying “treat others the way you want to be treated” couldn’t ring more true in a workplace. By simply being respectful and having a positive attitude towards your colleagues, you can strengthen your relationships and contribute to a supportive work environment.

 Reasons your resume isn't getting noticed 
 BY: Tracey Mesken03/04/2017 
 ​You submit your resume and wait. And wait. And wait. Why isn’t anyone calling?A resume is an important tool in your job search. It is the key to helping you get hired for a position.Your resume is a chance to make a great first impression. It can be tough to stand out in today’s competitive job market. Follow these tips to create a resume that gets the phone ringing and helps you land the job you want.1. Open with a punchThe first section of your resume should pack the strongest punch. Your resume needs to be more than just a list of jobs. Start with a summary of your most important skills that are relevant to the jobs you are chasing. Think about what the employer would be looking for and then tailor your existing skills and qualifications accordingly. Include things like:• Your degree/s and any specialisations• Licenses’, tickets & certifications like your CPR• Medicals & Inductions• Years of experience• Important skills & industry knowledge2. Your Work HistoryYour work history is where you have a chance to prove your skill level. You might find it difficult to identify your achievements because you feel you were just doing your job. Have a think about the responsibilities and achievements you take for granted and include these in your resume. Ask yourself questions like:• Did you win any awards of receive incentives for work performance?• Did you train new employees?• Did your work enable a project to be completed on time and/or on budget?• Did you complete any special training?• Did you submit all your reports on time?• Did you implement or recommend processes that improved productivity or efficiency?3. TrainingA stand out resume needs to include hands on education and training. Use this section to list courses attended, vocational training, further education, certification, licenses completed, signed skills matrix & equipment competencies.4. Include KeywordsEver wondered how prospective employers or recruiters find your resume on platforms like SEEK or in their own databases? They search for candidates using keywords. Using keywords such as "registered nurse"or "nurse case manager" in your resume, for example, will help an employer or recruiter find your resume in their database or on a job board - as long as they're searching for candidates who are either a registered nurse or nurse case manager. This is keyword matching. Always think about what your next employer is searching for when writing your resume.5. Proof ReadSpelling and grammatical errors are very common in resumes. Avoiding these mistakes can make all the difference in your resume being put forward to possible employers. Make sure you show your resume to a few people to double check it is error free. You need to think of your resume as an advertisement of your services, that extra attention to detail will make all the difference.Don’t be disheartened and don’t give up! There are so many roles out there and so many people applying that you are not likely to find the perfect job on your first go.So use the tips above, create that stand-out resume and make sure you set time aside each day to sit down and search for new positions and apply, apply, apply!

 BY: Tracey Mesken26/02/2016 
 ​Job Trail, Indigenous workforce specialist and member of the WorkPac Group, is joining forces with Traditional Owners, Indigenous and local businesses and State Government departments to launch the Let’s Walk Together career preparation program for Indigenous school leavers.An information session on the Let’s Walk Together program, held in South Mackay last Thursday, encouraged school leavers to sign-up for the program before its official launch in March.Bowen Basin Services and JobTrail will lead the Let’s Walk Together program, providing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander school-leavers with educational training and cultural support to help identify and map their preferred career pathway. Julian Genn, JobTrail Regional Manager, says the program will grow a talented Indigenous workforce in the Mackay region.“Ultimately we aim to improve Indigenous life outcomes and we are optimistic about a fairer, more inclusive future with proper recognition of the past. This lasting change starts at a local level with education and employment,” Mr Genn said.“Let’s Walk Together is designed to address educational needs in a holistic way, incorporating cultural considerations”.“The Traditional Owners will be involved in the project and genuine partnerships we’ve formed in the region will drive community engagement, enabling us to deliver program outcomes aligned with Indigenous employment targets”.Melisha Johnson was enthusiastic about joining the program and signed up at the information session on Thursday.“The program is an excellent way to help year 13 Indigenous students like myself to get back into study or into the workforce,” Ms Johnson said.“We will be working in close links with JobTrail and Bowen Basin Services, which I think will help us get an understanding of how each organisation can help”.“Let’s Walk Together helps get year 13 kids up and out of bed and into some sort of study or work. I’m sure after the program everyone who participated will appreciate the hard work of each and every person who has made the program possible for us”.Alkira Compass, a 100% owned and operated Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander business, is contributing key strategies and processes throughout the journey.Mareshah Bowie, Alkira Compass representative, says Let’s Walk Together is about empowering Indigenous school-leavers to understand their connections to identity and community so they can take hold of their own future.“This program offers Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander school-leavers the opportunity to make better-informed decisions about their future pathways with the support of their cultural community connections,” Ms Bowie said.Representatives from the Queensland Government’s Department of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships (DATSIP) and the Department of Education and Training (DET) strongly endorsed the program.Peter Buckland, Director for the DATSIP Mackay Service Centre spoke about empowering a capable and productive Indigenous workforce with enhanced accountability and offered ongoing support and mentorship to the program participants.'Bruce Williams, Professional Facilitator at Aus IDentities, will work with the students to build self-directed strategies around workplace resilience, communication and self-worth while overcoming negative thinking patterns and focusing on identity construction.Gold Training will also provide training resources to encourage participants to enter an industry of their choice.Schools Pathways Manager at Gold Training, Celeste Grice focused on the importance of learning and will facilitate nationally recognised training relevant to the career goals of each school leaver.If you would like more information on the Let’s Walk Together program or would like to get involved, please contact:Abi Ah Wong, Program Coordinator, Bowen Basin ServicesAahWong@ViaTraining.com.au 07 4951 3462Julian Genn, Regional Manager, JobTrailJulian.Genn@jobtrailatsi.com.au 07 32512276
