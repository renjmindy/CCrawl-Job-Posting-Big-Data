 Look At This! it's a Full-time job 
 Shaper is looking for an UX/UI Designer in San Francisco, CA, USA. 
 About 
 Founded in 2012 and based in San Francisco, Shaper is developing a revolutionary line of computer-augmented power tools, starting with a handheld CNC router called Origin. We’re looking for a talented UI/UX Designer to help us create a new web-based app that supports Origin and extends Shaper’s eco-system of products. 
 About this role: 
This is an opportunity to work on a new product initiative with a focus on mobile first UI/UX. You will work cross-functionally with Product Management and Engineering to solve complex and nuanced problems with simple solutions. You’ll help us concept and build new features which are designed to integrate with, compliment, and support those which run natively on Origin. You’ll work with the team to solve challenges that new Origin owners face and set them up for long term success via a new companion product. 
 Where you’ll work: 
You’ll join our team in our new workspace in San Francisco's SoMa district. You’ll have access to our 5000 square foot workshop which is fully kitted out with all the woodworking machinery you could ever wish for (including Origin).
