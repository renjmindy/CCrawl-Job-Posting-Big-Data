 Career Advice from an Inspirational Journalist 
 
 Great Career advice - for any career 
 Hiya, 
 My wife pointed me to this excellent article on becoming a freelance journalist by George Monbiot. The clue is in the word '  free  '. But even if you're not trying to be a writer the words here will inspire and provoke thought with regards to your own hopes and dreams. 
 If you're still under 30 you may still have hopes and dreams, if you're over 40 you may be wondering where they went. Read the article and it might just remind you…

 Getting To Grips With Fear And Confusion 
 Hiya, 
 This is an excerpt from my book: "Do You Hate Your Job?" - I re-read it today because I am feeling some of these feelings at the moment and this helped. To get a free pdf copy of my book see instructions at the bottom… 
 "  If you do decide to find a new job, new career or start up your own business know that there may well be fear and confusion along the way. 
 Learn to accept that, learn to understand that growing as a person is happening alongside this journey of following your passion, dream or goal. Sometimes you have to take the hit. If you want to go into events planning but don’t have the experience, why not get a job just helping other planners set their events up and learn how they do it from the ground up. 
 If you feel totally stuck or paralysed by fear or doubt - get calm. Sit still, breathe deeply and slowly and reconnect with your intuition, excitement, creativity and imagination. Trust yourself. 
 Accept that you won’t know all the answers, accept that you will have to take risks and above all accept that you may fail along the way. This is part of the journey. If it was easy everyone would do it - but they don’t. This is the road less travelled, this is the path to success, the difficult path but the one that leads to more fulfillment, contentedness, happiness, joy and ultimately life. 
 I did it, in fact I’m still doing it. Yes, I still have doubts and fears and I still find myself procrastinating from time to time. But at least now I’m aware of what’s going on and how to change it. 
 And remember to give yourself a break. It’s normal to be afraid, it’s normal to be unsure. Rather than chastise yourself for these negative feel- ings, acknowledge them. Sit with them for a while. Listen to what they’re trying to tell you. Then question if you agree with them or not. 
 Feelings are natural - accept them, allow them. If you want to know the strategies and tactics to change them… read on. " 
 To read the whole book simply email me at: stuart.young40@googlemail.com with "Send me the book" in the subject line and I'll send it to you direct, no strings, no endless emails trying to sell you something. Promise! 
 Enjoy 
 Stu

 7 Tips I Learned from 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad' 
 
 Rich Dad, Poor Dad 
 Hiya, 
 I finally got around to reading the famous Robert Kiyosaki book: "  Rich Dad, Poor Dad  ". 
 As a way of helping me remember books I'm going to start blogging my top tips from each starting with this book. So here are the 7 principles that stand out for me from this book… 
 #1 Pay yourself first 
 At first read this seems a little selfish but what Kiyosaki is talking about is paying yourself first before your mortgage, your bills, your debts etc. BECAUSE… that will give you the mindset to think more creatively about money so that you CAN pay everyone else. He doesn't advocate not paying people - just make sure it's YOU first. 
 #2 Get your money back quick 
 When investing in an asset Kiyosaki advises looking to get your initial investment back as soon as possible so the only amount left at risk was any equity or growth that asset achieved in the meantime. That way what's left IN the deal is actually free money. 
 #3 Let assets buy luxuries 
 Pay for the luxuries in your life out of money earned passively by your assets. EG: Let the rental income from any property you own (for example) pay for your holiday or car payments. You should never buy luxuries with earned money, because any excess '  earned  ' money should be put into buying assets that create positive cashflow. 
 #4 Model your heroes 
 Identify who your heroes are and why. Then learn as much as you can about them and what they did to become the people you admire so much. Copy their process if you want to be like them, there's no need to reinvent the wheel. 
 #5 Give away what you want most 
 Sounds counter-intuitive right? What Kiyosaki means is: identify what it is you want the most and learn to '  give  ' that to others. What you want then finds it's way back to you. You want more people to smile at you - smile at more people. In order to start a fire you must first give away a flame. 
 #6 Learn to teach 
 And he doesn't mean study  how to  teach, he means continue to learn all your life and then share (teach) what you learn with others. Only by teaching something do we get the deepest understanding of it. 
 #7 Don 't work for money 
 Most people work for money but if you want to be truly wealthy get money to work for you. Unfortunately the education system doesn't teach that, so you have to find your own teachers and learn from them. The good thing is… they're everywhere, in plain site. 
 That's my top 7 take aways from "  Rich Dad, Poor Dad  " - no substitute for reading the book yourself which I urge you to no matter where you are in your life. It's never too late to become wealthy. 
 Hope that helped - share with others if you think it did and keep an eye out for further book summaries. 
 Enjoy 
 Stu

 Take the opportunity today to thank everybody from your past because of where you are today and where you will be tomorrow. 
 
 Every season has it's time 
 Hiya, 
 You do realise that everything that has ever happened to you, good or bad, has brought you to where you are today. 
 You may be in a great place right now, so think if any tiny little thing in your past were different it would have changed your trajectory and you may well be in a very different place right now rather than where you are. 
 All those not so good places were necessary in order for you to be  here . 
 If you’re not in such a great place just realise that you are in one of those  not so good places  that will lead you to the great place later. So appreciate it for what it is. 
 Why only appreciate it later? Thank everything and everybody from your past for helping to get you here. Thank ‘  here  ’ for being part of the journey that’s going to get you ‘  there  ’ in the future. 
 And always remember… in the depths of winter the blossom is waiting to bloom. 
 Who will you thank, and for what? 
 Enjoy 
 Stu

 Can you see things for what they really are? 
 Hiya, 
 You know what I mean right? Sure you do. I could sit here and write a page of words that show you what they might be but I’d only be scratching the surface wouldn’t I? 
 We’ve all got stuff going on that we  say  is this or that. But we know it’s not. I mean it could look that way to the untrained eye, to the casual observer, but  we know  it’s just a façade for what’s really going on. 
 Take a good look at it today, be as honest with yourself as you can. Allow the discomfort or maybe even pain of looking at it to come through. Welcome it. Once we open the cupboard door and shine a light in there we can see there was nothing to be afraid of. 
 I know this’ll be hard for a lot of people - me included, so lets all dig deep and give it a try. 
 What will you take a look at today? 
 Enjoy (if you can) 
 Stu

 Have You Got Less Working Years Ahead Or Behind You? 
 
 Fed up being stuck in traffic going to work? 
 Hiya, 
 Have You Got Less Working Years Ahead Or Behind You? 
 I read a blog post by Stephen Edwards recently and this line in it inspired the question above: “  The truth is I have probably lived more days than I’m going to live.  “ 
 Wow! That focuses the mind, right? 
 We’ve all heard of Peak Oil – it’s the point when we have burned more oil than is left in the ground, we’ve gone past the halfway mark – there’s less left than what we’ve used. Trouble is, we’re using it faster every day so it won’t last as long as we’ve been using it already. 
 This is much like life – it goes faster the more we live it. The older we get the quicker it goes! The big question is – what are you going to do with what’s left? 
 Nobody knows how much time they have, so let’s make each and every day a step towards who we really are and who we really want to be. Let’s show the world our unique selves, let’s offer the gift of ourselves to  everyone . 
 If you’re a man of 38 or more, you’re probably halfway through your life - shocking right? The same if you’re a woman of 40 or more. I don’t say that to depress you but rather to spur you on to consider what you want the rest of your life to be like - work or otherwise. 
 And that is largely down to what you DO. 
 Every day is a new opportunity to  change your mindset  and change your life. 
 **“  All you have to do is decide what to do with the time that’s been given you.  ” **~ Gandalf (Lord of the Rings) 
 The above is an extract from my eBook "  Do You Hate Your Job?  " available on Kindle but also available for  FREE  to my subscribers right here:  Send me a copy please!

 Back pain, headaches? - Listen to this NOW! 
 Hiya, 
 This is a blog about changing your life. It could be in your relationships, your health, your career, your goals etc. 
 Well today I wanted to share this powerful (and amusing) interview between Howard Stern and Dr John Sarno - a US doctor that explains how much of the chronic pain we sometimes suffer have no physical cause. 
 Relief from constant pain could change your life for the better in a more profound way than almost anything else. I know you are open minded enough to entertain the concepts talked about here. 
 Enjoy

 Do You Know The 4 Most Important Questions To Changing? 
 
 Crossing the River 
 Hiya, 
 A while back when I was getting ready to launch my book ' How To Change Your Life One Day At A Time ' I decided to create a street video to help promote it. 
 I had only one question that I wanted to ask of many complete strangers: WHAT ONE THING YOU WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE ABOUT YOURSELF? 
 I wanted to document how different people would answer the same question, based on their own lives and circumstances. What I found was in many, many cases their answer led me to ask another question, then another, then a final question. (A process I now call '  Crossing The River  '). 
 It was in these instances that those asked gave the most considered responses, delving deeper and deeper into the issue. In many cases they actually answered the most penetrating question they had probably been asked in years, if not decades. 
 They were as surprised by their answers as I was. 
 Remarkable considering that not one interview took more than two minutes to complete, AND they were complete strangers to me! 
 Many wanted to change things about their appearance, some about bad habits they had and some about the way they thought about themselves or others. I was moved and surprised at just how candid these people were, how open. I sincerely hope that some of them went home that day and actually made the change they said they wanted. 
 So what are the four questions you MUST ask yourself if you want to make any change in your life, whether it's to do with your relationships, your achievements, your lifestyle, your health, wealth and happiness or your career? 
 Bare in mind the change MUST be about YOU - not your boss, or your neighbour, or the economy or anything else that you cannot influence. 
 Get Help 
 Let me suggest that you get someone else to ask you these questions - a close friend or family member or even a colleague. Answer the first one before getting them to ask the second. Then answer  that  before they ask you the third, and so on. 
 Answer as quickly as possible too as this is where the revelation is, when your mind doesn't have time to dwell on and possibly filter the answer. It doesn't take long - as I said, of the 30 or so interviews I did on that cold day in February, not one took longer than two minutes! 
 Crossing The River 
 Here are the 4 questions: 
 1. What is the ONE thing you'd like to change about YOURSELF today? (This is not about your circumstances, this is about YOU.) 
 2.  Why  do you want to make that change? 
 3.  How  will you make that change? 
 4. What's stopping you? 
 Make a note of them, then forget about them until you have chosen someone to help you with this insightful exercise. If you decide you want to do them on your own then answer the first question NOW.  Quick  - answer! 
 To see the video  CLICK HERE  - it's 9 min 41 long, I hope you enjoy. 
 Take care
