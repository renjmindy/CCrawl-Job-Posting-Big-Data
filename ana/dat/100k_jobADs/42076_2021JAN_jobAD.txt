 Belen Chacon 
 July 13, 2013 
 You’ve been waiting for this moment for a long time. You’ve spent infinite hours applying to every job possible. You’ve told all your family and friends you’re looking for work. You’ve worked the computer, been to more  job fairs  than you can count, and even considered lowering your career standards by applying to jobs you’re overqualified for. You’ve had no luck in the past, but now all of your work has paid off and you couldn’t be happier. You’ve finally landed a job interview for a position  you   want . There’s only one slight problem: you’ve got nothing to wear. You don’t want to break the bank, but still want to look the part. So, where do you buy that  job interview outfit  that will surely impress that potential employer? Here’s a list of stores that will surely help you. 
 
 Forever 21 
 Need a new blazer to make you stand out as a professional? How about some accessories to enhance your chic look? Forever 21 has got you covered. With a variety of blazers for under $30 you’ll have plenty of change to shop for some of their affordable, yet classy, accessories. 
 Shop Publik 
 If you’re looking for cute affordable blouses to match that blazer, you might want to consider ShopPublik. Though some items are on the pricier side, they’ve got a sale section with sophisticated blouses that are sure to fit your budget. 
 Amazon 
 If online shopping is your thing, you might want to consider Amazon to help buy your job interview outfit. You can select from contemporary, trendy or relaxed outfits for both men and women to fit the look that’s right for you. 
 H&M 
 Let’s not forget about shoes. Whether you want boots, flats, loafers, or some traditional pumps, H&M has some good deals on dress shoes for all. 
 ZARA 
 Since winter is just around the corner, it might be a good idea for you to buy a fancy scarf that will keep you warm before entering that interview room. With some scarves starting out at just a little under $20, you won’t regret adding these fashionable scarves to your outfit from the ZARA store. 
 Macy’s 
 If you don’t have a lot of time to shop online before your interview, consider going to a department store like Macy’s. You are sure to find whatever you need there, but since we covered scarves why not also consider buying some sweaters? Macy’s has some colorful and trendy sweaters that will keep you warm and stylish during that interview. 
 New York & Company 
 New York & Company is definitely a smart choice when looking for career outfits that will grab anyone’s attention. From nice tops to pants for petite or tall women, this store is sure to impress and has items on clearance available for all fashion products. The next time you’re unsure of where to buy that job outfit that will help you land that position you’ve always wanted, consider looking through these stores to help amplify your look. Getting the right outfit is easy, and the last thing anyone should ever have to worry about is  what to wear for an interview . Photo Credit:  Shutterstock
