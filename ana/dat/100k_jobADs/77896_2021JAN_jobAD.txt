 Job Hunting Tips for New Graduates 
 ](https://workway.com/2018/05/29/job-hunting-tips-for-new-graduates/) 
 By  Workway Marketing 
 Let’s face it, looking for a job is one of life’s least enjoyable experiences. But it can be even more daunting when you’re a recent college graduate. It might be hard to imagine how you’ll fill your resume with information that will catch a hiring manager’s eye. The following tips will help you stand out among almost 2 million people who graduate each year. 
 Customize your Resume and Cover Letter 
 While you might not be able to fill your resume with loads of experience just yet, make sure you customize it for each job application. Look at the job description and the requirements, then tweak your resume with that position in mind. Don’t bury information that should be standing out. This goes for cover letters, as well. While the cover letter will add time and work, make sure and include one if it’s requested, even if optional. While not all recruiters and hiring managers will read cover letters, you’ll definitely stand out to those that do. 
 Social Media…Use it! 
 According to a recent survey conducted by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), 84% of employers utilize social media for recruiting purposes. Let that number sink in for a minute. And why do they use social media? Because it saves them a lot of time. Now get busy and update your LinkedIn profile. Enter information with the recruiter or hiring manager in mind. They’ll want to see information that displays a can-do attitude. List accomplishments, and do so dynamically and proudly. Stating that you were in a fraternity doesn’t say much. Now combine that with how you were a member of the finance committee that raised over $1 million for the construction of a new house speaks volumes. Dollar signs will get their attention. 
 Elevator Speech 
 If you don’t know by now what an elevator speech is, it’s a pitch, or sorts, that can be delivered in a short period of time. In this case, your elevator speech should be no longer than thirty (30) seconds, and list what you studied in school, your professional interests, the type of job you’re looking for, and how hiring you will be the best decision a company could make. Talking about yourself might be hard─it is for most─but you need to get over it. Practice your pitch, several times, so that you can deliver it by rote. But make it conversational and not too rehearsed. 
 Network, Network, Network 
 Tell everybody you come in contact with that you’re a recent─or soon to be─graduate. Combine this with your personal elevator speech. Ask them if they know of an employer who might be looking for a candidate with your background. Try to get two names to call from each person you speak to. Don’t worry about inconveniencing them; people like to help. It makes them feel good.  It will be rewarding to be an important part of helping you find a job. 
 Right now, like it or not, you’re in sales. But the good thing about job hunting is that you only have to close one sale.  You don’t have to walk around in a starched shirt and tailored suit all day, but you never know when you might encounter an audience for your elevator speech. Delivering it in cut-offs and flip flops reduces its impact. 
 If you have work experience (clerical, administrative, customer service rep, or any other position in one of our  business lines ) and would like to discuss a temporary or temp-to-hire position  contact Workway  today. We place qualified job-seekers in direct hire, temp-to-hire and temporary positions in a variety of fields, both regionally and nationally.
