 Top Advice for Job Seekers 
 
 February 8, 2018 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 One of the worst times in your life is when you are looking for a job. Being a job seeker is not very fun or pleasant, unless you are asking your boss for a promotion. When you are unemployed you have less confidence, and you worry about what you need to receive out of the job you are applying for rather than seeing it as an opportunity for something greater. If you are a job seeker, and you want to land your dream job, or you just want to get that promotion, then here you will find some top advice for job seekers: 
 
 
 Explore your Talents 
 
 
 The first thing, and one of the most important things, as a job seeker is to know yourself. This is not be a philosophy course, but anyone seeking to find a job should know themselves completely, identifying your talents and what makes you tick. The top advice for job seekers is to ask yourself what you excel at, what you like to do, and why you are the most qualified person for the job. You have to remember that the job that you get, you should enjoy doing, and not hate, because a job takes up a majority of your time. Use your natural talents and you will be admired when you are interviewed. 
 
 Be Ambitious 
 
 Aim high and reach for the stars, don’t lower your expectations when you are job seeking, even though it may seem safer to get a job. Even if you feel you are not fully qualified for the job you are seeking, the best advice is to apply anyway. You should never limit yourself to just one position. Who knows, you could still get the job, just because you are the person you are. If you are interviewed, they may not give you the job you are wanting, but may offer you another position within the company. That is the first step in getting the job of your dreams. You have to start somewhere. 
 
 Be open 
 
 Another piece of advice is to always keep an open mind when you are searching for a job, even if the job is not what you really want. It may just be a stepping stone to a better job. Always apply for every job that you have some knowledge of, because if you fail to do this, then the companies will not know about you. Remember tip number two, get that interview, then you can show the employer what skills you really have. 
 
 You WILL find a job 
 
 The most important advice for job seekers that you should heed (and this goes for all aspects of life) is never give up. Keep searching and keep knocking on all doors. Let everyone know that you are looking for a job and what talents you have to offer. Use social media to your advantage, it can help you. LinkedIn and Twitter are great social media outlets. They can help you connect to a job that you are interested in. Send out application with your social media attached. You never know who is reading your social media pages, and they may contact you for a job.
