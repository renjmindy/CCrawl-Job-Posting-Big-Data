 Job tracking without the hassle 
 Having trouble keeping up with all the details? WorkWeek is the assistant you’ve been looking for. 
 
 Centralized job management 
 With WorkWeek, everything is connected to the job: customer details, estimates, invoices, and any appointments you have scheduled for the job. 
 It’s all in one place which makes your jobs easy to find and manage. See everything at a glance, or dive into the details of an invoice or appointment from one central location. 
 Automated customer feedback 
 Checking up on customers to see if they’re happy with your work can be time consuming and tricky to fit into a busy schedule. WorkWeek handles it all for you. 
 When a job is marked as complete, we’ll email the customer a couple of weeks later to ask them how you did. If they’re happy we’ll ask them if they would like to leave a review or testimonial, which can be posted to your website or even your Facebook page. 
 Notes and pictures 
 Need to keep up with details about the job like paint colors, gate codes, or a shopping list for the hardware store? 
 WorkWeek jobs can have multiple notes attached to them, and they’re a great place to add anything related to the job that you need to remember. No more sticky notes on the dashboard or pictures lost on your phone.
