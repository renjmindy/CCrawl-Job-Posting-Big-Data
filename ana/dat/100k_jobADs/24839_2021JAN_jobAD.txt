 !!NOW HIRINIG!!

 Do I have your attention? Between the all-caps headline, exclamation points and obvious misspelling of “hiring,” I’d say this blog post is hard to miss. I found inspiration from a number of blunders in the following job ad, printed in the  Orlando Sentinel  last week. Go ahead, take a look. 
 While I cringed at the typos throughout and overall design, the real crime lay in its call-to-action. Imagine you are applying for one of these positions. You go to your computer and type in the following: 
 I tried it out. It took me a minute and a half to enter the URL into my browser, oh so carefully to get it right, and my fingers are usually ablaze at the keyboard. Admittedly, I had to hit backspace several times. They could have saved their applicants a lot of grief with a vanity URL. 
 This ad may have originally been designed for online placement (a very lengthy one, at that), but even so, why the need for such a long URL? Why no consideration of its other uses? 
 No matter the form of communication, consider your medium. Does your communication work across different channels? And please (pretty please), ask someone to proofread. 
 
 In full disclosure, Curley & Pynn represents Universal Orlando Resort. My comments are my opinion and not meant to be a swipe at Disney (where I began my career and learned so much) or Planet Hollywood (where I enjoy eating), in any way.

 Dangers of Cut & Paste 
 September 26, 2017

 by Roger Pynn 
 I always feel bad when I’m reviewing résumés and come across an applicant who self-eliminates with a stupid mistake. I feel bad because I long ago decided it isn’t my job to teach someone to read what they write before sticking it in the mail. 
 Today’s example was a chap who appeared to be a pretty good fit for a job we have open (  see description below if you are someone interested in joining a really good PR firm that demands excellence of itself to provide excellent service to excellent clients  ). However, he sent a cover letter along with his résumé and some writing samples in which he clearly had cut and pasted a paragraph from another cover letter he’s using in his job search. 
 His opening paragraph was OK:  “ _I am writing to express my interest in the position of Communication Specialist with Curley & Pynn. As a communications professional with over a decade of experience reaching out to the public I know what it takes to get people talking._” 
 But two paragraphs down things went south:  “ _I will love to be able to bring my assets to  The Florida Bar Foundation  as your next Marketing Coordinator and Social Media Coordinator. I am excited about this opportunity and welcome the opportunity to discuss with you my credentials. Please contact me to arrange an interview. I look forward to meeting you and thank you for your consideration._” 
 No … the boldface and underlines were not his, but added for emphasis. I just wanted to make sure you saw it. I let slide that this guy actually said, “I will love to be able to …” Lord, this guy has a college degree! Albeit, from an online school I’ve never heard of before. He positions himself as a  “  Seasoned bilingual communications professional experienced in network, cable and local news, with both English-language and Spanish-language speaking audiences.  ” 
 Now … to the real reason I wrote this post. We’re looking for good talent. Please see below, email us or pass the word. Extra points to those that get our name right. 
 
 It’s time to stop “working” and start getting paid to do what you love. At Curley & Pynn – The Strategic Firm®, our award-winning team of creative thinkers is excited to offer you this opportunity. As a communications specialist, you can do big things in an environment that will challenge you to contribute 100 percent every day, while empowering you to succeed.

 Research, research, research. It’s the bedrock of every communications plan. 
 Write compelling stories about our clients, their products and services for news releases, blogs, social media posts and more. 
 Publicize those stories by pitching them to news media, developing eye-catching collateral, planning and executing events, and more.

 What you need: 
 
 Bachelor’s degree in communications, marketing, public relations, journalism or a related field. 
 Overwhelming desire to grow your career.

 Annoying obsession with details. 
 No fear to call a reporter, get rejected and call again. 
 Confidence to raise your hand and take responsibility for new projects. 
 Penchant for to-do lists and ability to juggle. 
 
 Ideally, you’ve had some on-the-job experience and are ready for the next step in your career. Solid internships and a high level of maturity go a long way, too. Experience with graphic design and digital marketing will earn you bonus points.
