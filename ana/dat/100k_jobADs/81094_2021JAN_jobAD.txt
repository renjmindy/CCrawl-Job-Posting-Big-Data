 Careers, Job Search & Covid-19: What You NEED To Know 
     J.T. O'Donnell 
 and 
     Work It Daily 
 March 27, 2020 
 I've gotten a TON of questions regarding career, job search, management, and layoffs lately. A lot of people are wondering what's happening to businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, and what it means for their career. 
 Today, I want to talk about how the coronavirus outbreak can affect your career, and job search and what you can do about it! 
 
 **** "I know it can be easy to say "oh, there's no jobs right now, what's the point?" The whole point is to prepare now so that you are completely ready to go when the jobs open up again." 
 In this episode, I answer questions such as: 
 
 "What can I do to recession-proof my job?" 
 "Is it even worth putting the effort in to find a job right now?" 
 "What advice do you have for students graduating college and young professionals who have never been through a crisis like this before?" 
 
 
If you have similar questions or concerns, this episode is for you. I'm answering these questions openly and honestly, and at the end of the day, I truly believe these answers will help you with your career growth and job search.
