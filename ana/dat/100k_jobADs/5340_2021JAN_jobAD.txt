 Posted in  News  by  WordstoDeeds 
 The Court of Justice of the EU in Luxembourg is currently looking for lawyer-linguists with  Danish, Finnish, Slovak, Slovenian or Swedish  as their main language. 
 The Translation Service is responsible for the translation of documents related to the proceedings brought before the three EU Courts - the Court of Justice, the General Court and the Civil Service Tribunal. Some 600 lawyer-linguists take care of the daily translation needs. Translation is carried out under mandatory language rules and covers the official languages of the EU. 
 As a lawyer-linguist at the Court, you will be translating judgments, orders, Opinions of the Advocates General and procedural documents. You will play an important role in the communication between the parties and the judges. You will also give advice on legal terminology and provide legal analysis in cooperation with the Registries and other departments of the Court. 
 You will need a suitable law degree in your main language and a thorough knowledge of two other official EU languages. 
 You have until 1/07/2014  , 12.00 (Brussels time)  to apply for one of these competitions. 
 Information can be found at the EU careers website  here .
