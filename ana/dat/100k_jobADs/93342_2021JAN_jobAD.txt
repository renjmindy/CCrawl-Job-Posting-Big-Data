  How To Achieve Your Career Goals: Do Whatever It Takes!  
 Bud Bilanich 
 September 23, 2011 
 Success Tweet : Aim high. Set and achieve high goals – month after month, and year after year. Do whatever it takes to achieve your career goals.  This post is more about  goal achievement  than goal setting. You know you need to set goals in all parts of your life. You know you need to set S.M.A.R.T. goals. You know you need break your goals into manageable milestones. You know you need to keep your goals with you. You know you need to write your goals and share them with others. All of this is a great start. However, it’s just the start. Successful people do whatever it takes to achieve their goals. This takes commitment and tenacity. It means working towards you goals when you are tired. It means not giving up in the face of problems and setbacks. It means doing what needs to be done, not what you want to do, or feel like doing. This reminds me of one of my favorite quotes from Malcolm Forbes… 
 
 “Diamonds are nothing more than chunks of coal that stuck to their jobs.” 
 
 It takes thousands of years and tremendous amounts of pressure to turn coal into diamonds. While you don’t need to spend thousands of years creating the successful life and career you want and deserve, you do have to stick with it. If you give up every time you run into a problem, setback or roadblock you’ll never become a diamond. If you can’t take the pressure, you’ll never become a diamond. You have to stick to it and bare up under the pressure. It doesn’t take a career success coach to tell you you need to be persistent if you’re going to achieve your goals. I am a fan of Lindsey Vonn, an Olympic gold medal winning alpine skier who makes her home in Vail; so she’s a local as far as I’m concerned. She is the most successful American woman skier in World Cup history. She’s 26 years old and has been skiing for 24 of those years. She moved away from home and her family at a young age to pursue her dream of being a world class skier. She started skiing competitively at 7 and competing internationally when she was nine. She is devoted to her sport. Check out what Lindsay Vonn says about going for your goals… 
 
 “When you fall down, just get up again. If you fall, get up stronger, hungrier, more ambitious. Setbacks help you concentrate. When success falls into your lap, you lose sight of your goals.” 
 
 She fell hard earlier this year and had a terrible bone bruise on her arm. She didn’t miss an event. She had a terrible injury just prior to the Olympics and still won the gold medal in the downhill – the most prestigious skiing event – in the 2010 Winter Games. I tell my career success coach clients Lindsey Vonn is someone who can be likened to a lump of coal that has turned into a diamond because she’s stuck to her job. Remember her story the next time you feel like giving up on your goals and your dreams. The common sense career success coach point here is simple. Successful people commit to taking personal responsibility for their lives and careers. They follow the  career advice  in Tweet 29 in  Success Tweets  ,  “Aim high. Set and achieve high goals – month after month, and year after year. Do whatever it takes to achieve your goals.”  You can begin achieving your career success goals by taking personal responsibility for your life and career success. Do whatever it takes to succeed. Stick with it when the pressure gets strong. Do whatever it takes to achieve the life and career success goals you set for yourself. Respond positively to the negative people and events in your life. Remember what Malcolm Forbes has to say about success,  “Diamonds are nothing more than chunks of coal that stuck to their jobs.”  Become a diamond. Stick with it. Set high goals, achieve them. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.
