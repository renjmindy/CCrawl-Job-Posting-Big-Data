 "My Portion is God" ( Psalm 73:25-26 WYC ) by Carley Evans 
 March 1, 2014March 1, 2014   lambskinny Leave a comment 
 
 For why what is to me in heaven; and what would I of thee on earth? (For what is there for me in heaven, but thee? and what else do I desire here on earth, but thee?) My flesh and mine heart failed; God of mine heart, and my part  is  God [into] without end. (Though my flesh and my heart fail; but God is my strength, and my portion forever.) 
 
 David could be the weary and suffering Job in this passage. Here David speaks perhaps after the shame of murdering Uriah so as to have Bathsheba; perhaps after the death of his son. At any rate, David sings that even if his flesh and heart fail, God is his strength and his portion forever. David rhetorically asks,  What else in heaven and earth do I desire?  And his answer is,  Nothing but You, God. 
 This truth is what Job discovers in his ordeal. At the end of his rope, so to speak, Job realizes that only God matters, that everything else is a pale shadow compared to Him. Job's devotion to God does not, however, diminish his love of others or his view of himself. Rather, as Job falls in humility before God, God lifts him up and places him above where he was in the first place. 
 What do we desire?

 "God Is Everywhere" ( Psalms 138:8, KNOX ) by Carley Evans

 Satan before the Lord (Photo credit: Wikipedia) 
 
 If I should climb up to heaven, thou art there; if I sink down to the world beneath, thou art present still. ( Psalms 138:8, KNOX ) 
 
 A puzzle here in David's words and in the oral rendition of the story of Job -  God is everywhere!  We imagine God is incapable of being in the presence of evil, but that is obviously not so. Yes, He turns from His Son at the Cross when all the sins of the world attach themselves to Jesus; but God is found even if we climb to the heavens or descend to the realms of death and hell. That the Lord comes into the presence of the Enemy, Satan is evident in the beginning moments of the story of Job. 
 
 6 One day, when the heavenly powers stood waiting upon the Lord’s presence, and among them, man’s Enemy, 7 the Lord asked him, where he had been? Roaming about the earth, said he, to and fro about the earth.8 Why then, the Lord said, thou hast seen a servant of mine called Job. Here is a true man, an honest man, none like him on earth; ever he fears his God, and keeps far from wrong-doing. 9 Job fears his God, the Enemy answered, and loses nothing by it. 10 Sheltered his life by thy protection, sheltered his home, his property; thy blessing on all he undertakes; worldly goods that still go on increasing; he loses nothing. 11 One little touch of thy hand, assailing all that wealth of his! Then see how he will turn and blaspheme thee. 12 Be it so, the Lord answered; with all his possessions do what thou wilt, so thou leave himself unharmed. And with that, the Enemy left the Lord’s presence, and withdrew. ( Job 1: 6-12, KNOX ) 
 
 God's ability and willingness to be in the presence of the Enemy is nearly as difficult to understand and accept as His ability and willingness to suffer and die. God  is  engaged with death and evil. To think He is not is to misunderstand Him. God does not create death and evil; but He allows both. In so many ways, He uses both. Why? 
 Some would say, "To manifest His Power."

 "On The Dust At Last" ( Job 19:25, HCSB ) by Carley Evans 
 April 29, 2012   lambskinny 2 Comments 
 Job's Peak (Photo credit: glenngould) 
 
 “But I know my living Redeemer, and He will stand on the dust at last.” 
 
 When Job says this, he has not yet met the Lord. He has heard of the Lord God "by report" but he has yet to "see God with his own eyes." Even so, Job knows that God lives; and he trusts that one day God "will stand on the dust at last." Job understands God will overcome sin in mankind and so defeat death, the wage of sin. 
 What Job doesn't know is the fullness of God; he doesn't yet have a personal, face-to-face relationship with the living Redeemer. He has yet to "abhor himself and repent in dust and ashes." At this point, he has only heard; he has yet to see!

 "God Proves Me As I Pass Through Fire" ( Job 23:10-11, WYC ) by Carley Evans 
 March 2, 2012March 2, 2012   lambskinny 1 Comment 
 I don't think Job says it much differently than "God proves me as I pass through fire" as I indicate via the title of this little note. Job must feel as if the fires of hell are descending upon him as his children, his servants, his animals die, and as his own body is attacked. Yet, he denies sin. He cries out: 
 
 10 But [God] knoweth my way, and he shall prove me as gold (and he shall assay me like gold), that passeth through the fire. 
 11 My foot followed his steps; I kept (to) his way, and I bowed not away from it. 
 
 Job claims to follow God's steps, to keep to His way, and to not stray from the truth. His friends protest, saying that can't possibly be true; but God scolds them. 
 Job continues to maintain his innocence until God confronts with this: "Who are you to question Me?" God says to Job, "Brace yourself like a man; I question you, and you will answer Me." (Job 38:3, NIV)

 "Dead Works" ( Hebrews 9: 14, ESV ) by Carley Evans 
 July 14, 2011July 14, 2011   lambskinny 3 Comments 
 "How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God." 
 What are these "dead works" the author of Hebrews mentions? I want to travel back to Job, and suggest that the good things Job did in his life are "dead works." "All our good deeds are as filthy rags" to the Lord God. 
 "Only in the Lord, it shall be said of Me, are righteousness and strength." (Isaiah 45:24) "Remember this and stand firm, recall it to mind, you transgressors, remember the former things of old; for I Am God, and there is no other; I Am God, and there is none like Me, declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not done, saying, 'My counsel shall stand and I will accomplish all My purpose." (Isaiah 46:8-10) 
 "Woe to him who strives with Him who formed him, a pot among earthen pots! Does the clay say to him who forms it, 'What are you making?' or 'Your work has no handles'? Woe to him who says to a father, 'What are you begetting?' or to a woman, 'With what are you in labor?' " (Isaiah 45:9-10) 
 Do not argue with your Creator. Don't be fooled into believing that if you do this and don't do that, if you strive with all your might to be good, you somehow please Him. Believe instead that Christ "entered once for all into the holy places, not by means of the blood of goats and calves but by means of His own blood, thus securing eternal redemption." (Hebrews 9:12) Believe that "we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all." (Hebrews 10:10) 
 As we have been delivered from "dead works," we are now free "to serve the living God."

 "His To Use" ( Job 12: 16, NEB ) by Carley Evans 
 May 7, 2011May 7, 2011   lambskinny Leave a comment 
 "In God's hand are the souls of all that live, the spirits of all human kind. Wisdom and might are His, with Him are firmness and understanding. If He pulls down, there is no rebuilding; if He imprisons, there is no release. If He holds up the waters, there is drought; if He lets them go, they turn the land upside down. Strength and success belong to Him, deceived and deceiver are His to use." (Job 12:10-16, NEB) 
 In the midst of his suffering, Job says it best -- all belong to God. All are His to use in whatever fashion He deems perfect. 
 "He leads people astray and destroys them, He lays them low, and there they lie." (Job 12:23) Look at Pharaoh if there is any doubt. 
 "What shall we say to that? Is God to be charged with injustice? By no means. For He says to Moses, 'Where I show mercy, I will show mercy, and where I pity, I will pity.' Thus it does not depend on man's will or effort, but on God's mercy. For Scripture says to Pharaoh, 'I have raised you up for this very purpose, to exhibit My power in My dealings with you, and to spread My fame over all the world.' Thus He not only shows mercy as He chooses, but also makes men stubborn as He chooses. You will say, 'Then why does God blame a man? For who can resist His will?' Who are you, sir, to answer God back? Can the pot speak to the potter and say, 'Why did you make me like this?' Surely the potter can do what he likes with the clay." (Romans 9:14-21)

 "One Mediator" ( 1 Timothy 2: 5-6, NIV ) by Carley Evans 
 March 29, 2011   lambskinny Leave a comment 
 Job, in his terror, longs for a mediator, one who will state his case to God. Job cries out, "If only there were someone to arbitrate between us, to lay His hand upon us both, someone to remove God's rod from me, so that His terror would frighten me no more. Then I would speak up without fear of Him, but as it now stands with me, I cannot." (Job 9:33-35) 
 Job wisely asks, "Who can bring what is pure from the impure?" (Job 14:4) And, he just as wisely answers, "No one!" (Job 14:4) Because Job despairs yet hopes, he begs: "If only You would hide me in the grave and conceal me till Your anger has passed! If only You would set me a time and then remember me! If a man dies, will he live again? All the days of my hard service, I will wait for my renewal to come. You will call and I will answer You; You will long for the creature Your hands have made. Surely then You will count my steps but not keep track of my sin. My offenses will be sealed in a bag; You will cover over my sin." (Job 14:13-17) 
 What Job hopes, Paul confirms: "God our Savior…wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth." (1 Timothy 2:3-4) Here, Paul shows that Job's prayer is answered. "For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself as a ransom for all men -- the testimony given in its proper time." (1 Timothy 2:5-6) 
 Job's sins are finally "covered over" and "sealed in a bag." God's "anger has passed!" Job is indeed "remembered;" his "renewal comes" and "he lives again."

 "Where Is Job?" ( Job 1: 8, NIV ) by Carley Evans 
 March 19, 2011March 19, 2011   lambskinny Leave a comment 
 Where does it say that God knows the location of His servant, Job? In the Book of Job, the angels come "to present themselves before the Lord." (Job 1:6) Satan is present with these angels. God says to Satan, "Have you considered My servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil." (Job 1:8) 
 God's question implies that He knows where Job is located and what he is doing. 
 Jesus confirms, "There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known." (Matthew 10:26) We are not capable of hiding from God. Remember, "even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So don't be afraid." (Matthew 10:30)

 "God Knows Me In Action Or At Rest" ( Job 23: 10, NEB ) by Carley Evans 
 March 3, 2011March 3, 2011   lambskinny Leave a comment 
 Job is in despair. He cries out, "If I go forward, [God] is not there; if backward, I cannot find Him; when I turn left, I do not descry Him; I face right, but I see Him not. But He knows me in action or at rest; when He tests me, I prove to be gold." Essentially, Job is saying: "I may not be able to feel God's presence; I may not be able to figure out His plans for me, but He knows me. Whether I am at work or at play, awake or asleep; God knows my going in and my coming out. He knows my motives. He knows that I am pure." Yes, Job claims that when God tests him, he will "prove to be gold." He even lists the sins he has not committed in a long tirade against God. (Job 31:2-37) 
 Bildad the Shulite tells his friend, Job, "How…can a man be justified in God's sight, or one born of woman be innocent? If the circling moon is found wanting, and the stars are not innocent in His eyes, much more so man who is but a maggot, mortal man who is only a worm." (Job 25:4-6) 
 Job is utterly frustrated by Bildad's complete lack of support. He groans, "What help you have given to the man without resource, what deliverance you have brought to the powerless! What counsel you offer to a man at his wit's end, what sound advice to the foolish!" (Job 26:2-3) 
 And though Job believes he will "prove to be gold," he does recognize that "no man knows the way to [wisdom]" as "it is not found in the land of living men." (Job 28:13) He asks, "Where then does wisdom come from, and where is the source of understanding? No creature on earth can see it… But God understands the way to it, He alone knows its source; for He can see to the ends of the earth and He surveys everything under heaven." (Job 28:20-21,23-24) 
 Job comes close to understanding how lame it is to argue with God who "can see to the ends of the earth and…survey everything." Job's own perspective is so incredibly limited when compared to God's. When God does finally speak to him, Job has the good sense to say, "What reply can I give Thee, I who carry no weight? I put my finger to my lips. I have spoken once and now will not answer again; twice I have spoken, and I will do so no more." (Job 40:4-5) 
 In the end, in the face of God's wisdom and His omniscience -- there is little left to do except bow to His will. Thankfully, God's will is perfect.

 "In God's Hand" ( Job 12: 10, NEB ) by Carley Evans 
 February 19, 2011   lambskinny Leave a comment 
 Job argues, "In God's hand are the souls of all that live, the spirits of all human kind. Wisdom and might are His, with Him are firmness and understanding. If He pulls down, there is no rebuilding; if He imprisons, there is no release." (Job 12:10-14) "Deceived and deceiver are His to use." (Job 12:16) "Will you quibble with Him as you quibble with a man?" (Job 13:9) 
 Job warns his friends that God "is not a man as I am, that I can answer Him or that we can confront one another in court. If only there were one to arbitrate between us and impose his authority on us both, so that God might take His rod from my back, and terror of Him might not come on me suddenly. I would then speak without fear of Him; for I know I am not what I am thought to be." (Job 9:32-35) 
 Job laments that "man born of woman is short-lived and full of disquiet. He blossoms like a flower and then he withers; he slips away like a shadow and does not stay; he is like a wine-skin that perishes or a garment that moths have eaten." (Job 14:1-2) 
 Job pleads, "I tell you, God Himself has put me in the wrong, He has drawn the net round me. He has walled in my path so that I cannot break away, and He has hedged in the road before me." (Job 19:6,8) "Pity me, pity me, you that are my friends; for the hand of God has touched me. Why do you pursue me as God pursues me? Have you not had your teeth in me long enough?" (Job 19:21-22) 
 That Job is in deep despair is evident; he knows he is essentially innocent of wrongdoing and yet has lost all for no good reason he can fathom. He only knows God has set him as His target. He is weary of the disloyalty of his friends; and longs not to have been born. Nevertheless, Job hopes for "one to arbitrate between" himself and God; someone who can "impose His authority on us both, so that God might take His rod from my back." 
 Job says, God "decides, and who can turn Him from His purpose? He does what He determines, that He carries out; His mind is full of plans like these. Therefore I am fearful of meeting Him; when I think about Him, I am afraid; it is God who makes me faint-hearted and the Almighty who fills me with fear." (Job 23:13-16) 
 Yet, Job maintains his innocence. He says to his friends,"God forbid that I should allow you to be right; till death I will not abandon my claim to innocence. I will maintain the rightness of my cause, I will never give up; so long as I live, I will not change." (Job 27:5-6) 
 Then, surprisingly, God Himself speaks to Job. God asks, "Is it for a man who disputes with the Almighty to be stubborn? Should he that argues with God answer back? (Job 40:2) "Dare you deny that I Am just or put Me in the wrong that you may be right?" (Job 40:8) 
 Job finally understands. He answers God, "I know that Thou canst do all things and that no purpose is beyond Thee. But I spoke of great things which I do not understand, things too wonderful for me to know. I knew of Thee then only by report, but now I see Thee with my own eyes. Therefore I melt away; I repent in dust and ashes." (Job 42:2-6)

 SEEKING PROFITS 
 "Every day, people seek profits for the investments they make in time, in effort, in monies. Every day, some people win -- what seems to them -- "the whole world." I'm not sure Jesus equates winning the whole world with loss of one's soul. Rather, I think Jesus implies one's focus ought not to be on getting "the whole world", but on getting a relationship with Him so as to keep one's soul." 
 HOLDING FAST TO GOOD 
 “Holding fast to the good is such a map for happiness. If you see the good in the other, then you are able to bless the other even as he curses you. If you see the good in the moment, then you will not repay evil for evil. Instead you will do what is perceived as honorable to all. Such a paradox exists in the Christian walk. We walk by faith, hoping for that which is unseen. Our hope is that good will outdo evil, that perfection will triumph over imperfection, that God will be triumphant over the evil one. And of course God is triumphant and good does overcome evil. Perfection does overwhelm imperfection, and holiness swallows sin. Therefore, let your love be true.”
