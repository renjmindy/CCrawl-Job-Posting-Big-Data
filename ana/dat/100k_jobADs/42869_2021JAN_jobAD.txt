 The physician, ornament of the elite 
 November 18, 2017November 19, 2017   physician21 
 A physician counts always within the high ranks of the society to which authority and influence are ascribed. For many lay people a physician is shadowed by image of a magician who claims to have drawn from a divine source of knowledge and wisdom or have such heavenly assignment of inspiration and prophecy. People shall always ask whether their "Doctor" was naturally assigned, genetically prepared or were just a fake figure that would be expelled sooner or later. 
 Unique to the physician's prerequisite is the accomplishment of an incredible triad of nobility, knowledge and wealth. Nobility is a character that confers impressions of superiority، satisfaction and abundance. It would best manifest itself in matters related to moral rewards, physical lusts and materialistic gains. The knowledge necessary for a physician is versatile and can be subject to handling. In such overwhelming topic of general knowledge several aspects may be lightly dispensed with without grave drops except those concerning people's behavior, believes and convincing. 
 The third pillar in the incredible physician's triad is the inclination toward financial resources and proprietary assets. That awareness of the role of financial stability and abundance shall positively impact the continuous knowledge and training acquisition besides fulfilling the expected and intuitive image of the successful Doctor. The financial resources would include medical support establishments, grants, intellectual property rights and medical services compensations or fees.

 Mustafa was raised in a middle class family as 7th kid among a total of 8 kids. He enjoyed much love and joy in his family yet with often happening embarrassments. His intelligence was quite apparent for everybody and he adopted a straight and honest conduct while still a child of a few years of age. School achievements and academic brilliance were obvious in the middle school years where he used to be ranked first without appreciable concurrence. The young man could be described as a potential polymath as he showed interests in many scientific and literary subjects. Mustafa’s lingual competence may be appreciated in language performances, both spoken and written. The author won a few scholarship opportunities that remarkably refined his scientific and humanistic perceptions.
