  Why You Shouldn't Write "To Whom It May Concern" On Your Cover Letter  
 Jenna Arcand 
 October 29, 2020 
   
 Many job seekers still don't understand how important cover letters are in their job search. Your cover letter has the power to turn your job application from a "maybe" to a "yes." Even the little details, like how you address your cover letter, can impact a hiring manager's decision whether to give you a call or not. 
 As a job seeker, there are many ways you can choose to address your cover letter. But, there's one you should never use‚Äîno matter the circumstances. Here's why you shouldn't write "To Whom It May Concern" on your cover letter: 
 It's Impersonal 
 The whole point of your cover letter (a  disruptive cover letter , at least) is to connect with the employer. How can you do that when you begin your cover letter with such an impersonal greeting?  When you write "To Whom It May Concern" on your cover letter, you've already lost an opportunity to be warm and friendly. This type of greeting is cold and formal, something you'd see in business correspondence. Maybe a cover letter was considered a form of business correspondence back in the day, but it's much more than that now. So, skip the formality. Your cover letter should be personal. It should tell a story‚Äîthe story of why you want to work for the company, why you're passionate about what they do, and how you believe you can help them achieve their goals as an organization. And no good story ever began with "To Whom It May Concern."  
 It's Outdated 
 If you write "To Whom It May Concern" on your cover letter, there's a good chance the hiring manager will think you're old-fashioned, if they didn't already think so after  reviewing your resume . In the job search, it's all about relevancy. By using such an outdated greeting in your cover letter, the hiring manager will also begin to question just how relevant your skills are, or if you're still relevant in your industry. Simply put, "To Whom It May Concern" is outdated, old-fashioned, and can bring into question your relevancy as a professional, a business-of-one. That's not something you ever want.  
 It's Lazy 
 Writing "To Whom It May Concern" on your cover letter might've been completely fine before the internet and rise of  professional networking sites like LinkedIn . But now, information about who works at a certain company, and their roles within an organization, is freely available and out there for anybody to find. You just have to look for it. That's why when you use this type of cover letter greeting, it can come off as lazy. The hiring manager may think you didn't care enough about the job opening to properly address the cover letter to the person who'd be reading it. So, do you really care about getting the job? Do you really want the job? If you're lazy even before you get the job, would someone be wrong to assume you'd probably be lazy on the job as well?  In the job search, you never want to do the bare minimum. Writing "To Whom It May Concern" on your cover letter is the bare minimum. A little research never hurt anybody. Before starting your cover letter, try to find the name of the hiring manager at the company you're applying to. If you can't, writing "Dear hiring team," or "Dear hiring manager," will work just fine. 
 How you address your cover letter is more important than you think. Every little detail can impact a hiring manager's impression of you. So, whatever you do, avoid the impersonal, outdated, and lazy greeting of "To Whom It May Concern," on your next cover letter. You'll thank us later.  Need more help with your job search?

  3 Tips For Sending Your Cover Letter To Employers  
 Ariella Coombs 
 Jenna Arcand 
 October 05, 2020 
   
 Not sure of the right way to send your cover letter to employers? There are some critical things you should keep in mind. 
 You already understand how important it is to  write a disruptive cover letter  for each position. But, how do you send your cover letter to employers without making a mistake? Here are three tips for successfully sending your cover letter to employers: 
 1. PDF It 
 Always send your cover letter as a PDF so your formatting doesn't get screwed up, unless you're instructed differently by the employer. Why? Because your attachments can be sent to multiple people within the company and you don't want your amazing cover letter to get lost at the bottom of an email chain. So, let's make things easy. Saving and sending your cover letter as a PDF should be the default. There will be less confusion on their end and you can be sure that your cover letter is being viewed in the  correct format  and won't take away from the appeal of your entire job application.  
 2. Proofread! 
 Proofread like six times. If you think you've proofread it enough, do it once more. This is one of your  first impressions . Make it a good one! Don't let typos or grammatical errors hurt your brand. It also doesn't hurt to have another set of eyes review your cover letter before you send it out. Ask a trusted friend or colleague to proofread your cover letter and give any feedback they may have on format, sentence structure, or clarity. Does the story you tell in your cover letter covey everything you want to say effectively, without spelling and grammatical errors?  
 3. Leave Out The Email Address Until The Last Minute 
 Don't put the email address in until you're 100% sure your message is perfect. You don't want to accidentally send in your job application without attaching your cover letter or reviewing its contents on more time.  Bonus tip:  Your email message should be your cover letter, unless the employer specifically says to attach your cover letter to the email. 
 Writing and sending cover letters to employers can be tricky. Follow these three tips to ensure your cover letter makes a great first impression. Looking for more job search help?

  4 Red Flags Employers Watch For On Cover Letters  
 Don Goodman 
 Jenna Arcand 
 September 11, 2020 
   
 Before getting into what should or shouldn't be on your cover letter, let's just get out of the way that a cover letter is a must. Why? Well, the answer is pretty simple. 
 The cover letter gives you the chance to express that you're a professional and that you have the skills, expertise, and passion the employer is seeking in an ideal job candidate. When you don't send a cover letter with your resume, it can be interpreted as you're not that serious about the job‚Äîthat it's not even worth your time and effort to include a greeting that will put your information in context to the employer's needs. Writing a cover letter is particularly important if your resume raises red flags when reviewed on its own. Things like a lengthy period of unemployment, smaller  job gaps , or no specialized training for a job that requires it needs some explaining to alleviate concern. So, here's what you need to be watchful of in your cover letter so that it works effectively with your resume. 
 1. You Didn't Customize Your Cover Letter 
 Like the resume, your cover letter needs to be customized and speak directly to the employer's needs. It shouldn't simply say, "I'm interested in the job and here's my resume for review." If you're going to do that, then it's the same as not sending a cover letter at all. The best way to customize your cover letter is to go all in and  write a disruptive cover . Speak of your knowledge in the business, what you know about that employer, why you're passionate about their mission, product, or service, and how your experience and skills can help the employer reach their goals. Provide highlights from your resume and how you can apply what you learned in past positions to the job you're looking to land at their organization.  Basically, if the employer can feel your excitement through the cover letter, and is impressed by the story you tell, you'll be one of the first job candidates they contact to learn more. 
 2. You Left Important Questions Unanswered 
 There are some things on your resume that may raise a red flag, and if they go unexplained, the hiring manager will not take a chance on you. They'll just move on to the next candidate. Consider things like periods of unemployment,  lack of degree or certification , frequent job changes, or a change in direction of career that may require more information. The point is not to over-explain, but to touch on the subject in short to offer reason that will alleviate potential concern. For example, you may have taken a year off from work to care for a newborn or sick parent. Tell that story in your disruptive cover letter. Also, your disruptive cover letter should begin to answer some of the questions the employer will want to find out for sure if you come in for a job interview. Some of those questions include: Can you save or make the company money? Are you passionate about what we do? Will you stay with the company long enough for us to see a return on investment from hiring you as an employee? Do you want to grow as a professional at the company? The sooner you can answer these questions for the employer, the easier it will be for you to move on in the hiring process. And it all starts with a great cover letter.  
 3. You Didn't Proofread 
 Your cover letter is a reflection of your professionalism. If it's filled with misspellings or poor grammar, the employer will be left to believe you are careless‚Äîa direct reflection of how you may  perform on the job . Let's be honest: if you really care about getting the job you're applying for, you'll proofread your cover letter and resume multiple times. If you don't seem inclined to proofread all of your career materials before sending in your application, the job probably isn't the right one for you. Nevertheless, make sure you proofread your cover letter. When in doubt, have a trusted friend look it over, too! 
 4. You Didn't Follow Directions 
 Many employers will leave specific directions in the job posting for applicants to follow. It can be as simple as including XYZ in the subject line when your email message is serving as the cover letter, including your salary requirement, or providing an answer to a question. Since many employers get more applicants than they need, any one applicant who fails to follow directions is an automatic strike out. While writing your cover letter, follow any directions the employer has on the  job posting . Same goes for when you send it out. Even if your cover letter is amazing, not following the directions can hurt your chances of landing an interview!  
 Your cover letter is the best opportunity for you to stand out to employers early on in the hiring process, so take the time to write one that is polished and speaks directly to the employer's needs.

  7 Things That May Surprise You About The Job Search Process  
 Aaron Sanborn 
 August 28, 2020 
   
 Unless you've been really lucky, you've probably discovered this simple fact about the job search process:  It's not easy. 
 The process is littered with ups and downs, small victories, and brutal defeats. By the time you achieve the ultimate victory‚Äîearning your dream job‚Äîyou're both physically and emotionally exhausted. 
 As difficult as the process may be, the lessons that you learn from it will come in handy if you ever find yourself on the job market again. Some of those lessons may have actually caught you by surprise. Let's make the search process a little easier for others (or at least mentally prepare them) and tackle some of those surprises now. 
 Wow! There Are Many Ways To Find A Job 
 via GIPHY Wow! Is right. In a simpler time, a long time ago (in a galaxy far, far away), one would just read the classifieds section of the newspaper to see what was available for employment. Today, while the classifieds still exist (they're online) there are a large amount of online job websites that specialize in job searches from all over the country and world. Websites like Indeed, Monster, Glassdoor, LinkedIn, and Craigslist are some of the most well-known job boards but there are many others, including some that may be tailored for individual states, regions, and professions. The amount of choices can be very overwhelming, especially if you haven't been involved in a job search recently. The best thing to do is explore multiple websites to see which ones align best with your needs. Also, seek counsel from friends and colleagues who have been through the process to hear about their experiences with the various websites. While these websites are a good resource for seeing what's available for jobs, it's important to not over-rely on them. If you've identified some companies you want to work for, conduct a  proactive job search  and make personal connections via networking.  Don't rely solely on the online job board to express interest and to submit your application. 
 There Are A Lot Of Ways To Write A Resume 
 You haven't updated your resume in a while and want to see what the latest formats look like, so you type "resume format" or "resume template" into your online search engine. All of a sudden, you're presented with another overwhelming amount of choices. Seeking resume guidance online is like trying to self-diagnose yourself by using a medical website‚Äîyou sometimes get more than you bargained for. When working on your resume, it's important to initially focus more on the content, which will eventually allow the format to fall into place.   It's also important to realize that there isn't a "one-size-fits-all" resume, as each resume should be tailored to the job for which you're applying . You want to make sure that your relevant skills and accomplishments that would translate to this new job are at the top of the resume. A recruiter should be able to see these transferable skills within the first six seconds of reviewing your resume. Work It Daily has  multiple resume resources , including a  resume review by our career coaches. 
 The Thought Of Personal Branding May Make You Panic 
 Resumes and cover letters are not enough anymore. At Work It Daily, we like to say that you're a "business-of-one," and personal branding is a big part of that. Personal branding may seem overwhelming if you've never thought about it before, but it's really not that bad. Think back to when you were preparing your resume. Think about what type of career you're seeking and think about the type of skills that you have that translate into that industry. Think about what really makes you stand out. Once you've determined this, share it with the world.  Use LinkedIn and social media to your advantage. Your goal is to let people know what you're up to professionally at all times. That way your professional network will be aware of what your professional brand is, which could turn into referrals whenever you're on the job market. If you worry that you lack a personal branding strategy, don't panic. Take your time, put some thought into it, and consult with colleagues and mentors. Everyone has a personal brand, it's just a matter of putting everything together and executing it. 
 There's More Than One Way To Do A Job Interview 
 Phone, video, and group interviews are all becoming more common. No matter what type of interview you're a part of,  the key is always preparation . Treat every interview the same way. Prepare answers to all the  common interview questions  the interviewer could ask and do your research on the company before the interview. Prepare questions for the interviewer so they know that you're interested and have done your research. Also, be sure to dress professionally (more on that in a minute). Most people are familiar with the in-person interview and, while it can be nerve-racking, it's also familiar. There's comfort and familiarity.  It's those interview styles you're not as familiar with that can be the most intimidating to prepare for. Of all these interview styles, you'll most likely experience the  phone interview , where you're interviewing just for the chance to be invited to an in-person interview. That in itself is a lot of pressure, but when you're doing a phone interview you also lose the advantage of certain social cues. During an in-person interview, you're able to make eye contact with the interviewer and are better able to convey enthusiasm and emphasis. You're also able to look at the interviewer and can attempt to gauge their reactions. Phone interviews also move a lot quicker than in-person interviews, you get less time to get your points across. Even though all interviews carry with them some level of stress, the condensed timeline and impersonal nature of the phone screen makes it one of the trickiest interviews to go through.  
 You'll Obsess Over What To Wear To Your In-Person Interview 
 It's true, you will... and that's okay! You want to dress for success and the interview is your chance to make a  first impression . Deciding how to dress goes back to your company research. You want to determine what the company's culture is and then dress one step above it. For example, if the company is very casual, show up to the interview in business casual attire. You may already have the perfect outfit or you may spend some time in front of the mirror changing outfits. It's okay to be picky, just as long as the outfit you choose matches the company culture. Make sure your shirts are ironed and shoes are clean. And, if you bought new clothes for the interview, make sure you got all the tags off. 
 You Can Have A Great Interview And Still Not Get The Job 
 There are times where you may know immediately that you didn't get the job. You weren't as prepared as you needed to be or the position just wasn't a good fit. While no one wants to have a bad interview, sometimes it's easier to mentally accept, particularly if you're able to pinpoint where it went wrong and apply the lessons moving forward. But, what if you did everything right? What if you left the interview feeling like you crushed it and that the job was in the bag, only to later learn that you didn't get the job? It could be that you did in fact have a very awesome interview, but the mistake that you made was assuming that you would automatically get the job because of it. When employers say they had many qualified candidates apply for the job, it's not just lip service. Chances are they had a tough choice to make and while you gave it a good effort, there was just another candidate that was a better fit for the position. It can be a major blow the first time this happens to you. Let it humble you but don't let it deter you.  Build on the things  you did well and do an honest self-assessment and fine tune the things that you can do better. Make sure to thank the interviewer for the opportunity and continue to express interest in the position. There's always a chance they could come back to you at some point in the future. 
 Salary Is Important But May Not Be Everything 
 A lot of people change jobs to get a better salary, while many others do so because they're not happy in their current career. Whatever the reason, salary still remains a crucial component. It's important to  do your research  on the average salary for the type of position you're pursuing in your geographical area. However, as you go through the job search process, your stance on salary may change. You may like a company's work-life balance and benefits package so much that you're willing to take a cut in salary. There may also be cases where the demands of a job are more than anticipated and you need to up your salary requirements. Individual circumstances also play a major role in salary negotiations. When it's time to negotiate salary, be flexible. Don't short-change yourself but also understand your priorities. Salary is an important part of the equation but you also need to factor in everything you've learned about this position during the search process to make a well-informed decision. One thing is for certain when it comes to the job search process‚Äîyou learn a lot along the way! Work It Daily can help you in your journey to your dream job.

  3 Simple Mistakes That Will Ruin Your Cover Letter  
 Aaron Sanborn 
 August 25, 2020 
   
 Finding a job isn't a simple task in normal circumstances. Add in an ultra-competitive job market and there's no margin for error. 
 For job seekers, an underwhelming cover letter is one of the major factors preventing them from moving forward in the job search process, and it's the smallest errors that can get your cover letter thrown out. 
 Cover letters are extremely important to securing a job interview. If you continue to make the same mistakes over and over again, you may never hear back about the job opportunities that you desire. Recruiters go through hundreds of cover letters and know exactly what they're looking for. If your cover letter has these simple mistakes, it will get tossed. 
 A Lazy Greeting 
 Don't start your cover letter with "To Whom It May Concern." This phrase is impersonal, old-fashioned, and incredibly lazy. For one, job seekers should be able to track down the company's hiring manager or lead recruiter via the company's website or LinkedIn page. (Many LinkedIn postings contain the profile of the recruiter posting the opening.) In cases where you can't find a name, use "Dear hiring team." It's a lot more personal. 
 Too Much Bragging 
 If the majority of your cover letter is focused on how great you are, then you have a problem. Many job seekers will take up space in their cover letter with empty statements like, "I'm a self-starter and a great team player." Not only should such statements be quantified, but there's really no room for such self-promotion in the cover letter. Instead, the cover letter should focus on how you understand the company you're applying to and its mission, and how you personally connect to that mission.  You need to make a personal connection, and show how you'll be able to fit into the company and its culture. You can sell your skills in  your resume , and if you land an interview, you'll have an additional opportunity to sell yourself as a strong employee. 
 Treating Your Cover Letter Like A Resume 
 A cover letter is an entirely different document than a resume! This point can't be stressed enough.  A recruiter will not waste their time looking at two documents that are virtually identical. A resume captures your work history, skill sets, and accomplishments, while a cover letter is your opportunity to express interest in the job and make a connection with the company. The best way to do this is with a  disruptive cover , in which you grab the recruiter's attention from the start by sharing a personal story about how you connect with the company, or position, you're applying to. Explain what you admire about the company you're applying to. Do they sell a product or provide a service that's had a big impact on your life? Do they support causes you are passionate about? Why do you feel connected to their mission? Once you draw the recruiter in, you can slowly begin to explain why you'd fit into that company's culture. Here are some great,  FREE examples  of the proper way to write a cover letter! Looking for an additional boost? Work It Daily can help!

  4 Reasons Why Writing A Cover Letter DOESN'T Have To Be Difficult  
 Aaron Sanborn 
 July 23, 2020 
   
 Writing a good cover letter is one of the most crucial parts of the job search process. Without a good cover letter, you won't even score a job interview. 
 Because of the pressure associated with writing the cover letter, some people dread writing them. However, with the right attitude, writing a cover letter can actually be enjoyable. 
 Instead of thinking of a cover letter as something that you HAVE to do, consider it an opportunity.  Opportunities are exciting and contain endless possibilities. Your cover letter is an opportunity to show a potential employer how you would fit into the company. Here's how you take this opportunity and run with it! 
 If You're Applying For The Right Job, Writing A Cover Letter Should Be Easy 
 via GIPHY If you truly want the position you're applying for, understand the position, and do your  research about the company,  then writing a cover letter shouldn't be too difficult. When you're excited and pumped up about something, it's usually pretty fun to share that excitement with others, and explain how that excitement came to be. In some ways, writing a cover letter is like having a conversation. When you know a lot about a particular topic of conversation, you're able to continually contribute to it and keep it going. If you're applying for a job that you're excited about, you should easily be able to give multiple examples of why the job appeals to you, and why you would be a good fit for it. If you're struggling to convey interest for the job and how you would be a good fit, it's very possible that you're applying to the job for the wrong reasons or don't really understand the job you're applying for. How easy, or difficult, the cover letter is to write says a lot about whether you're pursuing the right opportunity. If the job is a good fit, you'll welcome the opportunity to write the cover letter. 
 This Is Your Opportunity To Be Disruptive 
 How often in life are you actually encouraged to be disruptive?  Writing a cover letter gives you a chance to do just that. A  disruptive cover letter  is a cover letter that gets an emotional reaction from the recruiter. The response is so strong that the recruiter is more focused on the person than the piece of paper. The best way to generate this type of response is by sharing a story about why you feel a personal connection to the company that you're applying to. It could be a personal life experience that you feel connects you with the company's brand, or a story about a personal experience you had with the company and how it molded your professional goals. By capturing the recruiter's heart and mind, you'll create a connection with them that will give you an edge in securing a job interview. 
 Just Remember To Avoid These Cover Letter Mistakes 
 To ensure that your disruptive cover letter has the desired effect, make sure you proofread multiple times to avoid grammatical errors. It may be a good idea to have a friend or trusted mentor give the letter a read for both grammar and content.  An additional set of eyes is never a bad idea. It's also important to make sure the cover letter doesn't mirror your resume. In addition to making a personal connection, you can use your cover letter to give specific examples of why you  fit the position , but it should be unique from what is already on your resume. Make sure you don't use the same cover letter for applying to different jobs. Each cover letter should be unique to the position and company that you're applying for. You'll also want to personalize the cover letter. Do some research about who will be receiving the cover letter. It's usually best to avoid the phrase "to whom it may be concerned."  
 Writing A Good Cover Letter Can Lead To New Opportunities 
 It's possible to write a good cover letter, get a job interview or two, not get the job, and still win! If you were able to secure multiple interviews with a company that means you were a strong candidate. There was just another candidate who may have been a better fit at that time. Thank the company for the opportunity, ask them to keep you in mind for future opportunities, and keep in touch. Writing a strong cover letter got you in the door and on the company's radar. As a result, you made some new connections within your desired industry.  Be excited about this!
