 ESPNW: Shea Holbrook's Cool Sports Job - Race Car Driver 
 By  SRO Motorsports America Staff May 5, 2016 TC Class ,  Team News 
 __No Comments 
 Shea Holbrook can say something a lot of people can't: She loves her job. Once an elite competitive water skier, Holbrook made the unusual crossover to auto racing at age 16. She has since become a six-race winner in road racing's Pirelli World Challenge Touring Car class and a team owner, running Shea Racing with her parents, Jeff and Erin Holbrook, from a 1,200-square-foot shop next to their rural Groveland, Florida, home. 
 Now 26, Shea has a bachelor's degree from the University of Central Florida in interpersonal and organizational communication, with a minor in marketing, and she's a driver coach for the Sports Car Club of America's Track Night America, a program that gives everyday drivers in regular cars access to race circuits across the country. 
 Shea spoke about her career path recently with espnW.
