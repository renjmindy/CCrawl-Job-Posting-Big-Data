 3d lighting, shading and rendering in Maya/Arnold 
 Published: Last month  Deadline: 3 Bids: 4 
 Hello, I have modeled a baseball stadium but I need to do a good lighting, shaders and rendering. 
Many objects are already textured, others need to be textured with designs that I will provide, for the lighting maybe you can use a physical sky for the exteriors and finally I will need the maya project to be able to render it on my own. 
I have attached a pdf of a quick montage that I did in photoshop of how it should look, obviously with better lighting and render. 
 I will provide all the Maya project. 
My budged for this project is $45. 
 Regards,
