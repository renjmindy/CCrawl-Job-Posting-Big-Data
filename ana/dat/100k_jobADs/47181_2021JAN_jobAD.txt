 Are you an expert in driving operational performance through engagement and leadership? Are you looking for an autonomous management role, with significant opportunity for further advancement? 
 I'm recruiting a Site Director for a high-volume manufacturer based in Bedford, for a site with an interesting story - profitable, well-invested but lacking an inspirational leader to maximise performance. You will work closely with the Divisional Managing Director to transform the feeling of the site from negative and concerned, to positive and energised, providing a platform for productivity and future growth. 
 You will be a proven Site Director, Site Manager or Operations Director, with a track record delivering improvements in culture, productivity and efficiency within a fast-paced manufacturing environment. You understand the impact of leadership on culture, and the impact of culture on processes - you aspire to get the best out of your people by creating the right working environment for them to thrive, and implementing effective processes for maximum success across the site. 
 This global organisation has demonstrated consistent profitability in a highly competitive market, underpinned by an acute understanding of customer requirements and the provision of a rounded supply chain service, not simply a product. The culture is accountable, fast-paced and innovative, and has a clear focus on sustainability. Throughout the pandemic they have operated sites in a safe manner, with certain sites seeing a huge uplift in volumes, the Bedford site included. 
 The successful candidate will be paid approximately £85,000 plus benefits including car allowance, bonus, private healthcare and pension. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
