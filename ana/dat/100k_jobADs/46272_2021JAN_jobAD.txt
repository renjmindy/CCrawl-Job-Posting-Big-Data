 AIGA's "How to Find Your First Job" by Juliette Cezzar 
 As I am about to become an alum in a few short weeks I decided to read the article,  How to Find Your First Job , from the AIGA website to help me decide whether I want to look for a job or apply to graduate school after I graduate. Graduating is something that has become utterly terrifying to me because, let's face it, who really wants college to end? 
 Once I started reading the article I realized that part of this process was familiar to me already because last spring I applied to internships, which basically is very similar up until the "accepting a job" section. Yes, I did accept my internship position, but I did not have to think about things like the amount of vacation/sick time, work-related travel, etc. Until the article had mentioned it I hadn't given much thought to that aspect of accepting a position. I was even surprised to read that the author suggested negotiating your offer. I'm not exactly sure I would be comfortable doing that for my first job. 
 I think this article was pretty good about the specific steps involved in relatively general way for searching for jobs. I didn't feel as though it offered any ground-breaking new way for applying for jobs that I haven't already read about before. The exception being that the manner of organization and concise information made the reading smooth and digestible for someone like myself who doesn't love to read.
