 EXPAT? LOOKING FOR A JOB AFTER STUDY, PROMOTION OR RESEARCH? 
 THE ORIENTATION YEAR MAY BE THE PERFECT SOLUTION 
 **Completed an accredited bachelor 's or master's program in our country? And looking for a job or help with starting you own business? The Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND) of the Ministry of Justice and Security offers you a great opportunity:  the orientation year . With this permit graduated bachelor and master students, PhD's and postdocs earn a one year right of residence in the Netherlands. ** 
 Have you completed various study programmes or doctoral programmes, or have you performed various scientific researches in the Netherlands or at a top-200 university abroad? The orientation year can be granted after each completed study programme or doctoral programme or after each performed scientific research. 
 7000 companies to choose from 
 With a resident permit you can choose whatever work you like. And another good thing: you can apply for the arrangement until three years after graduation. Even multiple times. If you finish a second study or research project you are allowed to apply for an orientation year again if the last study or research differs from earlier ones. 
 The orientation year was introduced by the Dutch government about nine years ago as a means to attract and hold foreign students. It is not only a great means for foreign graduates to enter the Dutch labour market but also is a benefit to Dutch companies. In the Netherlands the IND has allowed about 7000 companies to hire highly skilled knowledge migrants. 
 Sending an application for an orientation year to the IND costs € 285. Like to know more about the conditions for a residence permit for your orientation year?  You can visit a special website of the IND here.
