 Heckuva Job, Dukie! 
 From  abcNEWS  : 
 
 President  Donald Trump  pledged to help Puerto Ricans recover basic necessities and security in Maria's ruinous aftermath as his homeland security chief tried to escape a tempest of her own making, set off when she called Washington's response to the hurricane a "good-news story." 
 Elaine Duke, the department's acting secretary, drew a sharp rebuke from San Juan's mayor for seeming to play down the suffering. 
 "When you don't have food for a baby, it's not a good-news story," Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz told CNN on Friday. "Damn it, this is not a good-news story. This is a people-are-dying story."

 Trump said he was not aware of Duke's remark. 
 "I haven't heard what she said," he told reporters. "I can tell you this: We have done an incredible job considering there's absolutely nothing to work with." 
 Yet even in voicing solidarity and sympathy with Puerto Rico, he drew attention again to the island's pre-hurricane debt burden and infrastructure woes, leaving doubt how far Washington will go to make the U.S. territory whole. 
 â€¦snipâ€¦ 
 Earlier he tweeted: "The fact is that Puerto Rico has been destroyed by two hurricanes. Big decisions will have to be made as to the cost of its rebuilding!" 
 Duke visited the island Friday, surveying the ravaged landscape by helicopter in an hourlong tour and driving from the airport past still-flooded streets, twisted billboards and roofs with gaping holes. She met local officials and federal personnel on the ground, and tried to move on from remarks that stunned people in Puerto Rico a day earlier. 
 â€¦snipâ€¦ 
 During this season's trio of monster hurricanes â€” Harvey, Irma, Maria â€” Trump and his administration have drifted into the perilous territory of premature self-congratulation in the face of unfolding catastrophe, seemingly unmindful of the "Brownie moment" that scarred George W. Bush's presidency. 
 Bush famously told his emergency management director, Michael Brown, "Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job" during what proved to be a tragically inept federal response to deadly  Hurricane Katrina  in 2005. 
 Trump has repeatedly boasted about the positive reviews he said his administration is getting from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands for its relief effort, even as people in remote towns struggle to find food, water and other basics. Then Duke said before leaving Washington that the federal relief effort was a "good-news story" because of "our ability to reach people and the limited number of deaths." 
 "Let me clarify," she said Friday upon her arrival in San Juan. She said she meant "it was good news that people of Puerto Rico and many public servants of the United States are working together."

 Ugh, ugh, ugh. I'm seriously praying that the Big One doesn't hit the West Coast during King Trump's term. Considering how callous and heartless he is, he'll probably just say we brought it on ourselves by voting for Hillary and ignore us.

 He's such a narcissistic asshole. He thinks even hurricanes is all about him. I was gone almost all day, and I am watching AM Joy now, and I see that Twitler had to take some shots at the mayor of San Juan on Twitter. He really can't stand strong women.

 Yep good ole Dukie is piece of work, just like her boss. This is what happens when wealthy folks with no political expertise are given a job when they are vastly unqualified. None of them can identify with the poor and or reality of folks and situations in need. 
 It's more than pitiful when they attempt to back track on their stupid statements.

 When they try to backtrack, it just makes their original comments sound even worse. It's because they don't know how to backtrack. They just make believe they didn't say something incredibly insensitive and stupid instead of apologizing for their stupidity. I don't think Dukie is a stupid woman, and maybe she is not as unsympathetic as she sounded. I suspect that she was under orders to give Twitler's response a glowing report, just like all the Cabinet members are required to do.

 That one comes up whenever I look for an emoji. Guess that's just a reflection of my life.
