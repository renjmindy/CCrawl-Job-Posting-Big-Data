 A great opening has become available with a sheet metal products manufacturer, (Dudley area) for someone who prides themselves on liaising successfully with customers in order to deliver the best results for their own bespoke projects. 
 Working for a business who are constantly investing in new machinery and technology, you will take a continuous improvement approach managing unique projects throughout the design process to ensure completion according to deadlines and schedules. 
 Working with a diverse product range that is distributed to all manner of working environments from harsh marine environments to more polished, close knit manufacturing engineering businesses, you will need to be able to adapt to the necessary compliance and quality standards required. Working cross functionally with sales, procurement and production teams will be key as you drive projects forward - maintaining a high-quality standard and a continued focus on finding ways to continually improve on the design and manufacturing process. An emphasis on involvement with New Product Development will also play a key part in this role. 
 Proficiency with Solidworks software is preferable as is previous experience in sheet metal manufacturing in either a manufacturing, industrial, construction, agricultural, power generation or related industry.
