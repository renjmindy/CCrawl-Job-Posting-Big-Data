 Relationships over Resources

 A member of this congregation sent me an email including a list of short phrases called paraprosdokians. 
 A paraprosdokian, according to my online dictionary, is a derivative of a Greek word which means, 'beyond expectation'. It is a wordplay, a figure of speech in which the latter part of a sentence is unexpected. Here's a smattering: 
 · A neighbour knocked on my door and asked for a small donation towards the local swimming pool, so I gave him a glass of water. 
 · Take my advice — I'm not using it. 
 · Ever stop to think, and forget to start again? 
 · He who laughs last, thinks slowest. 
 · I was going to give him a nasty look, but he already had one. 
 · Change is inevitable, except from a vending machine. 
 · I was going to wear my camouflage shirt today, but I couldn't find it. 
 · If at first you don't succeed, skydiving is not for you. 
 · No matter how much you push the envelope, it'll still be stationery. 
 · Money is the root of all … wealth. 
 Indeed, the Gospel today (Luke 16:1-13) has at least one major, unexpected twist. And unlike most of these paraprosdokians, this twist is not humorous. 
 A manager has been wasteful of his boss' riches, and consequently will lose his job. So, the manager figures on a scheme to look out for his own interests in his impending unemployment. The 'dishonest manager' -- as some bibles entitle this parable -- puts himself first at the seeming expense of his boss: he will go to his boss' debtors and demand only half of what they owe. He shrewdly seeks to curry favour with them, and anticipates to be in their good books, once he is unemployed. 
 Smart move, you might say, eh? But what will Jesus say? Especially keeping in mind that this passage comes to us on the heels of the 'golden' chapter of the bible, Luke 15. Therein we read the familiar and heart-warming stories of the lost being found, of celebration and belonging, of unimaginable grace and mercy shown to the poor, the wayward, those who are not easily counted in the economy of the day. 
 In Luke 15, we get the strong impression that the values of God's kingdom -- mercy, inclusion of others, unconditional love -- stand in sharp contrast to the values of the world -- competition, self-centredness, individualism. And, now, in Luke 16, the set up leads me to anticipate Jesus will come down hard on the 'dishonest' manager. I expect Jesus to say how unjust, unethical, and selfish the manager was. Don't be as self-centred as he is! 
 In verse eight, the rug is pulled out from underneath me: "And his master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly." What ?!!  Commended ? 
 And yet, I should expect that the bible does that to us from time to time. The bible does not present a tightly knit, unequivocally clear and coherent storyline. You can justify anything from the bible, if you want -- even murder. But that is not what we are about, when we approach the bible. 
 After all, there is an important reason why the New Testament includes four, different, renditions of the life and times of Jesus. If uniformity was the goal in the inspiration behind putting together the bible, then we would have only had one Gospel, not four. Matthew, Mark, Luke and John -- the first four books of the New Testament -- basically follow a similar plot line about Jesus' birth, baptism, calling, choosing disciples, healing, teaching, passion, death and resurrection stories. 
 And yet, each presents variations, slightly different orders, and yes, sometimes even these unexpected twists and turns in what needs to be emphasized. There are, after all, different people listening in -- the religious leaders of the day, his disciples -- people like you and me who live different lives and face different challenges. Each of us needs to hear something unique to what our needs are, apart from our neighbour. And each faith community needs to hear a unique word spoken to them. 
 So, while the story of the dishonest manager twists and puts our expectations on their head, perhaps there is something here worth paying attention to. "You cannot serve God and wealth" concludes the passage. And yet, the manager was looking out for his own material well-being in his shrewd and commendable actions. 
 Well, what is the wealth that is talked about here? For what treasure do we Christians -- called the "children of the light" in this text (v.8) -- search? What is the golden nugget that we seek, above all else? Again, perhaps the broader context can help us, again. 
 As I said, the previous stories of the lost sheep, lost coin and lost sons suggest that what is valuable in the economy of God, stands in sharp contrast to what is valuable in the economy of the world. These are treasures that are worth uprooting what is hidden, putting in the light what is shrouded in darkness, lifting up what is normally considered not worth the effort, forgiving what is unforgivable. 
 What does the shrewd manager value, even more than making money? He values relationships. He values keeping connected with others even though he loses what the world values -- jobs, financial security and material wealth: 
 He reduces the amount of debt owed by the amount of his commission -- as some biblical commentators suggest. He reduces the amount of interest owed, according to the Torah Law in Deuteronomy 23:19-20 -- as other commentators suggest. Regardless of how we interpret the manager's actions, we can see how much the manager values being in relationship, above all else. 
 The wealth described here is the treasure of being inter-related in a season of loss and disruptive change. Relationships over Resources, you could say (1). 
 And this truth hits us unexpectedly in the telling of the Gospel. Another classic reversal. I started this sermon with a Greek word to describe a form of speech that ends unexpectedly. Of course, the New Testament was written in Greek and influenced by Greek culture. 
 Greek culture often reflects this image of having a feast in the midst of famine. Another contrast of expectations, when during a famine you would not expect people to throw a large feast, and celebrate. Remember, after finding the lost sheep, the lost coin and when the Prodigal returns home, there is much rejoicing. And a feast is prepared for the whole community. 
 This does not make sense. To have a feast in the midst of famine. And yet, this is what we are called to do. To be children of the light, in the midst of darkness. Not to be a slave to our circumstances and meagre resources, as we may see them to be. But to release them, distribute them, relinquish our seeming control over them, all for the purpose of maintaining and strengthening our relationships. 
 Celebrating the gift of each other and those we meet. Relationships first, then resources. The horse before the cart, not the other way around. 
 We may by lying in the gutter of our lives, but we keep our gazed fixed upon the stars. We may be wallowing in an ocean of despair, regret, fear or pain -- but we begin with a spoonful of water. In other words, there is always hope. There is always room to grow, to change, to something -- anything -- in order to make things better. This is the quality of faith. 
 We are never lost, abandoned and left for dead in the economy of God's grace. After all, the rich man gives his irresponsible manager a second chance. Normally when charges are brought against an employee, charges that incriminate and prove wrong-doing to the degree of 'squandering' the owner's property, the person in question is fired immediately, without question. 
 But something odd happens here: The rich man allows his soon-to-be-fired worker to continue doing his job for a while. The rich man gives his delinquent employee some ground, some space, to do something -- anything -- in order to make things better. The rich man demonstrates some grace in a relationship that has gone awry. 
 Not only are the relationships in life our priority over everything else including our material resources, the quality of those relationships -- according to the New Testament -- are defined by grace, compassion, and love. 
 An unexpected twist of the stories of our lives in the world, perhaps. Yet, these are the hallmarks of the children of light following Christ in the world. 
 Thanks be to God!
