 HAWKIE! Drawn to Politics - my curating job 
   
   
   
   
   
   
 This was a 'labour' of love acting as curator for this recent cartoon exhibition at Hotel Kurrajong, Barton, ACT. The exhibition went from 30 Nov to 15 Dec and featured 75 high quality prints of cartoons and caricatures from this nation's best black and white artists from four decades. The show focussed on the political life of Bob Hawke. 
 At the time of our famous ex-PM's passing earlier this year, I noticed many artists posting their drawings of Bob on social media. I thought 'there is an exhibition here'. The show was supported by the Australian Cartoonists Association (ACA) and a venue was sourced. I then took over and went about sourcing the images, finding a sponsor and organising the opening. HAWKES Brewing came on board as 'liquid' sponsor which was great. 
 OFFICIAL OPENING 
 I put a shout out to Hawkie's ex-cabinet colleagues: Graham 'Richo' Richardson and Gareth Evans. Both gentlemen accepted the invitation and gave wonderful speeches at the official opening on Thur 5 Dec. Bob's widow, Blanche deAlpuget, thought the idea was wonderful, although could not attend the opening. 
 Further to this was an auction held at the ACA's industry awards - The Stanleys - and all proceeds went to Landcare Australia.
