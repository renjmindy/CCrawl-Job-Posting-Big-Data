 Enough Dreaming: 8 Steps That Will Get You Closer To Career Goal 
 September 15, 2017  Business   0 
 
 Managing your career seems like a full time job by itself, but if you want to be successful, you need to look at it that way. Reaching the point of success is very important if that is something that means a lot to you. I suppose many people just give up after a while if things are not happening fast enough. You need to realize that all that happens for good takes a little hard work and some time. Here are 8 steps that will help you achieve your career goals faster. 
 
 Have clear goals 
 
 Before you can start working on achieving anything, you need to know what those are. Your goal can not simply be that you want to achieve career success. Make sure that you go a bit more in detail about what your end goal is. At  which company do you  want to work at or what earning power are you looking for? These are very important questions and following that, you can move closer to your goals. 
 
 Smaller achievable goals 
 
 So now that you know what your end goal is, you want to create a list of smaller achievable goals. These goals should be achieved in a short amount of time, to motivate you. Let’s say you want to be a professional biography writer, but you are just starting out. Getting your first client could be an achievable goal. You start with one and build from there. 
 
 Network 
 
 Having individuals in your life that are influences in the industry you are in, is very important. You never know who is going to open doors for you in the future. Go to industry events or connect with some of them online. As long as you start networking with those who can help you in the future, you are heading in the right direction. 
 
 Professional image 
 
 It does not matter which industry you are working in, a  professional image  is crucial. We do not want to be judged by the way we look, but unfortunately we are. I am not saying that you should be in a suit and tie when you are a construction worker. Just make sure that your appearance is neat and adhere to the company’s dress code. 
 
 Mind-set 
 
 Although hard work can take you places, it is going to be fruitless if you do not have a positive mind-set. If you are looking at an example of a bio and you believe that you would never produce something so amazing, you lost the battle already. Believe in yourself. 
 
 Do the work 
 
 If you want to reach goals that not many have, you are going to have to put in the work. Success does not come easy and it definitely does not happen overnight. It takes time and commitment. 
 
 Growth 
 
 While you are working on achieving your career goals, you want to  increase your knowledge and skills levels . Taking an extra class or course is only going to make your resume more attractive. Never stop learning. 
 
 Decrease the pressure 
 
 Do not be too hard on yourself. If you want to be a bio writer, it might take a little while. Stressing yourself out about not getting to your end goal in the time-frame you set, does not amount to failure. It just means that you are not ready yet and when you are ready, you will get there.
