 Career Coaching

 Roberta Gamza 
 Location:  Louisville, CO 
 How will clients benefit with you as their coach? 
 They’ll gain clarity of their goals, their challenges, and the path to attain their goals. 
 What results have clients reported after working with you? 
 Clients have reported getting the results they were after without exception, whether it was a promotion, new job, salary increase, expansion of responsibilities, or even relocating their job to another state. 
 What do clients say about working with you? 
 Clients remark on how easy it is to work with me, how valuable the sessions are, and how they can count on me to give them honest feedback. 
 What are 5 strengths you have as a coach? 
 
 
 I’m passionate about what I do and am very approachable. 
 
 
 I have extensive corporate experience and a strong and broad knowledge base. 
 
 
 I’m highly communicative and will clearly explain my ideas, expectations, and instructions. 
 
 
 I remain curious and inquisitive; I continue to learn and update my skills and knowledge. 
 
 
 I am disciplined and dependable; you can count on me to meet my commitments and to follow through. 
 
 
 What is your coaching philosophy? 
 I am a guide helping my clients who are embarking on a journey. My job is to help them open their minds to the infinite possibilities that are available to them. I encourage them to explore and ultimately remove the barriers that block their success. And I create a relaxed environment that is conducive to open communications, learning and development, and building confidence. 
 What types of people do you typically coach? 
 My typical coaching clients are looking to advance their careers, change careers or industries, or in many cases they want to influence changes in their current organization and need to build a compelling argument for the change. 
 What is your professional background? 
 I have been a social worker for the State of New Jersey, a high tech marketing professional, and now a professional resume writer and career coach. Like many of my clients, I am no stranger to successful career transitions. Before starting Career Ink, I enjoyed a successful 15-year marketing career with Hewlett-Packard where I created 2 jobs from scratch, earned 5 promotions, and was recognized 4 times for outstanding contributions. Career Ink is my third career transition and leverages my strong marketing background, persuasive communications skills, and keen problem solving abilities.
