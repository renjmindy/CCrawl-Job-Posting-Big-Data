 I am a 49 yr old catholic woman from India, a graduate, who has applied for immigration to canada some years back. I am awaiting my medicals request. I have not done a professional course in child/geriatric care but have the experience to do both. I have cared for my young nephew from the time he was born till a year old. Now he and his younger sister visit often and many times consider me their mother. They can vouch for me. I am currently taking care of my mother who is 79 years old and who is suffering from a number of ailments. My late father was also ailing till he died at the age of 77. I am very confident of handling either a nanny post or geriatric care. 
 I would like to know if i stand a chance for a job in canada. character verification will be made available. In any case police clearance has already been submitted for immigration purpose. 
 I look forward to hearing from you. 
 Regards, 
Patricia.
