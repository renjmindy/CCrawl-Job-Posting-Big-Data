 Tara Castagna 
 GLOBAL ADVERTISING SALES MANAGER 
 What you love about WordStream: 
 WordStream has given me the opportunity to work with Business Owners all over the world and help them increase their revenue from paid search advertising. Knowing I can help people save money and make more provides instant gratification, and is one of the many reasons I love what I do here. 
 Favorite Food: 
 Bacon 100% 
 Funny Fact: 
 On my second day of work at WordStream my dad showed up unexpectedly to “make sure the place was real”. I was humiliated.

 SOFTWARE ENGINEER 
 What you love about WordStream 
 I love the fact that I can crack a joke or share a crazy business idea with the rest of my team. Or if I don’t feel up to it that day, I can put my headphones on and write code with no distraction. Our teams are small, collaborative and flexible which allows me to work when, where and how I need. 
 Funny Fact: 
 Official Red Bull long distance paper wings champion 
 Favorite thing to do in Boston: 
 Exercising near the Charles river during the fall when we get that month of incredible scary looking sunsets 
 Maurice Camara 
 IMPLEMENTATION SPECIALIST 
 What you love about WordStream: 
 WordStream is a rare example of a company that truly stands by its core values. We love what we do, and it shows in our results. I personally get immense satisfaction from helping business owners properly track conversions. The camaraderie I share with my colleagues is one of the many reasons why I can’t wait to get in the office, as well as the can-do attitude that fills the air. 
 Funny Fact: 
 My favorite icebreaker when I started at WordStream was showcasing card tricks I learned. 
 Favorite Food: 
 My favorite food is definitely Dibisogo. It’s roasted meat seasoned with secret spices made in Mali, which is where I grew up. I could sell my soul for some. :-)
