 Post-doctoral Fellow position in Emerging Technologies for Polarization Scramblers and Mode Converters 
 
 Carleton University (Ottawa, Canada), Viavi Solutions 
 The Carleton Optical Innovation Lab at Carleton University, in collaboration with Viavi Solutions, has an opening for Postdoctoral Fellow beginning January 1st, 2021 (or as soon as a qualified candidate is found). 
 The project focuses on both polarization scrambling and mode conversion technologies, which Viavi has identified as priority domains for improvement in their optical component products. We seek to study the use of fiber Bragg gratings devices for modes conversion and emerging materials such as high Verdet constant glasses for applications in Polarization scrambling. 
 The post-doctoral fellow (PDF) is expected to play a leading role in the project as they will be responsible for carrying out all theoretical and experimental investigations. The PDF will report regularly to researchers at Carleton and Viavi and will be responsible for providing a report of their findings at the conclusion of their project (in addition to any publishable findings). 
 The position is for one year at a salary of $47-$50K CAD (depending on optional benefits). The fellow will be based at Carleton University initially but will likely spend some time at Viavi in Ottawa. 
 Interested candidates should send a Curriculum Vitae, plus a full list of publications and other measures of output, as well as the names and contact information for at least 3 references. We welcome those that would contribute to the further diversification of our university and encourage those in underrepresented groups in engineering to apply. A condition for eligibility is that applicants must have earned their first PhD within the last three years. 
 All applications should be via email to: Christopher.Smelser@carleton.ca (or through coilgroup.ca). The position will remain open until staffed.
