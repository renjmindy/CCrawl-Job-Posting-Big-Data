 Portable jobsite tablesaws are larger than benchtop saws, but still a small size for portability. They typically are used on top of a folding stand and are very useful to have on location. If you are a woodworker of some kind, you will probably want to have one on hand. 
 A portable jobsite tablesaw would most commonly be used by carpenters or contractors. They cost less than benchtop saws, making them a popular option. They are designed to be lighter than them as well, to make it much easier to carry from place to place. 
 When it comes to the best portable job site saws, you want to be sure that you are getting something durable. These tools have to do a lot of hard work, so you need to be sure the model you purchase is up to the task. 
 If you are looking for the perfect table saw, you might feel overwhelmed. There are so many different options on the market today- how can you know what to pick? Well, we included everything you need to know in this guide! 
 Be sure to continue reading to find the best portable table saw for you. 
 __The RPM 
 The RPM refers to the rotations per minute that your saw can achieve. When you are looking to buy a new one, this is an important feature to consider. The higher the RPM, the easier it is to cut through the material. Plus, you can make those cuts more accurate. 
 So, if you want smoother edges and cuts, you are going to want to look for products that feature the highest RPMs. On average, 4,500 RPM and above are going to be more than enough. 
 __Safety Features/Sensors 
 Safety sensors also feature that you want to keep an eye out for. These might be marked as “flesh sensors” or “skin sensors” on the product’s packaging. This crucial safety feature typically adds to the cost- but is worth it. 
 The sensors stop the saw from moving when it comes into contact with a person. Everything shuts down immediately. If this happened to you, you would likely still receive a cut, but the sensors stop the saw from causing you extreme harm. 
 Guards also prevent you from accidentally touching the blade. You will need a saw that has guards that do not get in your way, yet still provide you with protection. We recommend that you try to find a job site table saw with these safety features in place. 
 __A Powerful Motor 
 You will want your portable table saw to have a powerful motor. If it does not, your projects might not be cut accurately or you might notice the saw chugging as it tries to cut through your material. 
 A motor featuring 1 or 2 horsepower will be able to easily cut through wood that is 2 inches thick. If you have thicker materials you want to work with, be sure to consider a motor with 3 to 5 horsepower instead. 
 Overall, the motor will have an impact on how the tool runs. If you want to get accurate cuts with less effort, stronger motors are better. 
 The top 10 portable jobsite tablesaws 2021

 1. DEWALT (DWE7491RS) 10-Inch Table Saw 
   
 Key Features 
 
 Large work space 
 Built-in rolling stand 
 Built-in rack and fence 
 Site-Pro Guarding System 
 Long warranty 
 
 Our Rating

 ](https://amzn.to/3qey78L) 
 Our Take 
 This is the best job site table saw for a reason. It features 4,800 RPM, is easy to set up and take down, and has an impressive accuracy. It is simple to use and is easy enough to move around the location, although it is on the heavier side. 
 The 15-amp motor allows the saw to easily cut through most wood materials you will be using. The best feature though would have to be the built-in stand that comes with it. The stand is sturdy and prevents the table from shaking as you cut. 
 The wheels on the stand also make it much simpler to transport. If you needed to suddenly move your work location, you could just tilt the stand-up and wheel it off. No complicated folding or lifting is required. We appreciated this little feature quite a bit. 
 The safety features in place are alright but are nothing fantastic. Some shields prevent you from accidentally touching the saw, without making it harder to see the project. There do not seem to be flesh sensors, but the guards keep you away from the blades. Users enjoyed that it was easy to set up and get running.

 Our Rating 
 [Check Price 
 ](https://amzn.to/3qi9Z51) 
 Our Take 
 When it comes to the job site table saw comparison, this is another great contender for the best product. The Metabo HPT includes a powerful 15 amp motor that gives you the 4,500 RPM you need for making smooth and accurate cuts. 
 Users noted that the saw stops spinning quickly after being shut off and thought it was a good option overall. They also mentioned that they appreciated the portability of the saw and that the wheels it came with were durable- making it easy to move the saw wherever they needed it. 
 The saw is pretty much assembled out of the box. It includes a “soft start” function that stops the blade from picking up speed too quickly when you turn it on and even includes an electric brake that stops the saw almost instantly. 
 The saw cuts 3 ⅛ in deep when at 90 degrees and 2 ¼ in deep when cutting at 45 degrees. As for the safety features, it comes with an oversized safety switch that can be used for immediate shutdown. We think that this is an important addition to the product.

 ](https://amzn.to/2Js3pZ1) 
 Our Take 
 This compact machine packs quite a punch with a 5,800 RPM. It is light, weighing under 50 pounds, and cuts easily through soft materials. It is perfect for carpenters, but can not handle many kinds of metals. 
 Many people new to the world of woodworking mentioned that it was a great first saw to have and appreciated its reliability. They did have some issues with the 8 ¼ in the blade being a little too small and the wheelless base- but it still worked well overall and provided accurate controls. 
 DeWalt has been making quality power tools since 1923. They offer some great warranties you might want to check out and have wonderful customer service teams that feel like they are on your side. 
 The 15 amp motor is strong and the product includes a variety of safety features. They are a blade guard, and anti-kickback system, a blade brake, and adjustments you can make without additional tools. 
 The dust collection system is perfect for use with a shop vac and prevents sawdust from building up and getting in your way. Overall, we think that this saw is perfect for at-home DIY projects and smaller carpenter jobs.

 Our Rating 
 [Check Price 
 ](https://amzn.to/2Vk6HjB) 
 Our Take 
 This is a much more cost-effective option if you have a stricter budget that you need to follow. The saw is pretty light, weighing 46 pounds. It can also achieve 5,000 RPM, making it perfect for many different types of projects. If you do a lot of work with wooden boards, we think it would be a nice table saw for you. 
 The motor meets the standard amp of 15 and allows you to easily cut through thick woods. The safety guards this product has in place are also reassuring. It does not block your view of your project and protects you from accidentally touching the saw. Another important safety feature is the on/off switch. It is easy to reach and prevents overloading the machine. 
 The saw comes with a benchtop and storage that you can use. This is great for setting aside your tools or push stick when not using it. The extra room makes it a lot easier to work on your projects. This was the best value portable table saw that we could find. It offers you so much, at an efficient price. 
 Finally, many users felt that the saw was accurate and that it slid through their material nicely. It allowed many people to create projects that they felt proud of. We think this saw would be great for anyone interested in doing carpentry or wood projects at home.

 Our Rating 
 [Check Price 
 ](https://amzn.to/39vyENt) 
 Our Take 
 Users reported that the saw was easy to use and transport. However, the instructions that came with the table saw did little help in constructing it. If you wanted a saw that comes put together out of the box, this is not for you. There are videos on YouTube that can assist you in putting it together. 
 They also said that the accuracy was what they expected- not bad, but also not the best. The value is good and it does have some good features that make up for this. One of these is the multifunction blade, which works great under a variety of situations. 
 It does not take up a lot of storage space, so it might be better suited for those who need a saw but have limited places to keep it at home. 
 Overall, put the saw together carefully and you will have a fully functioning product with a strong 15 amp motor. You will want to be sure you have confidence in your abilities for this part since the company seems to be mostly unresponsive. We think this is a decent option, but you will need to be prepared to put in some extra time and maintenance to get the saw running well. 
 6. Ridgid R4513 Portable Table Saw with Stand

 Our Rating 
 [Check Price 
 ](https://amzn.to/33wUGfc) 
 Our Take 
 This portable saw received praise for being lightweight and coming with a durable fence. It feels alright to work with and the 15 amp motor is powerful enough to get the saw through a lot of different materials. 
 The 4,000 RPM allows you to get smoother cuts. It can technically even reach speeds of 4,400 RPM- although this is pushing it a bit. The table saw is decently portable, weighing in at 95 pounds. This is not as light as some people need, but it is not too heavy. 
 The saw guard is good and it comes with an anti-kickback system. The fence is extendable, making it more useful on a broader range of products. The fence can even detach and be used on the other side of the saw if you need it. 
 The table section includes additional storage for spare blades and wrenches, which is pretty helpful. While this saw is very loud, the soft start feature prevents it from being too much when you turn it on, giving you more time to adjust to the sounds. 
 Users had mixed feelings on this saw, rating it lower than other options here. This is a saw that you either hate a lot or are in love with- barely any in between.

 Our Take 
 The Oliver portable table saw comes with a durable saw guard, push stick, table extension, and a fence. Putting together the machine is simple and can be done pretty fast. If you have a project that you want to start working on soon, this can be a great choice. 
 It does not take up much space and offers clean cuts. The blade is smooth and quieter than some other saws in the same price range. (It is still loud, but not as loud as you might expect.) The soft-start feature adds to this small benefit as well. 
 The stand is also quite reliable. It does not shake or jostle your work around as other models do. If you are having a hard time getting your work to stay still, this can be a nice alternative table saw to use. 
 8. SKILSAW SPT99-11 Worm Drive Table Saw with Stand

 Precision rack 
 Dust port 
 Anti-kickback system 
 Smart guard 
 
 Our Rating 
 [Check Price 
 ](https://amzn.to/2VhgSFw) 
 Our Take 
 If you need a strong machine, this is a good option. The blade can cut 3 ⅝ inches deep and cut across wood smoothly. It is definitely a “heavy duty” saw like the brand claims. The motor is 15 AMPs and can even cut through entire sheets of plywood. 
 The stand is durable as well. You can move it around easily, transporting it across your job site without much hassle. When it comes to safety features, there is a removable clip that can turn off the power when pulled. 
 The worm drive feature was what pulled many users in. Worm drive saws typically have their motor at the back end and get more torque by giving up RPM. This helps to create a powerful blade. 
 Customer service with this brand is also quite responsive. They will replace broken parts and help you fix issues that might arise from shipping. The only real downside to the machine is that it is complicated to build the stand. Some users mentioned it took them an hour to get it together and running. 
 So, if you have a project you need to start ASAP, this might not be the best choice. However, if you want a strong saw and are willing to take additional time to get it running, this would meet your needs for a powerful cut.

 Our Take 
 The height of this table saw can be adjusted to your preferences, making it more customizable than many other options on this list. It is pretty loud, but that does not detract from the many benefits it has to offer you. 
 The fence lines up squarely to the blade and allows for very accurate cuts. If you are doing projects that need to be precise, this would be a great machine to have on-site. Be sure that you use a shop vac or some other dust collector with it- this saw does make a huge mess. 
 This portable saw is insanely durable and going to last you years. If you want to make one investment and not have to worry about getting a replacement, this saw is the way to go. It is best for people who enjoy woodworking and want a reliable tool to use daily. 
 This machine delivers up to 4 horsepower- which is twice as much as many other motors. This makes it perfect for handling thicker materials. The Smart Guard in place as a safety feature works reliably and prevents you from accidentally cutting yourself. 
 If you are uncertain about this product, the company does offer a 1-year manufacturer warranty and a 30-day money-back guarantee. This will allow you to experiment with the tool, but still be able to return it if something were to go wrong or it was not to your liking.

 Our Take 
 This saw stand comes in a compact design that you can move easily and store with little space available. It comes with 2 positions you can adjust it to so that it can match your height a little bit better. The instructions can be a little tricky, but it is not impossible to set up. 
 Many users enjoyed the quality of the Makita saw and appreciated that it could be adjusted to work on uneven ground. It is durable and simple- so you can expect to get a lot of work out of it. 
 It only weighs about 65 pounds, allowing for the saw to be easily moved around your worksite. Users said it worked best for cutting crown molding, baseboard, and other long wood materials. 
 For as well as this product works, the price is a great value. If you need a saw on a budget, be sure to check out this product. For the cost, it is going to offer a lot of benefits when you add your saw to it. 
 It improves the portability and makes it easier to adjust the saw to your height. If you were having any issues with your Makita saw in the past, this saw stand can be a great benefit- making your experience with the tool much better. It can help you achieve the most accurate portable table saw possible. 
 Portable Jobsite Tablesaw Ultimate Buyer’s Guide 
 When it comes to buying the perfect portable table saw for yourself, you want to be sure that it has the features you need. In this quick guide, we will be breaking down these aspects so you can find them in your products easier. 
 Portable Table Saw Types 
 There are three types of portable table saws out there. When buying one, you will want to know they are, as each has its uses: 
 
 Portable Jobsite Tablesaw  : These models are usually mounted on a stand. They are large and heavy- but not to the point where they are no longer portable. The job site table saw is designed to function at construction sites, meaning that it is more durable and often comes with additional safety features. 
 Compact Table Saw  : These models are similar to job site table saws, but have a smaller table. They are usually a bit lighter and have toothed belts in their saw system. Many people find them useful for contracting work or home projects due to their versatile nature. 
 Benchtop Table Saw  : The benchtop table saw is usually placed on a workbench. They do not come with a stand, meaning they are the lightest type and the easiest to transport. They are typically most useful to homeowners and those looking to complete a DIY project in a limited amount of space. 
 Cabinet Tablesaw  : These are much larger, designed to be left in place in a workshop. Professional woodworking shops are often built around  cabinet table saws  as they take up a large volume of space. 
 
 Portable jobsite Tablesaw Parts 
 If you are new to table saws, these are the parts that you are going to be hearing about the most as you browse products. You will want to know about the blade, miter gauge, and rip fence the most. 
 The Blade 
 The blade is the most important part- it is going to have the largest effect on how your projects turn out. You will want to be sure that you are using a blade that is sturdy and not dull. 
 The RPM is the feature you want to be the most familiar with. It refers to the number of rotations the blade can make in a minute. When it comes to a portable jobsite tablesaw, you will want an RPM of at least 4,000-4,5000. This allows you to easily slice through a lot of woods and soft materials, such as plastic. 
 The amount of teeth is also important. When there are more, you are going to get a smoother cut. 
 The Miter Gauge 
 The  miter gauge  keeps your material at a certain angle. This allows you to make precise cuts at an angle. You can tilt the gauge to achieve a bevel on your designs. As you become more familiar with using this handy tool, you will find that there are more creative things you can do with it. 
 The Rip Fence 
 The rip fence is used as a cutting guide. It will run along the length of your table parallel to the direction the blade cuts. This keeps your material in position and aids you in making your cuts straight across. 
 Important Safety Features 
 Your safety is important while working with a portable jobsite table saw. You will want to ensure that your product has enough features in place that you can use it comfortably and without worry. These are some things that you can find on many saws. 
 The Anti-Kickback Pawls 
 Anti-kickback pawls are attached to both sides of the splitter. They hold onto stray materials so that you do not get hit with them. It is important to have on any power saw to reduce the chance of injury. 
 The Splitter 
 A splitter is a tool that adds more safety to you while cutting. It sits behind the blade of the table saw and prevents any pieces of loose material from flying out at you. They usually can be removed, but you will want to ensure that you put them back on when using material that has a lot of kickback. 
 The Push Stick 
 This stick is used to move the material you want to cut into the saw path. This prevents you from having to put your hands near the blade. If you want to avoid potential injuries, you should be certain to make use of this safety feature. 
 Other Helpful Features 
 When it comes to a portable saw, these features are not necessary- but can make using your tool so much easier and more efficient. Be sure to keep an out for these parts! 
 A Table Extension 
 If you are working with a large piece of material, you might want to consider adding a table extension. They give you more surface space to work on and can be attached pretty easily. Most saw models will have a place for you to stick one on. 
 A Portable Stand 
 If you want to make it even easier to transport your table saw on the job site, you can put it on a stand. This makes it easier to roll around the machine. You will want to seriously consider getting one if you are using a heavier saw. 
 Many also add additional storage space that you can make use of. If you hate having to carry all your tools around, you could simply slip them in the drawer when you did not need them. 
 FAQ 
 Are portable jobsite tablesaws worth it? 
 Yes, they are more cost-effective than traditional table saws. This saves you money and space. Plus, they give you a way to work on your projects reliably on your own, so you do not have to hire someone else to cut the material for you. 
 Overall, they are definitely worth it. We recommend that you read more about what they can do and decide if you could use one at home. 
 Do I need a stand for a portable jobsite tablesaw? 
 If you want to make your saw more stable and easier to work on, we would have to say yes. Adding a sturdy stand to the workplace can give you more table space to work with and make the saw even easier to transport as well. 
 How do you push the wood through a table saw? 
 You will want to use a push stick, especially if your piece of material is getting small. You do not want to have to put your body near the saw. 
 If you do not have a push stick, you can always use a spare piece of wood to push the wood through. It keeps your hand above the saw, so there is no way that you can be cut. You can buy these or make your own easily. 
 What should I look for when buying a table saw? 
 You will want to keep your eyes open for quality blades, miter gauges, and rip fences. These are the most important parts of the saw, as they can directly affect how all of your projects turn out. When looking for a blade, be sure that the area around it is flat. If it is not, you will not be getting the best cuts from your saw. 
 How much horsepower do you need for a table saw? 
 That is going to depend on the types of materials you are working with. If you are using hardwood, we recommend that you find a motor with at least 3 horsepower. If you went up to 5 horsepower, this would be easier on the motor and blade, allowing you to cut more material without wearing out the machine. 
 What can I use instead of a table saw? 
 If you are in a pinch, you can use a circular saw with some kind of guide. This usually works out well, although table saws do typically give you a better cut. A jigsaw can also work, although the cut is not going to be smooth at all.
