 10 Reasons a Woman Would Want Santa's Job 
 Adapted from internet 
 No more panicking about what to wear to work. 
 No one would dare ask Santa Claus for a ride to work. 
 One big brown belt and you'd be accessorized for life. 
 Sensible footwear. 
 You'd never have to make the coffee. 
 No office politics; a hearty ho-ho-ho would remind everyone who is the boss. 
 Your children would adore you; even your teenagers would want to sit in your lap. 
 You'd never take the wrong coat on your way home. 
 You could grow a tummy the size of Texas and consider it a job requirement. 
 No one would ask to see your job description.
