 Nose job 
 My daughter Annabel Fenwick Elliott has been let loose at the London Telegraph to write about all sorts of other stuff apart from travel (her main subject). 
 An  article  of hers just published is about her nose job. As usual, a really good read. 
 Curious, I decided to read the comments. Sometimes, readers' comments can be viciously unpleasant. But this time, I rather agree with the general drift: she looked great before and looks great after. I love her equally either way. And of course I would love her equally if she did not look great.
