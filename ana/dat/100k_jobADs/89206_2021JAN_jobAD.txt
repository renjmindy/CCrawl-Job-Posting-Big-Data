 So it was fun this evening, trying to  tell my mother that I am on antidepressants  without making it sound like a big deal. My mother has that inherent distaste towards mental illness which all the older generation seem to have, so it was hard to slip this in casually during a normal phone conversation. 
 "Oh, nothing really new. You? Work is about the same. Oh! I'm on antidepressants now. 
 "Yeahâ€¦ I was crying a lot the other night so Perfect Husband popped me into the hospital. 
 "Yeah, I'm fine. 
 "Hey, did you hear that  Boy Cousin got a NOSE JOB?  Yes, MY boy cousin! A nose job!  Isn 't that crazy? 
 "â€¦It's called Wellbutrin. But you should  really  call your brother and gossip with him about his son's nose job. 
 "Yes, I'm fine, really. Come onâ€¦ NOSE JOB!" 
 Despite my conviction that my cousin's unexpected and probably unwarranted cosmetic surgery was more interesting news, my mother seemed to want to fixate on  why  I need medication and more importantly  whether it was her fault . 
 Of course, she decided that it probably  was  her fault, because she thinks  everything  is her fault. Like,  everything.  World War II? Yeah, that happened because my mother  wasn 't a good enough mother to me . In fact, Eve probably wouldn't have eaten the apple if only my mother hadn't transferred her latent anxieties to me in my childhood! It's a good thing my mother comes clean about stuff like this, or  the world would never know .

 Yep, add me to the list of people whose mothers are more concerned about how your drug use reflects on them, than how you are actually going. 
 And really, of course it's your mother's faultâ€¦. it's either environmental or genetic, after all! ðŸ˜‰ (I haven't said that to my mother. Yet.)
