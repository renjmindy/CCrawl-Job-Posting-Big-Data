 Writing Tips 
 Writing Tip: Failure is just Part of the Job 
 November 2, 2020August 16, 2020   kaylaannauthor 
 Let me be honest. Failure is going to be a part of your writing career. It just is. And let me be blunt. Failure is going to be a part of life. 
 We are humans, we  cannot  succeed at everything, all the time. 
 So, before you begin your career as an author, an artist, a composer, a teacher, whatever you choose, accept that at some point  you will fail . However, failure is NOT the end. 
 Failure today does not mean that you cannot succeed tomorrow. 
 This is where we so often get bogged down. We receive a rejection letter, or we get passed up for the job that we want and we assume that this is the end. That is where we need to actively work every day to change our mindset. Failure is only a moment in time, a response to a singular incident. Failure does not define you or your career. The best option, and really the only option you have for success,  is to accept failure and then move on from it . 
 Sometimes our failures will be small.  For us authors, that might mean that we did not hit our desired word count for that day, or maybe even that month, or maybe we can't remember the last time we sat down with the intention of solely writing. We cannot let that stop us. We cannot throw our hands in the air and say, "Well, I've been failing at this goal lately so it's over!" Nope, we move forward, we sit down and we try again! 
 Sometimes our failures will be big . Maybe that means a big ol' rejection letter that makes you want to give up writing for good. That is one option and honestly, the choice is up to you, but if you really love writing, you'll try again. Maybe that means sending your manuscript to a different publishing house, or maybe that means taking a hard look at your own manuscript and figuring out how it can be improved. 
 So accept failure, but do not let it define you. Do not let it stop you. Do not let it hinder your progress. Acknowledge it, learn from it, be strengthened by it. 
 Accept Failure but Never Stop Moving Forward.

 Ae matey, remember that .300 be a good batting average for yer baseball slugger. Which means he be failin' 70% of the time. But he still be going out there and taking his whacks.
