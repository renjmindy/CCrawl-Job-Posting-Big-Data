 Finding a job has always been a problem in our economy, so Slip is trying to make it easier for all of us. With this in mind, online job hunting networks are always a good way to find a job, but what if you could find one via your friends contacts? Well with Slip, you now can. The whole idea behind slip, is to use your Facebook's friends work connections to land you a job. Not only will this help you find a job, it will also help employers find more detailed information about potential employees. So whether you join Slips 700,000 plus network of contacts, or stick to the old fashion route, make sure you look over your Facebook page, as you don't want your future employer looking at what you did last night.
