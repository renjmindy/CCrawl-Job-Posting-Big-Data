 Description 
 Dear Illustrators, 
 we are holding a yearly event about japanese popculture in Dusseldorf, Germany. It's called DoKomi - short for Doitsu Komikku Maaketo. 
 For our website and program booklet, we would like to make a drawn background illustration of the event's location, the congress center Dusseldorf and it's surroundings. 
 Please find reference pictures of the congress center Dusseldorf here: 
 https://www.google.de/search?q=congress+center+d%C3%BCsseldorf&espv=2&biw=1024&bih=727&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=cM9gVP2HEqvW7AbjoYDICw&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg 
 Regarding the style of the picture, we thought of a Makoto Shinkai-styled, atmospheric image. Something, a simple photograph cannot provide.
