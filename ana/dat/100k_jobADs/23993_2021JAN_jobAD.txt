 Out Of A Job - And Into A New Blog! 
 114 Replies 
 It is the best of times, it is the worst of times. I'm not in the habit of plagiarising Dickens, but the two of us do have one thing in common: We were both paid by the word.  Were  being the operative one in this lamentable context. I shall explain‚Ä¶ 
 Tuesday two weeks ago, at 11 am, I received a devastating call. I had lost my writing gig. ‚ÄúA change of corporate focus,‚Äù I was told. A decision taken by management in a far-away head office, by people I had never had any direct dealings with. Unlike all the other times, this latest reshuffle within the company, which had supplied me with a steady flow of work for the past twelve years, had not turned out to my advantage. To put it mildly. 
 There would still be some work for me, I was assured. However, it was going to be of a different nature and ‚Äì as far as I could tell ‚Äì there wasn‚Äôt going to be enough of it to keep me in fodder. 
 In short, it was the kind of news which puts the wind of existential panic up a freelancer's arse. Or make that a hurricane. 
 The state of red alert lasted for about 24 hours. A fellow freelancer, bless her kindly soul, shuffled me a contact promising me regular work in my field. A couple of days later, another potential client registered an interest. 
 Maybe, just maybe, I was going to be OK. 
 But August being August, nothing happens fast, so I‚Äôm having to exercise my very puniest of mental muscles: my patience. A bit of distraction was called for, and seeing as I‚Äôd been sitting for absolutely ages on the desire to start a fresh blog venture, I decided to go for it, and my brand spanking new dedicated language blog  '   Multilingual By Choice  '  (it's meant to make me sound like a purposeful and focused individual who doesn't spend three quarters of her day lounging around in pyjamas ogling cake porn) was finally born. 
 No need to groan quite so heartily, people - I won't be attempting to "make grammar fun" or go on about the aspirated phoneticisation of gerundiated nouns. It's going to be more about life than linguistics. Take a look:  http://www.multilingualbychoice.blogspot.com 
 But before you dash off to coo over my shiny new baby, do have some cake! I‚Äôve a splendid selection prepared for you, all sampled and approved by yours truly: 
 Holiday Cake üôÇ 
 Lemon sponge cake. One of my Mum's creations. 
 Posh Shopping Centre Cake 
 Made by one of my Mum's friends with apples from her garden 
 Another friend, another cake üôÇ Apricot & custard this time. 
 And here it is in its entirety 
 Oh, and I've got a new blog, did I mention that?!  http://www.multilingualbychoice.blogspot.com

 Ahh. Sorry! Man, I have spent all month complaining about articles not getting accepted‚Ä¶or I am 'too this' or 'too that'..give me a break. Anyway, lovely pictures and I will check out your new blog. And gosh, those pictures of cake and puddings were simply divine.

 Glad to hear that you have some leads on employment. A girl's got to have cake money! And what lovely cakes they are (I vote for the apricot custard). You won't be abandoning THIS blog, I hope? I stopped by the new one and enjoyed your post, but I can't follow you because you seem to have chosen a different blogging platform. Any particular reason for that?

 I just fancied experimenting with a different platform, that's all. I have no plans of abandoning WP, or this blog! You can follow the blogspot one by email. There's also the option of adding it to your WP reader, you¬¥d have to instigate this through WP, but, sadly, it's not reliable at picking new posts up, in my experience.

 Well, there was a bit of moping, I do admit, but I'm fairly sure this wasn't personal, or a reflection on my work per so. I was, in fact, lucky to have been kept on at all. "My" people at the company, i.e. those who I deal with personally have always appreciated my work, they were pretty upset about this change of direction and have been doing everything they can to help me. Still are, in fact. We'll see how it pans out. I'll keep you posted üôÇ

As for the cake, the apple one and the apricot look lovely, but having given up both sugar (except in minuscule quantity) and gluten, they are rather out of reach‚Ä¶.

 So if you don't see scads of comments from me? Its cos I'm getting posts via email, chortling away with you but mute thanks to my own inability to learn a new blog platform. And new language?? Beyond my capacity currently - clearly! üôÇ

 I sure do appreciate your loyalty, Carissa! 
 Blogspot is trying my patience, I must admit, but am hoping those are teething problems. I realise the commenting part sucks, which is a tad disappointing. If I get too frustrated with it, I'll just have to pick up my marbles and move somewhere else!

 Where to start with my three competing ideas? ok. 1) OOOOH,,,,, the cakes! the pies! is that streudel?! My hips just grew 2 inches looking at those pictures. 2) so sorry for your regular paying gig drying up, and all best wishes for a new paying job soon. 3) best of luck trying to keep up two blogs - I tried a second one and just could not keep up ‚Ä¶. but then I'm more OCD and have mine on a strict schedule, so your flexible nature may make it way more doable. Curious, now - I'll see you at your other site. Hug hug.

 Oy! So sorry to hear the news. But you're a great and funny writer, and I'm sure that if there's words to be spun, you're the woman for the job. In short, it'd seem like you should be able to find more work. 
 As for your new blog, I'll take a look. But I must say, I heartily disapprove of your decision to go with Blogspot/Blogger rather than WordPress. If you must use Blogspot/Blogger, I hope you at least implement Disqus commenting.

 I have a Blogspot blog because I too was curious. But I played around with the dashboard and posted a couple of test posts and decided that WP was right for me. I have thought about writing a blog about investing and politics, but want to keep its readership separate from my Mexico blog. Maybe blogspot would be good for that. Anyway, saludos y suerte!

 That was part of my rationale, too. I.e. to draw in a wider readership beyond WP, access the google community (whatever that is - I've still got to actually find them‚Ä¶) 
 I'm still planning to post some language-themed pieces here on LOTC (as well as on the new one), but only the ones that have what I judge as a more general-interest appeal.

 I wonder about this "google community" too. I have a google account so as to post YouTube videos, but I (somewhat paranoidly) try to share as little about myself with Google as possible. As for the other blog, yes, if it ever happens, I'll send it to you. But I think it'll only appeal to a very narrow audience, at least the trading part. As for politics, that can quickly become a viper's den, so I may never do that one. Saludos!

 My first blogs were blogger. I tried both and blogger was infinitely better at the time, say 2007? I could fiddle with templates, customise, I liked the feature of following blogs and new updates came up on my blog. It was good. 
 But, as with WP they kept changing things so I took the WP plunge. In the intervening however many years, WP had improved whereas blogger hadn't. Nor did I approve of being locked out of my blog. Anyways I've followed through reader, so I may,  may  get round to commenting. At least I didn't see any flipping cake over there!

 I know the feeling! Irregular work was my life for the last 6 years. That's how I was able to spend so much time on SloWord and the reason why it is so popular with the multitudes who steadfastly refuse to read it. The last 18 months were entirely work free, hence the completion of The Play and 80% of "The Diary of a Boring Man". 
 Now, have a full time job again which keeps me commuting into Toronto every day. Very taxing, this work thing! Can't get any writing done. 
 I'm sure things will work out. Look on the bright side, there'll always be cake to photograph‚Ä¶..
