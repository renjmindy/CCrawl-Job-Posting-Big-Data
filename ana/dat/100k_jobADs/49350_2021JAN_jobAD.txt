  Information Systems That Aid Job Search  
 William Stevens 
 April 18, 2013 
 If you are looking for a change, you are probably actively browsing the Net and checking information systems that can help you land a job. Internet has made life easier and brought the world closer. Also, for job seekers, it has been easier to explore opportunities with the click of a mouse. Realizing the need and demand for tools to facilitate ease of  job search , many information systems have come about to make things easier. 
 
 Information Systems That Aid Job Search 
 If you are also looking for a job and want to know more about platforms that can help you help you find opportunities, here are some information systems you will find useful: 
 Google 
 Google has been a pioneer in making the Internet more relevant for its users. It has upgraded its services to help users find jobs and advance their careers.  Google Alerts , for example, is a potent tool that has made it easier for job seekers to explore opportunities. Instead of checking several job boards daily, Google Alerts lets users set up an alarm and receive information on new openings automatically. Another powerful platform from Google is Google+, which features Circles to take the social experience to another level. By posting your job messages for appropriate Circles, you can improve your chances of getting a job. Likewise, there are several hangouts that have made it easier to appear for interviews without the hassle of traveling. 
 Monster 
 Monster is one of the earliest information systems developed to help job seekers around the world. Over the years, this job search engine has undergone several changes to make it easier for its users to get a job. You can narrow down your search by keyword, location, employer, and salary. To further help its users, Monster provides additional features such as job search alerts, online resume posting, and networking boards. 
 LinkedIn 
 In the age of social networking, employers are looking for innovative ways to connect with prospective employees. To help professionals connect with one another and find appropriate job openings,  LinkedIn  has created a balanced ecosystem. What sets LinkedIn apart from other information systems is the professional approach it adopts. It is a platform where only professionals gather, exchange ideas, interact, and find job opportunities. For employers, a quick search on LinkedIn provides an overview of the candidate's academic and professional background. It is a more informative medium than the resume to know about the candidate as profile features include recommendations from colleagues, managers, and clients. 
 Craigslist 
 Craigslist is a very effective medium to find out about interesting job openings. You can search by city and find various job openings. You can even set up RSS feeds to know about jobs that may be of some interest to you. A word of caution though is to verify the authenticity of the ads on Craigslist because it is a free site and anyone can post job openings on it. 
 Facebook 
 Another useful medium to find out about job openings is Facebook. Although the site is extensively used for social networking, in the recent years it has become a very useful medium to connect with prospective employers. Considering the amount of time people spend on Facebook, hiring managers feel that the profile provides a lot of insightful information. To become a more useful platform for job search, Facebook launched a Social Jobs App that provides listings from BranchOut and Monster. As the number of HR managers resorting to Facebook to find candidates increases, this social networking site is trying to become more user-friendly. Thanks to the information systems, you don't have to waste your time and energy on job search. A great profile on the popular sites can land you the right job. 
 William Stevens writes articles in relation to technology. In this article, he offers a few systems that aid job search, and aims to encourage further study with a  master of information systems management.
