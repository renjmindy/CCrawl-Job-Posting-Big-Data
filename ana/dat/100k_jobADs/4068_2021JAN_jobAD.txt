 Remote Back-End Engineer REMOTEPERMANENT 
 Job Description 
 We’re on the lookout for our next Back-End Engineer, could it be you? Our engineers help mission-driven organizations and forward-thinking companies build for the other side of the screen.

NO RECRUITERS OR AGENCIES PLEASE AND THANK YOU. 
 About Zaengle: 
 Zaengle is a web engineering firm that’s a digital force for good. We build software, digital products, and websites for non-profits, digital agencies, and businesses. We're a 100% remote team across the US and UK. Each team member has a lot of autonomy and influence — this means we only hire folks who are highly motivated, accountable, and operate with integrity. You’ll be encouraged to develop creative solutions to problems, communicate and defend your ideas to clients, manage your responsibilities, and stay up-to-date on the latest best practices. 
 What We’re Looking For:   The Most Important Things 
 We want to talk to you if you are: 
 
 Self-motivated.  You don’t want to be micromanaged, or have your hand held. You don’t shy away from hard work, and always embrace new challenges. 
 Self-aware.  You’re confident in your strengths and know what your weaknesses are. These don’t discourage you, rather, they make you even stronger. 
 Honest.  You aren’t perfect, and neither are we. Integrity, honesty, and humility are hallmarks of your life. 
 Generous.  You love helping others, sharing your expertise, and creatively giving back. 
 A genuine communicator.  When you talk to clients, or your teammates, you’re clear, to the point, confident, and genuine. 
 A learner.  When you don’t know something it’s not a roadblock — you passionately seek answers and solutions without being told to.

 PHP / Laravel 
 VueJS
