 One Term Proposition 
 “ I will be held accountable. If I don't have this done in 3 years, then there's going to be a one term proposition.” 
 “ This is Obama's economy, that's fine. Give it to me.” - B. Hussain Obama 
 One term, you want it - you got it.

 A Better America Begins Tonight 
 A better America begins tonight and together, we are going to win on November 6th. 
 We can do better. Tonight is the beginning of the end of the disappointment of the Obama years. 
 “ After 25 years, I know how to lead us out of this stagnant obama economy and into a job creating recovery. 
 It's still about the economy and we're not stupid … poverty will be defeated, not with a government check but with respect and achievement. 
 And this time, we'll get it right. We're Americans. Our greatest days are ahead. God bless this great Nation. 
 God Bless the United States of America and God bless you good people. Thank you.” - President Mitt Romney

 Obama Economic Crash Coming 
 Obama fail - economic crash coming. 
 “ We're just printing money. The Federal Reserve is now I'm estimating a Trillion and a half dollars [$1,500,000,000,000] in credit to the EU [European Union]. 
 This propping up of Greece is a farce. Greece is going to default, it's going to further default, Italy and a whole series of other countries in the EU. 
 The United States housing market is headed for worse than depression levels. Real unemployment, if you measured it accurately would be more like 22 or 25%. 
 The number of people on dependency of the Federal Government: food stamps, unemployment insurance, you name it is growing everyday. 
 We're not going to create any jobs in an economy where government regulations are so tight. 
 We're on a straight slide down in to a continuing global depression that will make the 30's look like a picnic.” - Dr. Jerome Corsi, PhD Harvard

 State of the Union as the Money Runs Out 
 State of the Union and Obama's speech discussed by Alex Jones and Gerald Celente and not settling for the lesser of two evils. 
 Jones wonders aloud that as the money runs out, will the minions wake up when they've lost everything to the greedy corporate vultures. 
 We're going to get everybody in debt to our fraudulent paper [bankrupt them] then there'll be riots, then we'll bring even more control. 
 That will drive down the value of everything, then we can buy everything up. 
 “ They will try to bankrupt everybody just so they can consolidate everything? It's all up to us, what ends up happening, but I don't see this ending pretty. 
 They're going to start a Big War [the First Great War of the 21st Century] - the Globalists making 40-1 bets - three million guns sold in the month of December in the US alone - Congress with a 9% approval rating.” - Alex Jones
