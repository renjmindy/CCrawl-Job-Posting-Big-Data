 5 THINGS YOU MUST DO DURING THIS AGONIZING WAITING PERIOD 
 Posted on  January 11, 2021January 11, 2021  by  mariomurilloministries 
   
 
 You can’t dwell on the frightening images you will see on cable news. You can’t cave in to the hysteria. There is something extremely important you must take care of. 
 
 After you have taken every precaution necessary for siding with truth—after you have settled it in your soul to remain strong in the Lord, wholly trusting in Him, it will be time for you to fight in a new way. 
 Everything in me tells me these are the most important days you will know in our lifetime. Waste them, and it will be the greatest regret of your life. 
 Turn your time of waiting into the most important breakthrough ever. Turn feelings of helplessness into fuel for an amazing outcome. These are days to let God do a shocking new work inside you. 
 It all begins with the story of Paul being arrested and put in prison. Satan put Paul in prison, intending to inflict massive damage on Christianity. He thought Paul could no longer win souls, and he could not teach the fledgling churches that desperately needed his Apostleship. In fact, he couldn’t do anything…except for one thing. 
 He began writing. And writing would be the most devastating thing Paul would ever do to Satan’s kingdom. If Paul hadn’t been confined, he might never have had the time to write.  How could he possibly imagine his writings would impact billions? Paul ended up writing 60% of the New Testament. Selah. 
 Jailing Paul was the stupidest mistake Satan ever made, besides crucifying Christ. Now let me show you how to make this illegal new attempt to confinement in your home, his next major mistake. 
 
 1. Model faith to your children.  Settle it in your soul that God will pay your bills, protect your job and restore what you have lost. Don’t speak fear and doubt in your home! The greatest lesson you will ever model for your children—and the greatest gift you will ever leave to them—is to confess that everything that has been lost will be restored. Because when this is over and God comes through—as you know He will—they will remember and apply these lessons in their lives, whenever they are threatened.  The greatest thing your children can watch you do is trust in God. 
 
 2. Read the Bible. Dump all the negative contradictory rhetoric confused preachers are speaking.  Preachers are losing credibility because they foolishly predicted things and then recanted their predictions In the Old Testament such “waffling prophets” would have been stoned. It is this lack of discipline in some prophetic camps that has wreaked havoc and left many unprepared for the storm that is upon us. 
 The same applies to conspiracies and accusations against Trump.  How much clearer can the Bible be? Isaiah 8:12-13, “Do not say, ‘A conspiracy,’ concerning all that this people call a conspiracy, neither be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled. The Lord of Armies, Him you shall hallow; let Him be your fear, and let Him be your dread.” 
 I am a strong advocate for the fact that this election has been stolen. However, if I let myself begin to fight only in the natural, and I am thrown by the latest developments it can cripple faith. 
 Stop needing a “word from God” from people. Take a breather from digging for emotional resolution. This is a long war that won't end quickly. In 2 Timothy 2:23 Paul warned, “Have nothing to do with foolish, ignorant controversies; you know that they breed quarrels.” 
 Instead, read the Bible! Now that you have a lot of time, get the Word of God in you. That is the most powerful protection, and the best way to understand how to weather this storm. 
 
 3. Make a list of goals for this waiting period, and work hard to meet those goals.  Already, you see how many things have stolen your time. You see how many things that previously cluttered your life, seem unimportant now. Because you are a child of God, nothing of yours that is vital will be stolen. Your job and your business will be brought back to life. Therefore, choose to see this as a kind of paid vacation. Paid by God. 
 It is a time to make overdue changes, and big and bold plans for the future. To do that, you must get to work. That means no binge-watching Netflix! It means you seek the heart of God and ask Him to show you the goals He wants you to accomplish. Write those goals out, and make the righteous choices that give those goals the very best chance of coming to pass. 
 This intentional goal setting insults the devil's threats against you. 
 Paul wrote much of the New Testament while he was in forced confinement. This waiting period can feel like jail! But great projects will be born—projects that may swallow up the wrong ones you had before. 
 Lastly make the most important goal list of all: the things you are never are never going back to. 
 
 4.Turn prayer into a habit. Inspiration will lead you to pray, but you must decide to form the habit that will keep you praying.  The chilling fact is that if you do not pray during this pandemic, you will never pray at all. Let God deliver you from the greatest hindrances to prayer that I know of: impulse prayer and feeling-based prayer. 
 Right now, forget about how long you pray. Focus on praying each and every day. Behaviorists have shown that it takes doing something 35 times in a row, before it becomes a habit. If you create that habit, and deepen that habit, you will own life’s greatest skill. James 5:16, “Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much.” 
 5. Focus on  personal  repentance, not  national  repentance.  You do it! Don't wait for others, or even think about other people's repentance. People have been babbling about national repentance as if it was something  other  people need to do. We don’t see national repentance happening yet, so don’t wait for it to happen. Repent on your own! 
 We still do not even see widespread repentance among preachers.  Have you heard many preachers on social media admit they’ve been wrong? We are flooded with messages from preachers. But have you heard one major pastor or preacher repent or promise that they will run church differently than they did before? Do you see many who are willing to stand with Trump at this hour? Do you see many preachers who aren't just chomping at the bit to restart the same old thing? I promise you, unless deep repentance takes place, you will be shocked at how unchanged the American church will be, after all of this. Think about this: How much really changed after 9/11? 
 Remember, God is judging America as much because of the world, as because of the church. The carnal church has left us open to this disaster. And yet, without repentance, we have zero reason to believe it won’t go back to exactly the way it was before. In other words, they will have learned nothing from the pandemic and the election. They just don’t get it. 
 
 We pray that God will not force the issue of repentance by extending and deepening our national crisis, until America implodes completely. But you have to wonder how they can all say they want this to be over, and yet they still will not repent. 
 But, we must not set our hope on that. Our hope is founded on the knowledge that we must repent before God—and that is  personal  repentance. 
 We are at the point where only a miracle from God will expose the deep corruption that has taken over the Democrats and their cohorts. Our helplessness is an opportunity to look to God in faith. 
 My prayer in this hijacked election is from 2 Chronicles 20:12 "O our God, will You not judge them? For we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes  are  upon You.” 
 Total trust will lead to the real miracle of mercy. You see, you can stand as a priest between the sins of America, the sins of the church, and God. That is true intercession. There is a righteous core of believers who can turn this plague away. (read Numbers chapter 16) 
 Remember, God said He would spare Sodom and Gomorrah if there were just 10 righteous people. We are not going to  rebuke  this away; we are going to  repent  it away. You have the power to stand between God and this virus. 
 We  must  give God what He is seeking. We can’t worry about how many others are interceding, even if there are only a few. The promises of the Lord are never vague! Neither are the conditions to His promises. 
 2 Chronicles 7:14, “If My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face,  and turn from their wicked ways,  then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land.”

 DO THESE FIVE THINGS DURING THE SHUTDOWN

 You can’t dwell on the frightening images you will see on cable news. You can’t cave in to the hysteria. There is something extremely important you must take care of. 
 After you have taken every precaution necessary for remaining safe—after you have settled it in your soul to remain strong in the Lord, wholly trusting in Him, it will be time for you to fight back. 
 Everything in me tells me these are the most important days you will know in our lifetime. Waste them, and it will be the greatest regret of your life.

 5 THINGS YOU MUST DO DURING THE SHUTDOWN

 Right now, forget about how long you pray. Focus on praying each and every day. Behaviorists have shown that it takes doing something 35 times in a row, before it becomes a habit. If you create that habit, and deepen that habit, you will own life’s greatest skill. James 5:16, “Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much.” 
 5. Focus on  personal  repentance, not  national  repentance.  You do it! Don't wait for others, or even think about other people's repentance. People have been babbling about national repentance as if it was something  other  people need to do. We don’t see national repentance happening yet, so don’t wait for it to happen. Repent on your own! 
 We do not even see widespread repentance among preachers.  Have you heard many preachers on social media admit they’ve been wrong? We are flooded with messages from preachers. But have you heard one major pastor or preacher repent or promise that they will run church differently than they did before? Do you see any preacher who isn’t just chomping at the bit to restart the same old thing? I promise you, unless deep repentance takes place, you will be shocked at how unchanged the American church will be, after all of this. Think about this: How much really changed after 9/11? 
 Remember, God is judging America as much because of the world, as because of the church. The carnal church has left us open to this disaster. And yet, without repentance, we have zero reason to believe it won’t go back to exactly the way it was before. In other words, they will have learned nothing from the pandemic. They just don’t get it. 
 
 We pray that God will not force the issue of repentance by extending and deepening our national crisis, until America implodes completely. But you have to wonder how they can all say they want this to be over, and yet they still will not repent. 
 But, we must not set our hope on that. Our hope is founded on the knowledge that we must repent before God—and that is  personal  repentance.  That will lead to the real miracle of mercy. You see, you can stand as a priest between the sins of America, the sins of the church, and God. That is true intercession. There is a righteous core of believers who can turn this plague away. (read Numbers chapter 16) 
 Remember, God said He would spare Sodom and Gomorrah if there were just 10 righteous people. We are not going to  rebuke  this away; we are going to  repent  it away. You have the power to stand between God and this virus. 
 We  must  give God what He is seeking. We can’t worry about how many others are interceding, even if there are only a few. The promises of the Lord are never vague! Neither are the conditions to His promises. 
 2 Chronicles 7:14, “If My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face,  and turn from their wicked ways,  then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land.”

 5 THINGS YOU MUST DO DURING THE SHUTDOWN 
 Posted on  April 6, 2020April 6, 2020  by  mariomurilloministries 
   
 The next few days will be very dark for America. Experts say we will see losses such as we have not seen since the Second World War. As horrendous as that statement is, there is something else you must realize. You can’t dwell on the frightening images you will see on cable news. You can’t cave in to the hysteria of this coming week. There is something extremely important you must take care of. 
 After you have taken every precaution necessary for remaining safe—after you have settled it in your soul to remain strong in the Lord, wholly trusting in Him, it will be time for you to fight back. 
 Everything in me tells me these are the most important days you will know in our lifetime. Waste them, and it will be the greatest regret of your life. 
 Turn your days at home into the most important breakthrough ever. Turn feelings of helplessness into fuel for an amazing outcome. These are days to let God do a shocking new work inside you. 
 It all begins with the story of Paul being arrested and put in prison. Satan put Paul in prison, intending to inflict massive damage on Christianity. He thought Paul could no longer win souls, and he could not teach the fledgling churches that desperately needed his Apostleship. In fact, he couldn’t do anything…except for one thing. 
 He began writing. And writing would be the most devastating thing Paul would ever do to Satan’s kingdom. If Paul hadn’t been confined, he might never have had the time to write.  How could he possibly imagine his writings would impact billions? Paul ended up writing 60% of the New Testament. Selah. 
 Jailing Paul was the stupidest mistake Satan ever made, besides crucifying Christ. Now let me show you how to make this confinement in your home, his next major mistake. 
 
 1. Model faith to your children.  Settle it in your soul that God will pay your bills, protect your job and restore what you have lost. Don’t speak fear and doubt in your home! The greatest lesson you will ever model for your children—and the greatest gift you will ever leave to them—is to confess that everything that has been lost will be restored. Because when this is over and God comes through—as you know He will—they will remember and apply these lessons in their lives, whenever they are threatened.  The greatest thing your children can watch you do is trust in God. 
 
 2. Read the Bible. Dump all the questionable prophetic words and conspiracy theories.  Some in the prophetic camp are losing credibility because they foolishly predicted this plague would leave suddenly. Some even set a date—one that will likely prove them wrong. In the Old Testament such “prophets” would have been stoned. It is this lack of consequence in the prophetic camp that has wreaked havoc and left many unprepared for the storm that is upon us. 
 The same applies to conspiracies.  How much clearer can the Bible be? Isaiah 8:12-13, “Do not say, ‘A conspiracy,’ concerning all that this people call a conspiracy, neither be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled. The Lord of Armies, Him you shall hallow; let Him be your fear, and let Him be your dread.” 
 It’s all over the internet, and religious broadcasting: ‘There is a worldwide secret society! It’s the devil and his vessels! Nancy Pelosi cooked up coronavirus in a Chinese laboratory!’ 
 Stop needing a “word from God” from people. Stop digging into controversy. In 2 Timothy 2:23 Paul warned, “Have nothing to do with foolish, ignorant controversies; you know that they breed quarrels.” 
 Instead, read the Bible! Now that you have a lot of time, get the Word of God in you. That is the most powerful protection, and the best way to understand how to weather this storm. 
 
 3. Make a list of goals for this down-time, and work hard to meet those goals.  Already, you see how many things have stolen your time. You see how many things that previously cluttered your life, seem unimportant now. Because you are a child of God, nothing of yours that is vital will be stolen. Your job and your business will be brought back to life. Therefore, choose to see this as a kind of paid vacation. Paid by God. 
 It is a time to make overdue changes, and big and bold plans for the future. To do that, you must get to work. That means no binge-watching Netflix! It means you seek the heart of God and ask Him to show you the goals He wants you to accomplish. Write those goals out, and make the righteous choices that give those goals the very best chance of coming to pass. 
 Paul wrote much of the New Testament while he was in forced confinement. Great projects will be born—projects that may swallow up the wrong ones you had before. 
 Lastly make the most important goal list of all: the things you are never are never going back to. 
 
 4.Turn prayer into a habit. Inspiration will lead you to pray, but you must decide to form the habit that will keep you praying.  The chilling fact is that if you do not pray during this pandemic, you will never pray at all. Let God deliver you from the greatest hindrances to prayer that I know of: impulse prayer and feeling-based prayer. 
 Right now, forget about how long you pray. Focus on praying each and every day. Behaviorists have shown that it takes doing something 35 times in a row, before it becomes a habit. If you create that habit, and deepen that habit, you will own life’s greatest skill. James 5:16, “Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed.

Do you see any preacher who isn’t just chomping at the bit to restart the same old thing? I promise you, unless deep repentance takes place, you will be shocked at how unchanged the American church will be, after all of this. Think about this: How much really changed after 9/11? 
 Remember, God is judging America as much because of the world, as because of the church. The carnal church has left us open to this disaster.

 Black disappointment with Obama threatens Democrats

 Black disappointment with Obama threatens Democrats 
 BY DAVID LIGHTMAN 
 McClatchy Washington BureauOctober 23, 2014 
 Akua Scott and Aaron McKinney (left and center), community organizers in South Florida, speak with customers at Jackson's Soul Food restaurant, a popular gathering place for many living in District 24, about voter turnout, in Overtown, Fla. "We had this idea once we got the first black president all our problems will be solved," said McKinney on Oct. 9, 2014.  PETER W. CROSS — McClatchy 
 MIAMI — Black voters’ disappointment with President Barack Obama, who they so eagerly embraced for so many years, could be costly on Election Day to Democrats, who badly need a big African-American turnout to win Senate and gubernatorial races in key states. 
 Instead, many African-Americans see an unemployment rate well above the national average, continuing problems with crime in many neighborhoods, and a president more interested in trying to help other voting blocs that didn’t give him such unwavering support. 
 He talks about same-sex marriage in a nod to the gay and lesbian community. He discusses immigration and its benefits, an issue particularly important to the Latino community. He fights for equal pay, a vital issue to the women Democrats so avidly court. 
 The black community, which gave Obama support like no other group, too often doesn’t see the investment paying off. 
 “People in this community just don’t think anything is going to change,” said Akua Scott, a Miami-based labor organizer. 
 Instead of obvious improvements in the economy, jobs can be tough to get and despair remains a constant. 
 “A lot of people don’t understand how government works. They think the president is a savior,” she said. 
 Obama remains hugely popular among blacks; last month’s McClatchy-Marist poll found 86 percent approved of the job he’s doing.  But the disapproval number was 12 percent, double its level just after the 2012 election. 
 In Miami’s Overtown neighborhood, a historic black community, people don’t necessarily blame the president for making it hard to get a job or stay financially afloat, but they had hoped for more. 
 “We had this idea that once we got the first black president, all our problems would be solved,” said Aaron McKinney, a Miami community organizer. He walked around the Jackson Soul Food restaurant in Overtown one day recently urging people to vote. 
 “People are happy to see a black man as president, but people in this environment see no way out,” said Dorrell Brown, a Miami longshoreman. “This is what they’ve believed for a long time, and it’s not changing.” 
 He and others echoed the views of some leading black scholars and commentators who have criticized Obama for not doing enough for the black community. 
 “He posed as a progressive and turned out to be counterfeit,” Cornel West, a professor of philosophy and Christian practice at Union Theological Seminary in New York City, told Salon.com in August. 
 Democrats badly need black voters to turn out in November. Its most endangered Senate incumbents last ran in 2008, the year Obama first won the presidency. 
 When blacks stay home, Democrats in states with large African-American constituencies often lose. In Florida, former Gov. Charlie Crist, running as a Democrat, needs those voters. Florida’s black voters gave Obama 95 percent of the 2012 presidential vote and made up 13 percent of the electorate. 
 Two years earlier, in the state’s 2010 gubernatorial election, their share was 11 percent. The drop in turnout hurt. Though blacks gave Democrat Alex Sink 93 percent of their vote, Republican Rick Scott, who’s now running against Crist, won by 1 percentage point. 
 Black turnout could matter in governors races in Arkansas, Maryland, Michigan, Georgia and South Carolina, and it also could be crucial in swinging a handful of Senate races this year. 
 In Louisiana, Sen. Mary Landrieu, a Democrat, has a tough road to re-election. She last won six years ago, when the black vote was 29 percent of the total and gave her a 96 percent to 2 percent majority, according to exit polls. That more than offset her 2-to-1 losing ratio among whites. 
 In North Carolina, another Democrat, Sen. Kay Hagan, is also battling for another term. In 2008, blacks were 19 percent of the vote and Hagan rolled up a 96-1 win while losing the white vote by 18 percentage points. She won that race with 53 percent. Strong black turnout could also be crucial to Democrats in Georgia, Kentucky and Arkansas. 
 Turnout historically plunges in midterm elections, which lack the glamor of the presidential race. Candidates are not as well-known, and unless there’s a compelling issue that affects a lot of people personally, such as a reeling economy, many see little personal stake in voting. 
 Democrats have a dilemma. Obama is increasingly unpopular in key states, and promoting him too heavily, let alone bringing him in to campaign, would be a political liability. But not sending him there means the party can’t use an important weapon to motivate its most loyal constituency. 
 So the Democrats are trying a variety of tactics to stir the vote. Obama’s organizational infrastructure is still regarded as strong, and the Congressional Black Caucus is active in Freedom Sunday, a campaign that began a month ago and centers on African-American church organizations. 
 Black leaders are also stoking fears that a Republican Senate takeover will make life miserable. Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, the Congressional Black Caucus chairwoman, warned that Obama’s impeachment would be high on the agenda if Republicans run Congress. Some conservatives have floated the idea, but it is considered highly unlikely to go anywhere. 
 Democrats also remind black voters that many Republicans back laws that require voters to show photo IDs at the polls. Many in the black community regard such laws as an effort to suppress their votes, because studies have shown a disproportionate number of minority voters lack government-issued photo IDs. 
 Republicans say they, too, are unusually active. Lingering economic problems in the black community “create a window of opportunity for us to go into these communities and share our message,”  said Orlando Watson, a Republican Party spokesman. Unemployment among blacks was 11 percent last month, well above the 5.9 percent national average. 
 Republicans for two years have had a three-step process for luring black voters. Party workers in 13 key states first engage the voters, then try to build trust, and finally push them to vote. So far they say they’ve reached out to about 200,000 black voters. 
 Getting African-Americans to vote for anyone this year is clearly going to be difficult. Louisiana’s black share of the vote plunged from 29 percent in 2008 to 24 percent in 2010, and in Kentucky, it dropped from 11 percent to 6 percent. 
 Democrats figure they just have to break through with the kind of pointed message Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., chairman of the black caucus’ political action committee, offers. 
 “We have to convince people this is like voting in a presidential election,” he said.

 `Outside of the federal government's Bureau of Labor statistics, the Gallup polling organization also tracks the nation's unemployment rate. While the BLS and Gallup findings might not always perfectly align, the trends almost always do and the small statistical differences just haven't been worthy of note. But now Gallup is showing a sizable 30 day jump in the unemployment rate,  from 7.7% on July 21 to 8.9% today . 
 This is an 18-month high. 
 At the end of July, the BLS showed a  7.4% unemployment rate , compared to Gallup's 7.8%. Again, a difference not worthy of note. But Gallup's upward trend to almost 9% in just the last three weeks is alarming, especially because this is not a poll with a history of wild swings due to statistical anomalies. Gallup's sample size is a massive 30,000 adults and the rolling average is taken over a full 30 day period. 
 Gallup also shows an alarming increase in the number of underemployed (those with some work seeking more). During the same 30-day period, that number has jumped from 17.1% to 17.9%.

 Economy shows sudden drop: Obama wants swift action on taxes, gay marriage, illegal immigrants, but not jobs.

 GDP Shows Surprise Drop for US in Fourth Quarter 
 Published: Wednesday, 30 Jan 2013 | 8:11 AM ET 
 Getty Images 
 The U.S. economy posted a stunning drop of 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter, defying expectations for slow growth and possibly providing incentive for more Federal Reserve stimulus. 
 The economy shrank from October through December for the first time since the recession ended, hurt by the biggest cut in defense spending in 40 years, fewer exports and sluggish growth in company stockpiles. 
 The Commerce Department said Wednesday that the economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter. That's a sharp slowdown from the 3.1 percent growth rate in the July-September quarter. 
 The surprise contraction could raise fears about the economy's ability to handle tax increases that took effect in January and looming spending cuts. 
 Still, the weakness may be because of one-time factors. Government spending cuts and slower inventory growth subtracted a total of 2.6 percentage points from growth. 
 And those volatile categories offset faster growth in consumer spending, business investment and housing -- the economy's core drivers of growth. 
 Another positive aspect of the report: For all of 2012, the economy expanded 2.2 percent, better than 2011's growth of 1.8 percent. 
 The economy may stay weak at the start of the year because Americans are coming to grips with an increase in Social Security taxes that has left them with less take-home pay. 
 Subpar growth has held back hiring. The economy has created about 150,000 jobs a month, on average, for the past two years. That's barely enough to reduce the unemployment rate, which has been 7.8 percent for the past two months. 
 Economists forecast that unemployment stayed at the still-high rate again this month. The government releases the January jobs report Friday. 
 The slower growth in stockpiles comes after a big jump in the third quarter. Companies frequently cut back on inventories if they anticipate a slowdown in sales. Slower inventory growth means factories likely produced less. 
 Heavy equipment maker Caterpillar, Inc. said this week that it reduced its inventories by $2 billion in the fourth quarter as global sales declined from a year earlier. 
 The biggest question going forward is how consumers react to the expiration of a Social Security tax cut. Congress and the White House allowed the temporary tax cut to expire in January, but reached a deal to keep income taxes from rising on most Americans. 
 The tax increase will lower take home pay this year by about 2 percent. That means a household earning $50,000 a year will have about $1,000 less to spend. A household with two high-paid workers will have up to $4,500 less. 
 Already, a key measure of consumer confidence plummeted this month after Americans noticed the reduction in their paychecks, the Conference Board reported Tuesday. 
 Economists expected the first reading on gross domestic product to show growth of 1 percent, down from the third quarter's reading of 3.1 percent. 
 Obama axes Jobs Council 
 By Dave Boyer 
 
 
 
 The Washington Times 
 Thursday, January 31, 2013 
 
 ** FILE ** General Electric’s Jeffrey Immelt looks on as President Obama … 
 
 With more than 12 million Americans still out of work, President Obama has decided to shut down his Jobs Council. 
 The White House announced Thursday that Mr. Obama would not extend authorization for the council, which he created two years ago. Its authority expired Thursday, a day after the government reported that the economy contracted in the fourth quarter of 2012. 
 White House press secretary Jay Carney said Mr. Obama never intended the council to go beyond its original two-year mandate. He said the administration would “launch a new effort” to encourage business leaders to create more jobs. 
 Congressional Republicans said the petering out of the ineffective panel was typical of Mr. Obama’s weak record on job creation. 
 “To understand the abysmal nature of our economic recovery, look no further than the president’s disinterest in learning lessons from actual job creators,” said Brendan Buck, spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican. “Whether ignoring the group or rejecting its recommendations, the president treated his Jobs Council as more of a nuisance than a vehicle to spur job creation.” 
 Mr. Obama filled the panel with economists and business leaders such as General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt, with the intention of finding new ways to work with the business community to create jobs. But the councilinstead became a symbol of the administration’s inability to reduce unemployment significantly, and the group met in full only four times over two years, most recently in February 2012. 
 The nation’s unemployment has dropped from 9 percent to 7.8 percent since Mr. Obama formed the council, but there are still about 12.2 million people without jobs, with millions more either underemployed or leaving the labor force entirely.

 The Night before he appeared on UNIVISION, Obama gave network owner's wife a U.N. appointment. 
 Posted on  October 4, 2012October 4, 2012  by  mariomurilloministries 
   
 
 Hello friends, Today we say to our growing blog audience that Obama did not get you a job, but he did get one for a billionaire’s wife. How he did it is the stuff of penny ante dictators and why he did it should be a long overdue wake up call to Latino Christians. 
 According to the Politico blog, Haim Saban, owner of the television network, backed Hillary Clinton in 2008, but during the summer donated $1 million to groups supporting the campaigns of Democrats. And according to another blog in Spanish of Yahoo,  the appointment of Cheryl Saban to the diplomatic post was made last Wednesday, the day before Obama appeared at a forum at the University of Miami hosted by Univision. 
 Haim Saban, a billionaire businessman, took control of Univision in 2006 topping a bid made by media conglomerate Televisa of Mexico. 
 "Mrs. Saban has never worked in diplomatic posts but has been active in philanthropic and non-profit organizations such as CARE USA, Children's Network International, Mercy Corps, Plan USA," stated Yahoo, which said Haim Saban’s fortune is worth $3.6 billion and is listed by Forbes magazine as one of the 100 richest men in America. 
 Okay take a deep breath and consider the corruption of power you have just read. No one can call this an innocent coincidence. No one can deny the twin disasters this represents. 
 
 It is a corrupt and dangerous quid pro quo between a vast media outlet and the presidency. 
 Obama is abusing his power of diplomatic appointment to win the Latino vote. 
 There is a breathtaking arrogance of doing something this blatant. It shows how reckless he is with power. 
 
 Let me take this opportunity to plead with Latino Christians who still think Obama is for us to wake up. He does not care about us or our families. To abandon your Bible faith because you believe he will help your family members that are here illegally is naïve and hypocritical. He has had 4 years to fix immigration and seal the border, he has done nothing and he will do nothing. 
 Take another look at Obama…he has abandoned black Christians because he no longer needs them. He represents the liberal myths that have kept minorities victimized. Let’s not make Latinos the next victimized minority. We do not want food stamps, we want a paycheck. We cannot help our families if Obama crashes our economy. Again, do not leave your Christian convictions outside the voting booth.

 How to pray about Obama, Planned parenthood and the economy. 
 Posted on  June 1, 2012  by  mariomurilloministries 
   
  June 1, 2012 NEW YORK (AP) – “U.S. stock futures plummeted Friday after the release of a report on the job market that was far weaker than economists expected. Dow Jones industrial average futures, which fell 100 points before the report came out at 8:30 a.m. EDT Friday, tumbled an additional 100 points within minutes. A loss of 200 points when the stock market opens at 9:30 a.m. would wipe out what was left of the Dow's gain for the year. 
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note plunged to 1.46 percent, the lowest on record, from 1.56 percent. That was an indication that investors were flocking to bonds for safety.” 
 Experts predicted that we would see 150,000 jobs added in this report. But even 150,000 jobs added in one month is a terrible number. That is how much California should be adding let alone the whole nation. Instead, only 69,000 jobs were added and unemployment is back up to 8.2%. 
 This is a jobs disaster and under normal circumstances would kill a president’s reelection chances… but it will not. Why? 
 -When Obama ignored the economy for the first two years in order to ram through a health care bill that Democratic leaders did not read, that the Supreme Court said would totally change how our government relates to us, and that the vast majority of Americans hate, it did not have a lasting effect on his poll numbers. 
 
 His economic strategy is seen by some experts to be like using amputation to cure ingrown toenail. He gave Solyndra 500 million and it promptly filed for bankruptcy. He blocks a pipeline that most leaders say would create a million jobs. He continues blame George Bush 4 years later. Again, this did not crash his approval rating. 
 
 -When he came out in favor of same sex marriage it should have dropped his support from the black community, who overwhelmingly oppose it, but again he looks to get 95% of their vote. 
 
 More than 50% of all Americans oppose abortion on demand. His unwavering support for Planned Parenthood even after it was revealed that one of their workers was helping a woman plan for an abortion if she found out the fetus was a girl, has not cost him the support of woman’s rights groups. 
 
 Let me see if you got that one:  The ultimate violence against women is to kill them simply because they are a woman, and yet, woman’s rights movements will still back Planned Parenthood and their Obama. Planned Parenthood by the way, gets nearly $500 million of your tax dollars every year. 
 -A huge number admit in polls that Obama means to reshape America by ideology and by a personal malice for the American system, but they are going to vote for him anyway. 
 -An equal number agree that Obama cannot run on his record, but they will vote for him anyway. 
 
 Finally, there is the blackout on the historic news that the Catholic Church representing 25 million Americans is suing Obama for violating their freedom of worship. Franklin Graham has said that Obama has a resentment against Christians. Even so, many Christians are still going to vote for Obama . 
 
 So why after all of this is he still holding his approval rating? The answer should trouble even the most staunchly liberal thinkers among us. CBS, NBC, ABC, Hollywood, The New York Times, and a myriad of newspapers are doing everything possible to get Obama reelected. They are in lock step with him, they get their talking points from the White House, and make they sure that we only hear positives about a president who many believe is the worst, by far, in history. 
 This could also explain why you may not have heard of many of the issues I am raising. 
 Every day the hope of a free and fair election dims because of this vast bias that has the power to bend facts and outright lie in order to achieve their goals. We need a miracle. 
 What do we do? We pray, we pray like we have never prayed before. 
 1. We pray for a mass spell to be broken off of America.  Ezra 10:1 says, "Now while Ezra was praying, and while he was confessing, weeping, and bowing down before the house of God, a very large assembly of men, women, and children gathered to him from Israel; for the people wept very bitterly." The way that Ezra prayed was so intense that it broke the spell on the people. This is no time for pride or the fear of man. This is the time of fiery, heart-rending intercession! 
 2. We pray as priests of God confessing sins on behalf of our nation.  Daniel 9:3 Then I set my face toward the Lord God to make request by prayer and supplications, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes. 4 And I prayed to the Lord my God, and made confession, and said, “O Lord, great and awesome God, who keeps His covenant and mercy with those who love Him, and with those who keep His commandments, 5 we have sinned and committed iniquity, we have done wickedly and rebelled, even by departing from Your precepts and Your judgments.” Even though Daniel was innocent he still said, “we have sinned.” 
 3. We plead for mercy and for God to spare America.  Joel 2:13  “   Rend your heart and not your garments. Return to the Lord your God, for he is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love, and he relents from sending calamity. 14 Who knows? He may turn and relent and leave behind a blessing —grain offerings and drink offerings for the Lord your God.”  It is not too late and the fires of revival that we are seeing everywhere attest to God’s intention to spare us. 
 We dare not underestimate the powers that have are arrayed against us. This is a masterpiece of deception. However, we dare not forget the awesomeness of our God! He has exposed lies and deposed kings throughout history. Our greatest enemy is our apathy and our fear! Once the body of Christ stands where she belongs she will be unstoppable! ****
