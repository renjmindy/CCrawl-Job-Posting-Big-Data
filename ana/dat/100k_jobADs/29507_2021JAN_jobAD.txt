 The Wireless AI Innovation @ Verizon (WAIV) Team is seeking a unique data scientist capable of technical creativity and the ability to showcase their prototype work. This role will understand the cutting-edge concepts and capabilities of AI/ML and utilize them to create innovative enhancements to engineering tools not previously envisioned. They must be a strong communicator to win over Verizon’s brightest SMEs to new thinking and also process-minded to guide their assigned projects to completion. 
 The WAIV team is a fast-paced AI/ML team, prototyping software as operational Beta Proof of Concepts. The role will primarily be focused on data science, but will often take on all the lifecycle functions of an AI/ML prototype, from working with SMEs that translate, medium-scale data engineering, model training and testing, and installing the code into Verizon directional systems. Projects can be self-planned and executed, giving the structure and flexibility to innovate. As these projects are new inventions, the data science role will also be skilled at presenting and describing their works in written form. Publications are expected to be created in the form of internal blog posts, intellectual property, industry papers, conference presentations or collaborations with universities. 
 Responsibilities: 
 
 Envision new network (engineering) AI/ML projects and present well-formed ideas to the team. Utilize considerable creativity to merge ideation, knowledge of AI/ML model uses, insights from SMEs/translators and constraints to propose ML projects that are meaningful and actionable. 
 Provide timelines, milestones, project plans and types of AI/ML models to be attempted for new prototype projects. Adapt and communicate needed changes as datasets, labels or models may not function as expected. 
 Partner with team and non-team data scientists to teach complex concepts, assess project feasibility, select input features and validate project output. Envision and test for corner cases. 
 Utilize large amounts of GPU effectively to train and attempt multiple models, documenting progress. 
 Guide AI/ML projects with high autonomy so that they will be accepted by the business and SMEs who will use them. 
 Pull sample data sets from NS tools and VGRID to attempt prototypes on new topics. 
 Learn the wireless domain (5G/LTE, xLPT datasets, RF Planning, Orchestration, etc) and toolsets to better communicate and understand the needs of engineers for AI/ML automation. 
 Publish blogs, create documentation, perform presentations, submit intellectual property write-ups and lead efforts for external publications. 
 Present to SME groups such as the System Performance Core Team, the Assurance Core Team or Service Performance to explain, promote and request feedback on AI/ML project ideation and ongoing efforts. Support SMEs from WAIV when they present your work to engineers.
