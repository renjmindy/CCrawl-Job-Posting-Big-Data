 June 19, 2013April 30, 2015 by  Matthew Coppola - Career Coach, Employment Specialist and Professional CV Writer   3 Comments

 March 1, 2013April 30, 2015 by  Matthew Coppola - Career Coach, Employment Specialist and Professional CV Writer   1 Comment 
 The phrase “generation gap” implies that a great chasm exists between the old and the young, and that it must be immensely difficult to overcome.

 Don't Gossip at Work 
 March 1, 2013December 20, 2016 by  Matthew Coppola - Career Coach, Employment Specialist and Professional CV Writer 
 Let's face it. We all love a good gossiping session. We love to talk about what other people are doing or what they have done when it has nothing to do with us. It is what workers do when they have nothing better else to do or they are in a mindless job. Because they…

 Getting Angry at Work Just Isn't Worth It! 
 February 28, 2013April 30, 2015 by  Matthew Coppola - Career Coach, Employment Specialist and Professional CV Writer 
 oo many people are angry at work. Workplace violence is an extreme example. Even short of violence, every day you see managers and co-workers who are mad at each other, their co-workers, their employees, their bosses, their customers, the company, and the world itself. Anger interferes with teamwork and productivity. It also creates an environment…

 Why Your Goals Should Be S.M.A.R.T 
 February 19, 2013April 30, 2015 by  Matthew Coppola - Career Coach, Employment Specialist and Professional CV Writer 
 Establishing clear goals in writing is the responsibility of managers and their superiors, and of managers and their staff.

 Is It Good to Include a Summary for Each Employer you Worked for? 
 February 18, 2013April 30, 2015 by  Matthew Coppola - Career Coach, Employment Specialist and Professional CV Writer 
 In every resume there is a part of it set aside for employment history, this includes employer name, their email address, your job title, duration worked and job responsibilities and key achievements if applicable.
