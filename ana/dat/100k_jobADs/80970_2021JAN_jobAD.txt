 The Covenant with my eyes 
 July 26, 2012July 28, 2012  /  clawoflight  /  Leave a comment 
 Reading chapters 7 & 8 of EYMB, I heard about Job: 
 
 I made a covenant with my eyes not to look lustfully at a girl. 
Job 31:1 
 
 After further digging into this topic, I realized that this was what I had to do - so I did. I promised that my sin would stop from now on - down to every single little look. And than I prayed, brought this before GOD, and asked for his help in making this possible.
