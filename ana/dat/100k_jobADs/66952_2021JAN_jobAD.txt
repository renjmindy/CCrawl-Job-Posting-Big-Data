 Civil War  53 mins - "150 years ago, the Battle of Gettysburg – the bloodiest of the Civil War – was about to be fought. Thousands would lose their lives in that battle, northerners and southerners, joining the hundreds of thousands who had already laid down their lives in the course of the war. But why were so many prepared to take up arms in the first place? When most southerners were not slaveholders, and most northerners were not abolitionists, how had a war infused with the question of slavery even begun? In this second part of our special series on the Civil War, the Guys and their guests examine the inner conflicts and mixed motivations of most Americans, as they contemplated war against each other." At the link right-click "Download" and select "Save Link As" from the pop-up menu. 
 Educating the Underprivileged  8 mins - "…we are continuing our conversation with our education innovators. Still with us are Father Joe Parkes.

And Jessie Woolley-Wilson is CEO of  DreamBox Learning ." At the link right-click "Download" and select "Save Link As" from the pop-up menu. 
 Environmental Policy  51 mins - "Environmentalist  Mark Lynas  believes that nature no longer runs the Earth. We do. Managing an entire planet isn’t easy, but in his book, Lynas aims to show how humans can tackle this monumental task. In doing so, he disposes with the environmentalist playbook, arguing that to save Earth from ourselves, humans can, should and indeed must play God at a planetary level. He’ll join Doug to make his case for “jettisoning sacred cows” to solve the world’s gravest ecological problems. Mark Lynas is a journalist and environmental activist.

 Lego  51 mins - "Along with Coca-Cola, Apple and Disney, LEGO is among the world’s most recognized brands. The toy company annually produces its candy-colored plastic bricks at a rate more than five times the world’s population. And in 2000, Fortune magazine named LEGO the toy of the century. But the Danish company, which began in 1932 producing wooden cars and ducks, recently stood at the brink of bankruptcy. Facing a digital toy revolution and the new world of partnership and licensing agreements, it tried to re-invent itself. When standard innovation strategies fell short, LEGO found success by “returning to the brick.” Diane and her guest, David Robertson, discuss how LEGO conquered the toy industry." You can listen at the link, but not download; however, the file is included in the zip collection noted in the introduction to this episode. 
 Oil Pipeline  51 mins - "The State Department is preparing its final report on the environmental impact of the Keystone XL pipeline. In a speech last week, President Barack Obama tied his approval of the project to net carbon emissions. The president said, "our national interest will be served only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution." A number of analysts interpreted the speech as laying the groundwork for approval. Others are convinced the president was signaling his intended rejection. For this month's Environmental Outlook, Diane and her [3] guests discuss the proposed tar sands pipeline from Canada to the Gulf Coast." You can listen at the link, but not download; however, the file is included in the zip collection noted in the introduction to this episode.

 Sports Rules   61 mins - "Michael Munger of Duke University talks with EconTalk host Russ Roberts about the role of formal rules and informal rules in sports. Many sports restrain violence and retaliation through formal rules while in others, protective equipment is used to reduce injury. In all sports, codes of conduct emerge to deal with violence and unobserved violations of formal rules. Munger explores the interaction of these forces across different sports and how they relate to insights of Coase and Hayek." At the link find the title, "Munger on Sports, Norms, Rules, and the Code," right-click "Media files Mungersports.mp3″ and select "Save Link As" from the pop-up menu.
