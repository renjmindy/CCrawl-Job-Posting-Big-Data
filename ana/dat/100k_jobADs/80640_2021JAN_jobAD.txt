 WHAT WE DO. 
 Travelshopa is a privately held online community of exclusive local shops, local brands across fashion, gifts and homewares in the Asia Pacific region. We specialise in providing listings, reviews, tips and advice, and events about the local shopping scene. 
 With an aim to inform shoppers about where to find the best local designers and retailers, Travelshopa also provides local businesses with a platform where they can reach new customers and bring their brand to life. 
 WHO’S WHO. 
 Travelshopa was founded by Renée Lodens in 2012. Starting out as a blog, Renée has grown Travelshopa to be the first online community of its kind in less than a year. In 2012 Renée left a career in business development, marketing, project management, and event management in the ICT industry, and with an MBA in strategy and marketing in her back pocket, she embarked on starting her own business. Strong corporate experience married with intense passion for travel and a will to support local businesses enabled Renee to look for a refreshing new media that would appeal to the wants and needs of both consumers and businesses. And, Travelshopa was born. 
 The Travelshopa team also includes Amanda Vella (Account Manager) and Natalie Koh (Contributing Writer).
