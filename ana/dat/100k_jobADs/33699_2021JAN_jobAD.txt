 The strong turnaround in coal prices and increased demand for NSW coal from key export markets is delivering more coal mining jobs for New South Wales. 
 The most recent figures from Coal Services show there were just over 20 600 coal production jobs in New South Wales (NSW), Australia as of July this year - over 1300 more than the same period last year, and the highest number since March 2015. 
 Many of these new coal mining jobs are in the Hunter region, with over 1000 more local Hunter coal mining jobs than a year earlier, helping to boost the Hunter economy, particularly in mining communities such as Singleton and Muswellbrook. 
 The growth in NSW coal mining jobs is also good news for the more than 8000 businesses in the suburbs of Sydney and across the state which supply mining operations in NSW. 
 "There's been a sustained recovery in business conditions for coal mining in NSW over the last 18 months, with increased commodity prices delivering jobs in our coal mining regions," said Stephen Galilee, CEO of NSW Minerals Council. 
 "Our NSW coal mining communities have done it tough over the past few years, so this jobs boost mining is really good news for local economies," continued Galilee. 
 "Increasing demand for NSW coal means more NSW coal mining jobs. With the right policy settings that make the most of growing opportunities, our coal mining industry can continue to deliver employment, investment and economic stability well into the future," Galilee added.
