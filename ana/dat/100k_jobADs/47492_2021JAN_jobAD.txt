 Cron job has not been configured yet 
 __ May 29, 2018  __ Ataur Rahman  __ Leave a comment 
 Installation extension error 
 
PS D:\xampp\htdocs\magento2> php bin/magento setup:cron:run
∩╗┐#!/usr/bin/env php
setup-cron: Please check var/log/update.log for execution summary.
 
 You can see 
setup-cron.ERROR: Your current PHP memory limit is 328M. Magento 2 requires it to be set to 756M or more. As a user with root privileges, edit your php.ini file to increase memory_limit. 
 See if the following file exists: 
Magento install dir/var/.setup_cronjob_status 
If the file exists, cron has run successfully in the past. 
 magento-directory/setup/src/Magento/Setup/Controller/Environment.php 
 
commented out :
//$setupCheck = $this->cronScriptReadinessCheck->checkSetup();
//$updaterCheck = $this->cronScriptReadinessCheck->checkUpdater();

and replaced it with :
$setupCheck = ['success' => 1];
$updaterCheck = ['success' => 1];
