 WHAT OUR FANTASTIC USERS SAY 
 "Thank you for filling a niche at an affordable price. Your book was just what I was looking for: a great way to quickly and painlessly pass the ACLS and BCLS exams. I have looked for some time trying to find a good study aid like your books and haven’t had much success. Thanks for filling this niche!" 
 Jamie L. Dodgen 
 Staff development director 
 "I would actually like to take the time to thank you both. I was very pleasantly surprised with the level of detail about the AHA exams that you had in your books. I spent a few hours reading and studying your books and was impressed to say the least. In my job, I am expected to know this information and be able to recall it at a moment’s notice. Your books are an easy way for me to memorize the essential information and stay current. And your books helped me pass the certification exams on my first attempt! An excellent book at a very reasonable price. Thank you again." 
 Jorge P 
 Certified nursing assistant 
 "Michele and Joe – you have no idea how much you have helped me and how much time you have saved me. The question and answer with explanation format is the best way to study and remember the information. Your book made studying for the AHA certification exams a breeze. Thank you very much." 
 Andrea J. Cook 
 Sports book runner 
 "Michele’s book is very well done. The minute I started reading it, I knew it was exactly what I was looking for. I have studied for and taken the ACLS and BLS certification exam in the past – but I always had trouble memorizing all the essential information – even after the exam is over. This book is clear and concise and offers much more information than I expected. Thank you and I am looking forward to using your PALS book."
