  The Process Of Career Management  
 RedStarResume 
 April 13, 2013 
 Career management  refers to the planning, supervising, controlling, handling, coping and administrating one’s professional life. It comprehensively covers a detailed view of what you want to be, where you want to go, how you will get there and ultimately how long you intend to stay. All the answers are directly related to one’s personal goals and targets. Being able to handle  changes in your career  will best enable you to avoid mistakes of the past, prepare a confident approach to the present and a implement a positive direction for the future. Overall, managing your career will help maintain and develop your professional growth, development, and direction. 
 When Should I Begin To Manage My Career? 
 Successful career management can start as early as the first day you walk into school or college. You should clearly  identify your goals  before enrolling in a particular degree or course and preparing for a lifelong career. (This saves a lot of money and time later on down the track!) Be specific with what are you good at and what you enjoy doing; most importantly what you can see yourself doing every day going forward. Being able to answer these questions will help you in understanding yourself better and what areas you are most likely to succeed. If you find that you have made a mistake don’t panic. Exhaust your options, understand the value added skills that you have and how best you can utilise these existing skills. Don’t be afraid to ask questions. Ask yourself if you are capable of performing the task or if you see yourself progressing in a certain area. If the answer is yes, then begin your quest to achieving your targets. Never forget to network and seek out as many people and opinions as possible. You just never know where the next door will open. 
 How Long Does Career Management Last For? 
 Career management is a lifelong exercise. Balancing your work and social life is a juggling act. It is not just confined to one period in your life or a particular profession. In life many things change so don’t be afraid to change with the times. It is all about adaptability and learning. The ability to learn from every setback will make you smarter in making your next career move. The employment market may seem crowded and not promising, but being open to change will help you survive during those dark months. The changing times are not moments of despair, but rather moments of opportunity.
