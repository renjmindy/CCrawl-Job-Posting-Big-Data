 Career Steps 
 by  jenchuz 
 In just over a month, I will graduate from PwC's ACA training contract as a fully fledged chartered accountant. The last three years have truly been a great experience, a steep learning curve and an exciting time of growth. However I look forward to this next mile stone in my life and to the opportunities that lie ahead. 
 In true auditor style, I will document my attempts to apply and secure work overseas and I hope you are inspired by it! 
 Have a great week.
