 What is a dermatologist? 
 Dermatologists are medical practitioners who specialize in skin health. They examine patients with skin conditions and overview the progress of dermatological treatments. 
 What does a dermatologist do? 
 Dermatologists diagnose skin problems, from mild ones (e.g. sunburn) to severe ones (e.g. skin cancer). They conduct screenings and skin evaluations, and analyze the patients’ medical history to determine appropriate treatments. Dermatologists also oversee how effective the treatments are and refer patients to different specialists if needed. 
 Dermatologist duties include: 
 
 Diagnosing skin ailments 
 Advising on treatments and prescribing medication 
 Conducting non-invasive surgical procedures 
 
 There are different specializations in dermatology, such as pediatric dermatology, dermatopathology, etc. When crafting your own dermatologist job description, make sure to tailor responsibilities and requirements to the role’s required expertise and area of specialty.
