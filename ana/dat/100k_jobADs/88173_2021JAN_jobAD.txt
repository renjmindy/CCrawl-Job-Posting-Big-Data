  Negative Stuff Will Find You During Career Success  
 Bud Bilanich 
 December 05, 2011 
 Success Tweet : Stuff happens as you go about creating a successful life and career. Choose to respond positively to the negative stuff that happens.  It’s simple, really. Success is all up to you, and me, and anyone else who wants it. We all have to take personal responsibility for our own success. I am the only one who can make me a  career success . You are the only one who can make you a career success. Stuff happens: good stuff, bad stuff, frustrating stuff, unexpected stuff. Successful people respond to the stuff that happens in a positive way. Humans are the only animals with free will. That means we – you and me – get to decide how we react to every situation that comes up. That’s why taking personal responsibility for yourself and choosing to respond positively to the negative stuff that happens to you is so important. Personal responsibility means recognizing you are responsible for your life and the choices you make. It means you realize while other people and events have an impact on your life, these people and events don’t shape your life. When you accept personal responsibility for your life, you own up to the fact how you react to people and events is what’s important. And you can choose how to react to every person you meet and everything that happens to you. The concept of personal responsibility is found in most writings on success. Stephen Covey’s first habit in the  7 Habits of Highly Effective People  is, “Be proactive.” I have a little book called,  Daily Reflections for Highly Effective Peopl  e also by Stephen Covey. It is one of the most read books I have. I like it because it provides a little snippet of advice from  7 Habits of Highly Effective People...  everyday. The reflection below goes directly to the advice in this tweet, and it gets to the heart of personal responsibility and life and career success. 
 
 “It’s not really what happens to us, but our response to what happens to us that hurts us. Of course, thing can hurt physically or economically and can cause sorrow. But our character, our basic identity, does not have to be hurt at all. In fact, our most difficult experiences become the crucibles that forge our character and develop the internal powers, the freedom to handle difficult circumstances in the future and to inspire others to do so as well.” 
 
 Dr. Covey provides some great  career advice  here. We can’t always choose what happens to us, but we can choose how we react to both the positive and negative experiences we have as we go through life. Successful people choose to make lemonade out of lemons. Unsuccessful people choose to complain about the bitter, tart taste of the lemons they are handed. I know the “lemons into lemonade” line is a cliché. However, clichés become clichés because they have an underlying truth. The important point is that human beings are blessed with free will. As such, we can choose what we do and how we react to the world around us. We can choose a positive, productive path; or we can choose a path of self pity and inaction – and hurt only ourselves in the end. The career advice from another one of his reflections carries on in the same vein… 
 
 “Proactive people can carry their own weather with them. Whether it rains or shines makes no difference to them. They are value driven; and if their value is to produce good quality work, it isn’t a function of whether the weather is conducive to it or not.” 
 
 I love the concept of carrying your own weather with you. Choosing to react positively to the negative people and events in your life is the best way to carry your weather – and to take personal responsibility for your life and career success. The common sense career success coach point here is clear. Successful people know that they can choose how they respond to everyone they meet and everything that happens to them. They know “the devil made me do it” is never an accurate statement. They also know no one can “make” them mad. In short, they follow the advice in Tweet 32 in  Success Tweets  , “Stuff happens as you go about creating a successful life and career. Choose to respond positively to the negative stuff that happens.” If you want to create the career success you deserve, remember Stephen Covey’s advice. Carry your weather with you. In this way, whether it rains or shines, on the outside, it will be sunny on the inside. Choose to react positively to the negative people you meet, and the negative things that happen to you. When you do, you’ll find less negative things happening and fewer negative people entering your life.
