 AN INTERNATIONAL MARINE SCIENCE CAREER? 
 ROYAL NIOZ SCIENTISTS COLLABORATE IN MULTINATIONAL RESEARCH PROJECTS 
 The Royal NIOZ is a Dutch research institute with a global science scope, working together with a growing number of universities and marine research institutes around the globe. It 's a great way for our employees to expand their research network. Are you our next research international? 
 If the oceans are without borders, why should marine science? Marine scientists at the Royal NIOZ contribute to a growing number of international science projects. Via our close cooperation with Utrecht University, collaborations with several other Dutch and international universities and institutes, but also as a result of our outstanding science record, NIOZ scientists increasingly work within cross-border, co-scientific projects funded by European associations and transnational science conglomerates. 
 Marine internationals 
 The growing presence of Royal NIOZ in international research projects like 'VORTEX' and 'MICROLIPIDS' (funded by the European Research Council), and the EU Project 'MERCES' is signaling the widening scope of inter-organizational networks, but also indicates the next generation marine scientists may turn into true "internationals". Changing the scenery to create better scientific results and build stronger international relationships. 
 31 nationalities 
 At the Royal NIOZ, 31 nationalities are working closely together in fathoming the secrets of estuaries, seas, and oceans. PhD's, postdocs and senior scientists that are ambassadors of NIOZ research excellence, connecting with overseas colleagues, sharing new views and advancing science projects through cooperation. Currently, over 40 NIOZ scientists are working on international research projects.
