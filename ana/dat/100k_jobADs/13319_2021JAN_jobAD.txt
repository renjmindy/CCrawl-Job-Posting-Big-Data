 Life Of A Career Woman : The Probationary/Learning Period 
 May 18, 2020May 17, 2020 Yuvathi Leave a comment 
 Every company/organization has a certain probationary or training period. It comes with the job role. For complex work, it could be a year. It doesn't matter if you are a fresh graduate at your first job or an experienced professional on a new role, there is a certain learning period for every job role. 
 One thing we all tend to do is  rush the process . We want to create a great first impression as a quick learner/ great employee / team player / manager and so we end up trying to hurry and skim through the learning period. This does no good. So  DON 'T . 
 The first year at a new job role is crucial.  It is time for you - not just to impress but to learn and adapt. Some jobs require less than a year. So work it out accordingly. 
 Life Of A Career Woman : The Probationary/Learning Period 
 **The Learning Phase / Probationary Period - Dos & Don'ts : ** 
 
 Take your time. Learn everything in detail as much as you can. Ask for tips and tricks that only seasoned seniors would know due to their vast experience in the job role. 
 Be a sponge. Observe, absorb, assimilate. 
 Keep notes. Maintain a learning journal or tracker. List the topics you want to learn more about and research. 
 Make mistakes and learn from them. (Avoid blunders - remember you are still a temp, so a blunder could cost your job.) 
 Don 't  try to  justify  your mistakes. Admit your mistakes and let your boss/team know that you are willing to learn and improve. 
 Don't give excuses for your inefficiency or lack of knowledge. Work on it. Action speaks louder. 
 Don't exaggerate or show off your skills yet. Be humble. This a period for you to establish a good foundation and develop a rapport; your time to shine will come eventually. 
 Be open & honest about what you know and don't know. This will allow you to ask questions to your colleagues and learn more in detail. 
 
 
 This is not only time for your boss, team and the organization to determine if you are right for the job but it is also the time for you to figure out if this is the right job role for you. 
 
 So, make full use of it. Trust the process. Don't rush it. Enjoy your learning phase as you will have a lot to prove for years to come! 
 Be Ambitious. Be Consistent. Be Brave.
