 |  |   Jobs as Park Manager 
 
 Yes, and yes. 
 Campground and RV park owners who are looking to hire active managers expect to pay a fair wage. You will find compensations packages that include a variety of benefits. Some include an RV site. However, it is not uncommon for a full-time manager to live away from the campground or RV park. 
 Employers typically hire one person for one position. When they hire couples, each spouse usually has a separate position. 
 You'll find that some parks look for a workamping couple. Oftentimes, this is so one person can do maintenance or other outside work and one can do office or other inside work. If the park is looking for volunteer workampers, they may prefer to have two people work for one site.

 Workers On Wheels is our website and newsletter about working while RVing -- working while living in a home on wheels. There are so many kinds of work to do while RVing and camping (what some campers call workcamping or work camping). We help RV workers -- whether snowbirds or full-time RVers -- find campground jobs, volunteer jobs, jobs with RV spaces, seasonal jobs, mobile employment, short-term paid employment, and other ways to earn an income and cut expenses while enjoying life in a recreational vehicle. Thanks for visiting our WOW website! ~ Jim, your Workers On Wheels editor, at work-for-RVers-and-campers.com
