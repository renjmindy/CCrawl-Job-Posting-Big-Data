 WSM Re-Opens Wheaton American Job Center at New Location 
 Earlier this week, we officially moved the Wheaton American Job Center (AJC) to its new location at 11510 Georgia Avenue. On Wednesday, we held a ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate the grand re-opening of the new space. 
 The ceremony included opening remarks by Ellie Giles, CEO of WSM. “A while ago, I realized we needed to make the bold move of getting out of our old Job Center–where it had been located for 25 years,” Giles said, “After much research, data collection, site visits, and the help of so many partners we decided that this new location was best for customers and the community.” The new location is approximately one-quarter mile from the Wheaton Metro Station and just down the street from the recently renovated Wheaton Library and Community Recreation Center. 
 Ted Rose, WSM Board Chair, Jim Rzepkowski, Assistant Secretary, Division of Workforce Development and Adult Learning, Maryland Department of Labor, and Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich also contributed with remarks. “You’re in the heart of new Wheaton and this place is going to be something special. This may be the most centrally located place in the County. We know this area has great potential,” Elrich said. “This is about bringing job seekers to a place where a range of opportunities are available to them.” 
 County Councilmember At-Large Hans Riemer presented a proclamation on behalf of the County Council congratulating WSM on the new location. Riemer added, “This team is a big part of the economic development and workforce development strides we are taking in Montgomery County. Wheaton is booming. The brand new Wheaton Library and Rec Center down the street is seeing 2,500 visitors per day. It is so great to see the growth and life in this community, and this job center is perfectly positioned to be part of that.” 
 As of October 31, 2019, the new AJC is officially open to the public, old and new customers! Read more detail about our plan to move and what to expect in the new space in our previous blog post  here .
