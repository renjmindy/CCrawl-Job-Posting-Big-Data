 Workday Career Accelerator Program 
 Break down barriers to careers in tech. 
 For veterans, the shift from military to civilian careers can prove difficult. But with the Workday Career Accelerator Program (CAP), a four-month paid program, veterans get the training needed to launch a successful career in technology, with the potential to convert to full-time employees at Workday.­ 
 We’re proud to say that 80 percent of our CAP alumni hold permanent Workday roles, spanning across functions from software engineering to quality assurance and more. 
   
 
 Getting a door open for you and then proving your self-worth is really one of those things where we can maximize human potential.
