 Hello, 
 Does a part of my simple speech sound good to native speakers? 
Perhaps you would say it in other way?! 
 ...During my studies at University I realized that i had chosen a wrong career. 
I didn't like law at all. I was interested in trade more. 
So when i graduated from the University i found a job in an advertising agency as a sales manager. And in that way my sales career started.

 It's understandable although it's probably smoother to say, "And that's the way my sales career started/began" if it's being used as a summary at the end of your story.
