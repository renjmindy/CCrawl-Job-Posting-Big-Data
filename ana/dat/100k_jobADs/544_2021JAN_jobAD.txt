  Blacklisted For This Job Search Mistake [Infographic]  
 J.T. O'Donnell 
 October 31, 2012 
 A new survey came out just in time for  Halloween  – and it's scaring a lot of long-term job seekers. If you've been looking for work and feel like you've been "blacklisted" by employers – you could be right. Forty-three percent of recruiters say they would consider blacklisting candidates who apply for jobs they aren't qualified for. They do so by suppressing your name in future talent searches. 
 
 Are You Guilty? If So, You Need a New Gameplan 
 I've worked with a lot of job seekers, especially, the long-term unemployed. One  job search mistake  I see them make is failing to properly strategize. In short, they are doing a lot of activities they think they should be doing, when in reality, their approach is ineffective and producing zero results. The worst part is that the longer they fail at looking for work, the harder getting hired becomes. Check out this infographic, and then join me to design your blueprint for success. 
 Your Next Step - FREE Webinar 
 Are you one of the millions of Americans who has surpassed the nine-month national average for job search? Then it's time to throw out the old and bring in the new.  It's time to get back to work!  Join me for a breakdown of what's not working in your job search. In this powerful session, I explain: 
 
 Why you need to stop looking for a job in order to find work. 
 How to remove the stigma of unemployment. 
 Where the real jobs are and how you can find them. 
 
 Fact:  Nobody is ever taught in school how to job search. As a result, the average American is ill-prepared to conduct a productive job search when the time comes. And, if you were laid-off or fired from your last job, you are starting from a place where you lack confidence in your ability to sell employers on your value. It's time to break the cycle of ineffective job search tactics and get some innovative, fresh perspective on how you can get back to work. Don't miss this info-packed session! WATCH FREE WEBINAR ►
