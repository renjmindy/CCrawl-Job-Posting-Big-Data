 ADP “New Job First Year” 
 ADP — a leading global provider of Human Capital Management solutions — came to us with with a simple conundrum: the world knew them only as the payroll company with the nifty, red logo on the corner of paystubs. As we dove into their business, it became abundantly clear that their offering was far more than the perception. They were a company that truly understood every great company’s greatest asset: its people. That led to a new tagline for the brand — A MORE HUMAN RESOURCE — along with print, social and a :60 web video launching the new and improved ADP. The goal: to celebrate the human element in the workplace and the role that ADP plays in that.
