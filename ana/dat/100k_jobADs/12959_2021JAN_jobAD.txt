 Pepper-spraying pig goes global 
 Updated below (on Tuesday, November 22, 2011) 
 So after  his fascistic actions on Friday , already University of California at Davis Police Lt. John Pike is an Internet sensation, now known  around the world  as the “Pepper-Spraying Cop." I would call him the “Pepper-Spraying Pot-Bellied Pig," but “Pepper-Spraying Cop"  is  more succinct. 
 Here are some images from the growing collection at  http://peppersprayingcop.tumblr.com/ : 
 
 Poor Cindy Lou! (Seasonal, though.) 
 
 I never liked the sanctimonious Tim Tebow. The Pepper-Spraying Cop would never pepper-spray someone like Tim Tebow, though. I mean, Tebow  is  a right-wing white male. 
 
 
 PETA will be on it. 
 
 Well, he  is  one of our  stormtroopers  … 
 
 He always plays the villain… 
 
 It was  sad  when  King Kong  died. 
 
 Hey, he  asked  her to move. 
 A little more political. (And pretty much what our liberty has come to.) 
 
 Wait -- that's a  real  photo, isn't it? 
 
 And that one, too? 
 
 The mystery is finally solved… 
 
 Bush always  was  overprotected. 
 
 Jesus suffered  a lot  on his way to the cross. 
 
 Even God isn't safe. 
 This one, I think, is my favorite, for its political content (and its technical quality): 
 
 And the first runner-up (this one via  Joe. My. God. ): 
 
 (Click  here  for larger version.) 
 My third runner-up (from  a  Washington Post  blog ). 
 If I knew PhotoShop, I think that I'd do one of the "Pepper-Spraying Cop" as WALL-E floating around in outer space, using his pepper-spray canister to propel himself. (Would he  have  to hit Eva in the face with his pepper spray, though?) 
 On a serious note, Lt. Pig -- er,  Pike  -- has been placed on administrative leave, as has the UC Davis Police chief. Hopefully they will get more than a slap on the wrist. Hopefully, they will be sued and lose. 
 In other news,  First Lady Michelle Obama was booed at her appearance yesterday at a NASCAR event  -- because her appearance delayed their traditional cross-burning. (Seriously, though, even uber-dipshit George W. Bush knew to appear only before receptive -- that is, wingnutty -- audiences.) 
 Update (Tuesday, November 22, 2011):  Here are more from  http://peppersprayingcop.tumblr.com/ . I love this shit, and I think it's great that one 1-percent-protecting cop's appalling, Nazi-like behavior against non-aggressive young people can be turned into  humor.  That is, I think, one of the strengths of the left: our ability to turn the right wing's most appalling actions into humor. (Indeed, the wingnuts' rare attempts at humor are pathetic.) 
 
 It's a wonderful life, indeed. 
 
 
 Damn hippies  deserve  it! 
 This one might be my new favorite: 
 
 Waldo  clearly  was resisting.
