  Searching For A Job While You're Still Employed  
 Lindsay Robinson 
 December 11, 2014 
 In this episode of Career Lab, J.T. shows you how to search for a job even though you're still employed.  NOTICE: 
 
 Big (exciting!) things are coming in 2015 on CAREEREALISM. We've been working hard to develop something that is going to knock your socks off. To get it done, we need to go underground for a bit. So, Career Labs won't be back on-air until mid-January. 
 We promise to notifiy you when we are live again - and when we do, you are going to be blown away! 
 Happy Holidays from all of us at CAREEREALISM TV! Topic suggestions, comments, feedback, please send them to support@workitdaily.com Weâ€™d love to hear from you.
