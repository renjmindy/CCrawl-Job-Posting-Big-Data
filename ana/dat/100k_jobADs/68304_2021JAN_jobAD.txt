 Joe Biden 2012 Chains You Can Believe In 
 Chains you can believe in - Joe Biden 2012. The office of the Vice Presidency hit a new low with Biden's racist remark “They're going to put y'all back in chains.” Say it ain't so, Joe. Hope and chains, huh. 
 Is this the new Obama/Biden 2012 campaign slogan, Hope and Chains? Chains you can believe in. 
 Biden's racist comment drew immediate criticism from the Republican Party with Mitt Romney telling Barack Obama to take his campaign of division, anger and hate back to Chicago. 
 Racism is alive and well in the Democratic Party. Joe Biden 2012 working on the chain gang. Chains you can believe in.

 Club Fed Secret Service 
 Club Fed or Pley Club is clearly the biggest scandal in Secret Service history. 
 Eleven Secret Service Agents in Cartagena, Colombia for the Summit of the Americas, were sent back to the United States after alleged misconduct involving prostitution. 
 Prostitution is legal in Colombia in designated “tolerance zones.” 
 All 11 agents who put the secret in service are accused of involvement in the incident by either interfering in the investigation or direct participation in other alleged misconduct. 
 Pley Club and Hotel Caribe - We all know the story of how do you make a hormone. Not pay her. 
 A disputed $170 bill brought down the Agency. 
 “ One of the agents did not pay one of the prostitutes and she complained to the police.” - Ronald Kessler, former Washington Post reporter

 Pimp Rush Limbaugh Sandra Fluke Slut 
 Pimp Rush Limbaugh has called Georgetown law student Sandra Fluke, a Slut and a Prostitute. 
 Limbaugh's controversial statements left out the word Whore. Fluke said she was stunned at first and like most women, outraged. 
 The talk show giant said that the 3rd year law student Fluke must essentially be paid to have sex, so what does that make her? 
 “ It makes her a slut, right? A prostitute. She wants to be paid to have sex!” - Rush Limbaugh 
 “ She [Fluke] wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to have sex. What does that make us? We're the Pimps!” - Rush Limbaugh

 $16 House Adverse Possession 
 Kenneth Robinson has left the $300,000 home in Flower Mound, Texas that he had lived in the past 7 months for $16, after a Texas judge ruled Monday in favor of the current lienholder Bank of America. 
 After the owner abandoned the foreclosure property and the original mortgage company went out of business, Robinson shrewdly submitted a $16 filing fee at the local courthouse eight months ago. 
 The law of "adverse possession" gave Kenneth Robinson the right to occupy the home he did not own or pay rent for. 
 He even wrote an eBook and created a website named 16dollarhouse.com in which he claimed he had the right to live in a $300,000 home by way of adverse possession. 
 “ I am successful because I can see it no other way.” - Kenneth Robinson
