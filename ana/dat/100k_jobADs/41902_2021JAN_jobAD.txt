 Dear Readers, 
 
 I recently used the services of  www.just-eat.ie , so I could place my  take away order on line 
 and pick it up at the take away a while later ( or get it delivered for an extra charge) 
 
 In their most recent email they mentioned they are hiring. 
 Check out the below Blog link with more information!
