 Welcome to Thantyr - Cover Reveal for The Opseti Guard 
 Welcome to Thantyr 
 
 Map designed by Ellie Mack 
 As the southernmost region of Nebeth, Thantyr is known for being the home of the dragon council themselves. The Treaty of Dragons series follows a group called The Opseti Guard through their journey to renew the bonds between dragons and humans alike. 
 In the first installment to the nine-book series, you see not only the fall of the beloved dragon council but the creation of The Opseti Guard themselves. You are taken on a journey of friendship and defining adventures. They learn not only to work as a team, but how what their own strengths are. You will see how they grow through the hardships that they face as well. 
 So, with that in mind, welcome to Thantyr. 
 May you always find joy in the journey, even when it is hard. 
 The first novel along this journey is, The Opseti Guard 
 Today, I get the honor to bring to you for the first time -  The cover reveal for The Opseti Guard!

 The Treaty of Dragons is in danger. 
 Dragon after dragon are showing up in the infirmary injured to the point of near death. Their supposed valiant riders are claiming it as nothing more than battle wounds. During a time when Thantyr seems at peace, this draws more than a little attention. Especially, when a healer named Renna Alder can connect to the dragons on a deeper level. She sees flashes and bits of what they’ve been through and it sends her into a rage. 
 No longer able to sit by idly and accept that all they can do is fight to keep the dragons alive, she disguises herself as a transfer student named Elas. Under this pretext, she joins the dragon rider school to investigate what really is happening to these dragons. However, what she discovers is something far darker and more sinister than she ever could imagine. 
 Can Renna find a way to save the dragons before she falls to a similar fate? Or has she discovered more than she can handle?

 Meet Misty: 
 
 Misty Harvey loves writing spine-tingling horror or dark fantasy novels sure to thrill readers. The psychology behind such tales has always been a fascination for her since she was younger. Even to the point that she once contemplated taking up psychology as a profession. Still, her love resides in the art of storytelling. An art she wishes to continue to share with readers for the rest of her days. 
 After climbing out of her writing cave and searching the house for the sound of the latest creak or pop, Misty can be found doing one of many things. Often, she spends the remainder of her day with her amazingly supportive husband and youngest daughter. While she has two older children that are out there spreading their wings around the world, including giving her a few grandchildren. 
 Her favorite things to do when not writing are crafts, wrestling with her dog, avoiding her cat’s bite or generally making her husband and daughter crazy. Often, she can be found creating vivid tales with her daughter about whatever mundane thing happened in their day and turning it into a crazy story. She is also an avid gamer, crochet goddess (we shall pretend there), domestic queen, and animal tamer (it’s a work in progress).

 Research Pitfalls 
 I got a brilliant new idea. (See video from 2/5/19 post) However, I don't really know enough about the subject to write a believable story. I would be willing to bet that you know what my time has been spent on the past few days, right? 
 Yep, research. Google can be an amaze-balls tool or a dangerous chasm of unhelpful information that never ends. Have you ever followed the search to those pages listed at the bottom? 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . 18? Talk about falling through a rabbit hole. 
 To be honest, most of the time I stick to the first page because those are the closest to my search words. If I don't find what I want, I change my search words. This time, I clicked through the pages, finding the most helpful site on page 6. 
 I saved it to my bookmarked pages so that I can go back and reference it when I need it. More helpful than any site however was my friend. She answered questions I had, explained some terminology that I didn't understand and walked me through the various forms of magic, witchcraft, spells, and all things witchy. At least I understand enough to get me started and I will check back with her frequently. it helps that she is one of my beta readers so this time around, she will be my alpha reader and my consultant. 
 It's more enjoyable to converse with someone who understands the subject you are interested in than visiting a static website. Live interaction trumps dry research any day. I wish we lived closer, although she would probably tire of me wanting to come over for coffee and talk her ear off daily. 
 I know several authors who have gleaned their information from people rather than researching online. Also, vice versa. There are a few pitfalls when you rely solely on the internet or on books. Real life implementation of the topic may not actually be the same as documented. For instance, if you are doing a police procedural and you are basing your story on what you've seen on TV, you could be way off. 
 All I need to do now is reference a book of shadows. I happen to know where I can get my hands on one, then I will be discussing it with my consultant. 
 How do you like to do your research? Do you think research is an important part of writing? Leave a comment below and click like, if you like this post!

 What's Going on In Your Neck of the Woods? 
 Forgive me, readers, it's been weeks since my last confession. I mean blog post. Well, sometimes they are about the same thing. 
 At the beginning of each year, I make plans. Often, big plans! One of those plans was to get back to regularly posting. If I could figure out how to get onto my blog from my tablet, it would speed things up tremendously. Sometimes I am technically inept. I'll figure it out eventually. 
 My husband is an  IT  guy. A code monkey. Name the electronics, he masters it. He writes in SQL all day at work. I was lost back in the day when I had to use Fortran and Cobol. Yes, I'm showing my age but oh well. 
 Until I have the time, ( cackles hysterically  time, as in extra time - a delusional thought that most authors fantasize about) I'll keep coming back to the laptop to enter my posts. Now that I've met my deadline for the anthology, I can return to a more manageable writing schedule. Well, more manageable for me anyway. 
 My friend Vicki Locey is like a writing machine. She doesn't use any dictation aids, she just plugs away every day at her writing while managing a small farm. I don't know how she does it. Other author friends have to juggle their home life, some with jobs whether part time or full time outside the home and still manage to crank out the books. 
 OK, a year ago I would have been stressed to the max over that, but not anymore. It is what it is and if nothing else, I've learned over the past year that I have to put blinders on to what "Other authors" do and DO what I can do.  PERIOD!  So, let's do a little catch-up, shall we? Since I've been in absentia, maybe one or two of you have wondered where I disappeared. You did, right? Right? 
 January  I had big plans! Some, I realize are on the dream level because if you never aim for the stars, you won't ever clear the trees. I was super focused on decluttering our home and preparing to move closer to my husband's work. We did great on that, taking several carloads full of plunder to Goodwill. The estimated dollar value for all of the stuff we removed from our home - $3500. Yes, you read that right. Between clothing, (mostly mine in larger sizes that I am proud to say no longer fit!) furniture, small appliances, children's toys that somehow got stored in a corner of the basement, and a plethora of knick-knacks. I should mention that our kids are adults now. I was shocked to find that we still had toys from their grade school years. 
 Just a word of advice - if you are planning to make donations to a charity, if you limit the donation amount to under $500, you are less likely to be audited. We wrote off most of the stuff because I doubt that we are going to be able to itemize anyway. 
 The house was looking better, after each purge we let the dust settle, literally. Had to give a day or two between sessions because the dust aggravated the sinuses. Then we found the shop vac - and began to be more proactive. 
 One shocking bit of purge - books. I know, I know, y'all are shocked. I got rid of over 100 books. A few of those were my books from college, my husband's books from college, reference books, and many old novels. I kept my first edition copies, despite the hubs protests. 
 February  - decluttering continued but I was more focused on writing. Value of things hauled out of our home to Goodwill or set on the curb with a sign - FREE estimated at $2600. (Not that I'm bragging if anything it's embarrassing to admit how much stuff I didn't need that I purchased with retail therapy over the years.) I had two anthology submissions to have in by the beginning of April. The doctor appointments, weekly therapy for lymphedema and aquasize classes kept me more than busy and by the time I got home from the aquacise classes and the therapy, I was drained. My stamina is greatly improved since radiation treatments, but I'm still not there yet.Fatigue is a very real issue. 
 I spent the majority of the month writing  The Blood Key  for the 12 Realms Fantasy Anthology while I worked out a plot line for my short novella for the Cancer Research anthology. Then I went gangbusters on that one. More about this in a bit. 
 March  - this is where the train comes to a screeching halt while our lives are derailed. Things were going well. We were making progress on the house. We could start renovations mid-March if we kept going at the same pace. 
 March 12 - 16, our oldest daughter was home for Spring Break. She didn't get to go to Ft. Lauderdale or anywhere cool because she had doctors appointments, dentist appointments, and had to get her regular scheduled auto work done. While home she told us her big plans for the following school year, which were quite frankly ridiculous. Her plans were to move back in with us and commute every day. Now, that may not sound like a problem except that the commute would be an hour and forty minute drive one way, every day, to and from. That's three hours on the road on a highway that semis use regularly. Sometimes she works late hours. 
 Being a mom, I was terrified! _What if the semis push her little car around and she has an accident? What if she is so tired that she falls asleep driving? What if she starts skipping classes because she 's tired of driving????? _ 
 The following week I spent a day researching available apartments in Cape. I set up appointments for the next day when she would be available to go see them. We viewed 14 apartments in about four hours. They ranged from roach motel to the Bates Motel, to meh, to College Life Resort center. Obviously, we didn't want her to be in the roach motel, and we couldn't swing the Resort. 
 So, our plans for renovations are on hold for a while so that we can help her finish to get her degree. Our plans to move closer to his work are on hold because, . . . well, moving costs money. There are closing costs, moving expenses and we have decided that our daughter's safety is more important. 
 This put a big kink in the writing for a few days, so then I was back at it like gangbusters when I got news that the 12 Realms Fantasy anthology was canceled.  SIGH 
 I'll take  The Blood Key  and work on it some more, develop it more. 15,000 words were limiting, I was just getting warmed up at 10,000! Now I can put in some of those scenes I had in my mind. It will have to be worked into the schedule for writing though as it's been pushed from top priority to about fifth down the pipeline. 
 Now the good news!  Break Line  is complete! Cover Reveal for the anthology, next week! 
 
 I thought things were getting back on track and then . . . hospital. People need to stop getting sick and hurting themselves! I've been to the hospital more times than I can count over the past few weeks. 
 Life always throws you a curve ball when things are going smooth, and sometimes the ball machine goes haywire and throws out multiple balls when you're already under the gun! 
 For now, things are calm and I'm back to writing or rather revisions.  Valkyrie 's Curse  has been on my desk for a while, a couple of years. In 2016, I did revisions on it and realized that it wasn't a complete story. Back to the drawing board.  Valkyrie 's Curse: The Awakening  is in revisions again. This time I'm checking my grammar before sending it off to my alpha. The release date for this one will be in a couple months, I'll have more of a set date next week. 
 So, now you know what I've been up to. There was a funeral, sickness, and dealing with anxiety all thrown in the mix as well. More about the anxiety at a later post but for now, I need to get a couple more chapters done for today. 
 What's going on in your neck of the woods? 
 Thanks for stopping by! Write on my friends, write on!

 MFRW blog hop week 51 - Advice for new authors.  Just one more week to go! 
 What advice would you give newbies? What advice do you wish that others would have given you when you were a newbie? 
 Those are the two main questions that I 've been contemplating for this post. I have to admit, it took a bit of contemplating to decide which tidbits to share. A couple of pots of coffee, a few oatmeal cookies - sugar-free of course, to dunk in my coffee, and my trusty notepad to jot down what came to my mind. 
 
 These are the three bits of advice that I wish someone would have shared with me. I hope it helps you if you are an aspiring author. 
 
 Decide what you want to write.  What genre do you feel comfortable with? What length of work do you feel comfortable with? 
 
 There are other options for a writer besides book-length novels. When I first began writing, I wrote articles for magazines, and for a column in our local paper. The short 1000 word articles rolled off my fingers with minimal effort. But, my dream was to be a published author like my idol Katie McAlister. It is difficult to make myself focus on longer length works, but oh so satisfying to hit 'the end'. 
 2.  Schedule time for your writing.  Make it a priority. If you write whenever you have time, you'll find everything in the world crowding out your writing time. Make an appointment with yourself and KEEP IT! Just as if it were a doctor's appointment. IF this is what you really want, then make your goals a priority! 
 3.  Stick to one project at a time!  (Best advice I ever got from my friend Vicki Locey! Thank you, Vicki!) I'm the world's worst at having too many irons in the fire, with multiple books in the works. It wasn't until I made myself focus on one project and stick with it to completion that I got my books published. Notice, that completed does not mean published. I have five books that are completed but need revisions and editing before they are publishable. It's ok to jot down ideas for new stories while you work on your current WIP.  FOCUS  is a key factor to success as an author. I have to admit my ADD tendencies fight me on this point. I made myself a system of rewards for tackling the current WIP first, before anything else. For instance, when I have my writing time, lately has been in the afternoons because of doctor appointments, I set my timer, and write until the timer goes off. Now I may get up and get a cup of coffee or cocoa, or run to the bathroom, but during that time I write. Most days I manage about 1200 words. Then I reward myself. Maybe it's coloring in my planner, it's one of those adult coloring book planners. Maybe I play a game for a bit or jot down notes for another story. If time allows or if I am really in the zone, I may work on writing for a longer period of time. 
 If you can master those three things, you are well on your way to success!

 Lamentations and Ecclesiastes 
 
 Breast Cancer awareness ribbons 
 Have you ever hit that point where you feel everything in your life is meaningless? The goals that you set for yourself seem like chasing the wind? Have you ever wondered what's the point, when for all of your hard work, anxiety, stress, and aggravation that finish line seems elusive or when you cross it, it's a day late and a dollar short? There has to be more to life than this, right? 
 I tip my hat to those men and women who continue in their daily roles after getting the diagnosis of cancer. The initial shock hit me hard. Making the decision for surgery seemed like a no brainer to me, I mean if there is cancer in my body - then get it out! 
 My blood pressure was the highest it has ever been the day I went in for surgery. I had never had a surgery before minus oral surgery which isn't the same at all. Of course, Mother Nature thought it was funny to have major flooding in the area to cut off the major highways between us and the hospital. That had its own share of aggravation, but we managed it. It did mean, however, the day of the surgery I had one person in my corner to be there with me through all of it. My husband is a saint! He has been amazing through all of this, has been encouraging, loving, supportive and has been my champion every day. 
 It makes sense, of course, we are partners in life. When we took those vows years ago. . . we promised for better or for worse, through sickness and in health. . . 
 Funny how when you are young and in love, you never really think about the worse or sickness. Maybe it's just me, but there was a certain amount of moon-eyed happily ever after when I said my vows. 
 Honestly, I'd be in worse shape without him in my life. I know this for an absolute certainty. This wasn't meant to be a "sing the hubby's praises" post, but it needs to be said. 
 For all of his help and support, he can't fix what's inside my head. OH, that I wish he could. It has been a whirlwind of tests, needles, doctors, more needles, surgery, more doctors, back to the tests, the dreaded needles, and now radiation. While I am thrilled beyond measure that I am not having to go through chemotherapy, I am trying to cope with the current radiation and oral medications. 
 Everyone around me keeps encouraging me and telling me how brave I am, how strong I am. . . not feeling it. At some point every day I feel exhaustion, fatigue, nausea, and that doesn't even begin to get into the mental battles: the continued struggle to lose weight, the dietary restrictions because of cancer, the fear that cancer will be found somewhere else, the sense of failure as I slip further behind on my goals. At times the weight of it gets the better of me. 
 I think that one is the hardest for me. I can tough it out when I don't feel great, but can still manage. I see my author friends cranking out one project after another and I get more discouraged. I know I've suffered from a lack of focus with too many projects in my queue. I've allowed criticism to derail me when I had a full head of steam working towards completion. I've allowed the poison words of certain individuals to affect my mental state to the point that I quit working on particular projects. 
 You want to know what is really sad? I have volumes of stories mostly written. For example, I was diligently working on Valkyrie's Curse. I had the first draft completed, was 78% finished with second draft revisions when I realized that the story didn't end at my ending. The overall story spans five more books which I outlined and have key scenes written for them. I was excited, I was on a roll. I can see the destination over the far horizon then the white haired witch rose up before me, hissing and flailing in wild gestations spouting words of her own self-righteousness, singing her own praises and that my methods and styles were wrong because they aren't like hers. She was right, I'm nothing like her. I don't want to be. After three rounds of being put off to review the manuscript, I got discouraged and set it aside. I will get back to it, but I have been working on getting Roxy ready for her debut. I had my manuscript for VC ready to go, had the second book first draft completed, so I needed something else to work on. In all honesty, I've had a dozen new ideas since then with a brief intro or scene written, enough to remind myself what the idea for that story is. 
 I sent my revised story of Roxy to a fabulous lady, who is an awesome author and mentor. She pointed out - very nicely I might add - plot holes and glaring errors. Hmmm, this wouldn't do. I had to make it a story that I was proud of and that readers would want to read. I rolled up my sleeves and got busy. Very little of the original story remains, but I think it's by far better. So what's the problem? 
 Finishing it. I have nearly 60K words on this story. I'm adding in some transition scenes as well as some other scenes to take it to the final destination. I was on a roll right up to April 12th, when my world came crashing down around me. It galls me to admit that I can't get it out by the deadline that I wanted. If that was the case it would have been published at the beginning of May. 
 There have been more than a few days since my surgery that I didn't even get online. I didn't crack my computer open. I didn't have the mental energy to write a few hundred words. Now I am struggling to allocate my daily limited energy to what is important. I feel like a huge weeny because I don't have the energy to be superwoman - having my house immaculate, serving healthy nutritious and tasty meals to my family - five star restaurant quality because I am the overachiever, keep up with my day job - because I have medical bills to pay, this one has to go to the top of the list, writing, blogging, exercise, mental health activities. Pick a day, any day and at least three of those things fall by the wayside. Care to venture which ones? 
 Most often the taking care of me part has been at the bottom of my priorities. Maybe it's a mom thing or a woman thing but either way, I can't do that anymore. I want to live to see my next several birthdays so I have to learn to make myself a priority. Why does this make me so emotional??? You'd think it was a good thing. I see people all of the time taking time for themselves, doing things for themselves, pampering themselves, yet I struggle to allow myself downtime to cope with cancer. 
 I will finish my books and get them published because that is a goal I have set for myself. The deadlines have been erased and pushed out even further. (I swear, if I were employing me I'd fire me to get a different content writer.) I may be in turtle mode, but by darn, I will get there. 
 So what doe this have to do with Ecclesiastes and Lamentations? In the book of Lamentations, it was basically David crying out - lamenting his sorrows. Sometimes we want to vent or get it off of our chest. Ecclesiastes was written by Solomon, astute observations and conclusions about life. Let me 
 Let me briefly summarize: Life sucks. It is like a wild rollercoaster ride that didn't pass safety inspections and no one tells you when the dangerous curves or broken tracks will appear. We make the best of it, lick our wounds, recover, get stronger, and go on. We all die eventually and when we do, what will you have to show for your legacy? What will be your lasting mark on this world you've left behind? What of value have you contributed to this world? Or have you lived a self-serving existence that didn't impact any other living soul in a positive way? 
 (This is by no means a church sanctioned summarization. For exact interpretation go read it for yourself.) 
 I know this is far from my usual uplifting encouraging post and I apologize for that. This is where I am. I have been trying to remain positive, but there are days when I fail. 
 Tomorrow is another day and here's hoping that it's a better day! 
 Write on my friends, write on!

 A Rose by Any Other Name . . . #MFRWauthor 
 Welcome to  Week 8  of the  MFRWauthors blog challenge . This week’s prompt is: How I Choose a Book Title. #MFRWauthor #amwriting #booktitles 
 
 Good Titles may roll off of the tongues of some authors, but not mine. This is often why I refer to my projects as WIP - work in progress, and tell you right up front that it is tentatively titled XXX. 
 It is strange, but when I am in my writing group, I can come up with good titles for someone else's work easier than my own. 
 
 For  Red Wine& Roses , that title came rather easily. It was the key scene that I wrote for a flash piece, then later developed into the full novel. Red wine and roses were touchpoints to Derek and Julia's dates from the beginning so it seemed like a logical title. Derek has an old fashioned view about romance that in his mind, one expression of his love for Julia is by showering her with red roses. Towards the end of the story, after the darkest moment, the reader will see the depth of his love expressed in this manner. 
 
 For my second book  Quotidiandose: 30 Days of Sass  , I had lengthy debates over whether to use that for the title or not. I thought about just going with 30 days of Sass. This book is a compilation of 30 short essays tinged with a lot of sass. A humorous view on life from the writer's desk, while offering a little motivation to the reader, this nonfiction book is straight from the heart. 
 Titles are something that typically, I ponder over and then tend to stress over. Consider the current WIP which I am targeting for completion by the end of April 2017. (Please help me stay accountable to this date!) My original story idea was titled Oral Dilemma. An erotic short where the Main character was always getting into trouble with her mouth via smart-alec quips, vocal talents behind the microphone at the bar, or oral talents in the erotic sense. It fit and I thought it was clever. However, while dusting this off from my files and giving it a thorough once over, I realized how bad my pantsing was. This was a serial that I shared on a former group blog I was managing editor for called Storytime Trysts. First of all, I cringed at rereading it, scratching my head at what I thought I was doing. Secondly, the pantsing gave me a lot of background scenes, but no real story. I really liked this character Roxanne Winters though, she had a story that needed to be told. 
 I basically have dissected this story, taken it apart and tossed out the majority. I had 57,000 words in this story. The bulk of that is gone and it currently sits at 21,354 with a revised outline, a real plot, and very real character goals. Oral Dilemma was no longer appropriate, nor did it really fit the story. I came up with the title Roxy Sings The Blues after debating several other options: The Blues Singer, Foxy Roxy, Little Girl Blue, Whiskey River (I couldn't go with that one because I decided to cut out the lengthy section of her falling into an alcoholic abyss.) and finally landed on  Roxy Sings the Blues . It fits, it's concise and there aren't twenty other titles out there with the same name. 
 Roxy Sings the Blues is another stand alone romance, but this one is romance suspense. The tentative blurb for it is: 
 _Scars tell the story of a past. Roxy 's scars aren't visible but they have carved her deeply and the pain they have caused pours out through soulful song. If facing a motherless future wasn't enough, a failed relationship from her past resurfaces to torment her. Just when she was trying to build a new life for herself, trouble making Devon Miller drags her into his chaotic life. The stakes are high as Roxy sits in the spotlight of a dangerous investigation. _ 
 Devon, a homicide detective is hot for the case and stirring embers of a forbidden fire. Will Roxy hit the right note and help her old flame solve his big case or will she be left singing the blues? 
 An author's book is like one of their children. We give them life. We watch them grow. We correct them when they go down the wrong path. We scrub them clean to be presentable to company. We hope that when they go out into the big world, they are ready. We have to cut the chord and let them stand on their own. But our readers won’t take our babies into their homes if their names aren’t catchy enough to grab attention. As a reader, I am very picky about titles. I find I do tend to pick up titles with nothing but Names especially if in a series. Especially if that name is 
 Our book babies need titles that will grab a reader's attention. This is an artform in and of itself. One that I feel that with some of my future projects - Valkyrie's Curse (NO, I haven't given up on that one.) Realm Wars (This is the series title for the books that will include Faere Warrior, Faere Guardian, Faere Mage, and two more that I haven't decided on titles for.)I am pleased with my title names. But for others - The Hamilton Project, Vamps Couture, my dragon shifter series, my nefleheim series, I'm either not happy with my working title or don't have a title yet. It is as personal as naming our biological children. But our readers won’t take our babies into their homes if their names aren’t catchy enough to grab attention. As a reader, I am very picky about titles. I find I do tend to pick up titles with nothing but Names especially if in a series. Especially if that name is 
 Funny story about that - my oldest daughter's name was selected when I was 6 months pregnant. She was going to be Rachel Lynne. Many of my shower gifts were addressed to baby Rachel. However, the moment that she made her debut into this world, I looked at her while the doctor was cleaning her up, suctioning the birth gunk, and she let out that first baby wail - she was not a Rachel. For the first twenty-four hours of her life, she was  Baby girl.  The nurses were counselling me that I could apply for her name with the state once we decided because I was to be released soon. You know how fast they kick you out after giving birth, right? 
 Well, after a gruelling delivery, I had a fever, extremely low iron, and was severely dehydrated. They kept me for another full day in which time my wonderful hubs brought the baby name books back to the hospital and we pored over them. I'm happy to say her name suits her, but it's not Rachel. But our readers won’t take our babies into their homes if their names aren’t catchy enough to grab attention. As a reader, I am very picky about titles. I find I do tend to pick up titles with nothing but Names especially if in a series. 
 That's how we want our books to be - well suited with a title. It can be a tricky thing. 
 How do I come up with a title?  Usually, it's an element of the story like the roses, or the obvious sass. Sometimes it is the character's name. I have to admit, I see the titles of other authors and wish that I were as clever. Ah well, maybe someday. 
 Let’s go take a look at how others come up with their titles!

 Maintaining My Voice 
 I'm still here guys. Let me catch you up to speed: 
 I've been working on my current WIP, Roxy Sings the Blues. Revising, editing, rewriting, . . . and I just wasn't happy with it. It wasn't flowing. It wasn't drawing me forward even and I am the author! I had to take a serious look at this and step back to evaluate what I had as opposed to where I wanted this to go. 
 I set it aside for a couple of days as I researched master plots. This was prompted when I was trying to convey my story idea to a wonderful lady who is kind of mentoring me in my writing. OK, I was a persistent nag until she took me under her wing. I'm not ashamed to admit it. 
 I was working through her class, had fully developed character worksheets, even made myself character cards to stick on my bulletin board. I spent 4 days working on shaping my plot into a reasonable timeline and developing the major nine points of my plot. I thought I had it all worked out. It seemed logical. There were twists, turns, lovable characters, one that you love to hate. . . I thought I was ready to go. 
 Of course when it was time to meet, either my computer or hers was acting glitchy and we couldn't connect for video chat. So we went to the phones. I have to be honest, the fan-girling had to be tampered down under control before I could get any semblance of intelligible speech out of my mouth. 
 She was pleasant enough about it, but basically, I needed to start over. Maybe not over, but my starting point was 13 chapters into the story. Hangs head. She was right of course, it will make the story better. Tighter. 
 I spent a day sulking and fighting the urge to pig out on pizza. I didn't have anything to make pizza, we live in a rural area where there is no pizza delivery so I avoided the pizza. I sulked some more while eating celery. Not as satisfying but I am determined to regain my curves from what has become more of a Staypuff marshmallow woman blob. 
 My wonderful friend Misty talked me down off the ledge more than a few times. She encouraged me to not give up. Even while going through an emotionally draining stressful time with a family member, she offered encouragement. This is the kind of freind everyone needs! You can't have Misty, she's mine! Go get your own. I jest, in part. 
 While sulking I snuggled up under a blanket with my kindle and a good book, and of course turned on the TV as well. Netflix, . . . that evil bottomless pit of time suck, that shiny den of temptation pops up with a movie I hadn't seen that had an actress that I like in it and I thought why the heck not. I'm already pouting about my story, and about not having pizza, why the heck not? 
 Best decision I made. Well, maybe going to the gym would have been better but I didn't choose that because I was sulking ok? Geez - small steps here. Anyway, it got my mind out of the infinite loop of what I had been thinking, because when I get something in my mind it's like it's carved into my gray matter. In the middle of an angsty part of the movie my brain says 'What if . . .' 
 I honestly couldn't tell you much about the movie as my brain kicked into high gear, working out details to fix my story. It's not quite there yet, but I'm on the right track now and out of the sulking phase. Never did get my pizza fix. 
 I'm going to focus on this for the rest of the night after dinner and tomorrow I start tackling this again. 
 That's what I've been doing, trying to maintain my voice as an author without being formulaic but also establishing a good story and writing well. 
 Write on my friends, write on!

 Phase 1 - Master Plan 
 
 Quotidiandose does not own this image. All rights reserved to the original artist. 
 Welcome to Operation Rockstar. 
 2017 is going to be my banner year. How do I know that? Because I am going to make  IT  happen! 
 If you are anything like me, you've got your goals written down. Writing down your goals is an important step towards getting them accomplished. But, how do you move them from written down to actually accomplishing them? It starts with planning. By making a plan, then working the plan, you can move items from your to-do list to checking them off and moving onto the next item. In order to do that, though, you need to take your goal, or goals and make a plan of action. 
 Let's back up a bit for a moment and take a peek at the Master List. The Master List to make 2017 the year you become the rockstar! 
 
 Be your best every day.  No matter what you do, do your very best at it. If your best for that day is to say thanks to the person caring for you, like if you have the flu and they are bringing you hot tea then be thankful. If your best is running a marathon that day, then run like your life depends on it and give it 100%. Your best fluctuates from day to day. There are days we are unstoppable. There are days when it's a trial to get from one minute to the next. Whatever your best is, do it. Know that it is your best. If you can't with a clear conscious say inside your heart that you gave your best effort then do more. If you are running the marathon and you gave 100% and didn't win then be at peace with yourself that you gave your all. If you only exerted 85% effort, then evaluate and learn from it, and know that you are capable of more so that the next time you will know that what you thought was 100% was only at 85%. Are you with me? 
 Make your goals crystalline.  For some, this means one goal. Just one. For me, it means a few. You know, an overachiever and all. I've narrowed it down to just a few. A few years back, I had 50 goals. Yeah, who was I kidding? I did manage to accomplish a few of those things but for the most part, they were on the wish list, not the master list. This is where you write them down. Post them on your fridge, on your bulletin board, wherever it is visible for you to be reminded often. 
 Become a Rockstar!  Become amazing. Become the best version of you that you can be. Become the you that you want to be. Become the you that you want to see in the mirror. How? Small steps. That is how we get from the not so hot mess to the total rockstar that everyone is going to take notice of. Look, I don't expect to be on par with Gina Carrano, or Sophia Vergara. Those women are hot! Those women are amazing but I'm not them. I am ME. You are you. That sounds like a duh moment but if you think about it, it's a profound revelation. My job is to be the best ME I can be. Your job is to be the best YOU. Each of us is a one of a kind original masterpiece. Don't be a copycat of someone else when the starring role of YOU needs to be filled! Take a few moments every day to contemplate your life, what your hopes and dreams are, who are you? 
 Get it done!  Take your master list, and break each item down into bite size steps. For instance, a top priority goal for me is to lose 50 pounds. How am I going to get there? It seems like an insurmountable task when it has been such a problem for me. How? I am going to take steps to do that. 1. I am going to follow a healthy, portion controlled, carb controlled diet plan. 2. I will increase my physical activity for improved cardiovascular and musculoskeletal health. (Say that 3 times fast!) 3. I will use daily meditations, prayer, and motivational material to improve my mental state of being because the battle is in my mind. 4. I will break it down to smaller increments of ten pounds with nonfood rewards when I reach those smaller goals. 5. Work those steps until the goal is completed. 
 Work the Plan!  You have to stick to it. It gets hard. It gets dull. It gets tedious, but don't give up. This is where a vision board might help you. I am creating myself a vision board this weekend. A vision board can be a very personal thing. It is what motivates you. The point is to make your dreams visible in order to achieve those dreams and make them your reality. If anyone is interested in me sharing the vision board, leave me a message and I will take a photo of it to share. I haven't done one in a few years, but it really did help when I did it. It also helps to have an accountability partner. Work with someone that will encourage you, that will celebrate your wins, give you the pep talk when you are in the pits, scream at you like a drill sergeant when you've been a slacker, someone who will call you on your bull! Just for the record, an accountability partner is not someone who is simply going to be your cheerleader.It's the coach making you drop and give him twenty, the drill sergeant that sends you out for a five mile run to clear your head, it's the personal trainer that pushes you to do more than you FEEL like doing because our feelings are liars. It's the person that knows when you are honestly sick and should rest for two days, then gets you back on track for 363 days to achieve your goals. 
 
 There you have the master plan. 5 easy steps to make this year a great year!

 Mile Marker Ahead 
 I must have started and stopped writing a post at least a dozen times. Based on my draft file, that number is more like fifteen. Why the false starts? 
 I have a milestone rapidly approaching - my 500th post! This isn't that post, but when I saw that little bit of information, my brain went into overdrive thinking about what can I do for a special post? What can I blog about that anyone would care to read? If I can post 500 posts, then why can't I get my crap together to finish revising my books? 
 Then I went and reviewed past posts, to see which ones were the most read. 
 Quotidiandose: 30 Days of Sass  started from my top posts, then were expanded. 
 
 This compilation is in part a celebration of that 500th post, but I wanted to do something on here, with you, my readers to celebrate. 
 Well, it's difficult to have virtual cake. It's difficult to share virtual cocktails. 
 I will still be thinking about it, but for now . . . I thought I'd take the opportunity to let everyone know of a shake up. 
 Beginning at the first of the year, my plan is to get back on track with my blogging. I know, I know, I've said that before. I stick to it for a while then when life seems to pull the rug out from under me it takes a while to regroup. 
 I'm going to go back to a format - of sorts - for my blog. My Monday mojo posts will still go up because I need a Monday pep talk and everyone seems to enjoy them. I'm undecided on the other days of the week at this point, so I'm not going to share with you the new revised schedule, because It's a very rough draft. When I get things narrowed down a bit, then I'll share. In the meantime, I can use you guys' input. What do you want to see? Which posts have you enjoyed? What do you want more of? 
 Here are a few things I've shared in the past: 
 
 recipes 
 photography ( not a professional by any means but fun) 
 bullet journal 
 writerly stuff 
 writing snippets 
 diet, exercise, fitness ( or my version of it anyway) 
 guest posts 
 guest interviews 
 fun posts 
 family 
 flash fiction 
 random madness and all that life brings with it 
 Penned Con 
 live interviews 
 
 If you like any of these in particular, please leave a comment. Want more recipes? Leave me a comment! Trust me, I have loads of recipes, between my own concoctions and the myriad of cookbooks I have, I could write a recipe every day for the next five years. But then again I'd be bored and quit so if that is something you like, I can designate a certain day of the week to share recipes, photos, and even fails. 
 I happened to think yesterday, that I haven't shared a snippet in a while. I've been so busy with doing NaNoWriMo - I won by the way with a grand total of 101,330 words in the first draft of Murder by Moonlight. 
 
 In the middle of that, I was doing revisions to Red Wine & Roses for it to be rereleased. Even though I didn't blog much, I was busy busy busy writing my little fingers away. At least my fingers got a good workout during November! 
 My writing focus is on revisions to Roxy Sings the Blues. I have my editor lined up, fielding some ideas for cover art, and fine tuning so that I can send it off to my beta readers very soon. 
 Anyone care for a snippet of that? Maybe a few teasers over the next few weeks as I move closer to the finished product? 
 My current daily todo lists are crazy busy, and if I don't write it down I forget. My bujo goes everywhere with me. It's my downloadable brain in print. I am wondering about next year's journal though, I wonder if Leuchterm makes a thicker one. Hmm, I may need to investigate. 
 Let me know what you like about the blog and let's see if I can't make next year better than ever. 
 Write on my friends, write on!

 Issues of Life 
 The past few days have been an emotional rollercoaster for me. It's times like this that I question Cassidy's sanity. I mean, who would choose this? 
 We had such a good day on Saturday, I suppose it was inevitable that the wheels should fall off on Sunday. While tackling one project, I was being pulled by someone else's project, continually asked questions until I reached a point where I had to stop what I was working on. 
 First off, this project was one that I had procrastinated on to the point that I couldn't put it off any longer. I needed to get it done. So I was already aggravated. 
 The project that my husband was asking questions about, was valid for him to ask me questions as it was pertaining to our finances. Then everything degenerated down from there.  hangs head 
 How many of us know, I mean really know that you can't compartment your life like a waffle into little squares? If you can manage that then message me and share how you do it. 
 In my world, things are all interconnected like a woven cloth. The white strand touches twenty others. Or you can look at it like the plate of spaghetti. Well, I got my spaghetti all over his waffles. 
 If we are being honest, it's more like spaghetti. How we view our finances are affected by a) our upbringing, b) past problems c) expectations d) fears e)our relationship with the financial partner. All of those factors come into play at some point and are often expressed through what we communicate. 
 I'm not going to tell you all about our finances, that's not what this is about. We have some differences between us about them that we will work out. My problem is the underlying problems that come out in moments like this. 
 I have been so guilty of this in the past, that I am acutely aware of carefully choosing my words and not blasting my first thoughts without a filter. The filter needs to be applied to similar problems in the past, past words that were spoken, past situations that you've been through, past fights over the subject. . . it all plays a part to the emotions that come up with the current topic. 
 In a microsecond, our brain goes to our retrieval file and pulls up the entire folder on how we feel about finance anything. Last time we got into a fight - shields up. We've been married for a few years, there has been more than one fight over finances. In most marriages, there is one that spends and one that saves. I'm the spender and I know you aren't surprised. 
 My issue with this whole thing is not the finances. It's not about how much I spent because I know that I spent too much. It's the comments that cut me to the core that are outside of the topic that are affecting the statements made. 
 The current plan isn't working, so I need to rethink, reevaluate, and make a new plan. How ironic that I got a notification this morning that two readers liked my post,  Unceasing . Wow, thank you for that reminder. I needed to hear that. I needed to be reminded that it's not the negative words of someone else. It's not getting validation from anyone else. The reason I write, and that I will  NOT  stop pursuing my dream even if it is at a snail's pace, is because it is part of who I am. 
 I had some amazing friends encourage me in this matter, some were kind loving words, others were straight and to the point, and yet others were tactlessly pointed out, but valid all the same. 
 On one hand, it is devastating to hear that a loved one doesn't believe in your vision. That's ok. It's not his vision after all but mine. It's not his place to validate me or give me approval. I need to do this for myself. On the other hand, it's good to know where they stand so that I can adjust my course, my expectations accordingly. 
 Giving up on my dream isn't going to make him think any differently but it will certainly make me think differently. It would be quitting on myself and I can't do that. 
 I'm not angry anymore. I'm not hurt either. I know that I am taking the road less traveled. This is my path and it needs to coincide with our path as much as his career path does also. Neither of us is wrong, just different. 
 Sometimes we embrace the differences, other times we accept them. 
 Soon I will have important news to share and to think, I almost quit just before the finish line - tsk tsk. 
 It's all good! Write on my friends, write on! 
 Ellie
