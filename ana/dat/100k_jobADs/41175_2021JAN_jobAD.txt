 Developer needed to create and manage a new platform for a new live music and members venue 
 Role overview 
 We are looking for an ambitious developer to help us launch a platform never before seen across a live music events venue. Our members system will look to be the first to utilise Blockchain and run our own crypto currency and offer members benefits along the way. 
 This will form a key part of a new venue opening in 2021 and be the first of many, on what is a long term international project. 
 If this sounds exciting and you are looking for a challenging next step please get in touch to chat more.
