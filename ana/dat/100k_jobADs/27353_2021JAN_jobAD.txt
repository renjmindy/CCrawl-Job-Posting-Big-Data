  Correcting 3 Commonly Heard Job Search 'Truths'  
 Virginia Franco 
 November 09, 2016 
 Job search misconceptions are more common than one might think amongst even the most successful professionals. Particularly if it has been awhile since they've had to job hunt.  Related: Job Boards: Job Search Do Or Don't?  While some common job search truths from past decades still hold water, others don't. Below are three common job search 'truths' debunked: 
 
 1. I Must Apply Online To Get A Job 
 Definitely false.  A strategy of applying online is not likely to get you very far – no matter how well suited you think you are. Why? It's hard to guess what is going on behind the scenes at a company. A manager may have someone in line for the role – but is having them go through the process to ensure compliance with HR regulations. Or the role gets posted just in time for a senior manager to announce a corporate restructure. Regardless of why, there are countless reasons why you should review postings, but not hang your hat on them. 
 
 Respond within 72 hours of a job appearing to have your best shot, and continue to peruse job boards to get a sense of which companies are hiring. 
 
 2. My Resume Must Get Past Applicant Tracking Software (ATS) Systems To Get A Call 
 Somewhat true, and a little false.  While it's true that at some point, your resume may be subjected to ATS or software screening, your best bet is to network effectively to ensure your resume is seen by a human prior to being read by a machine. 
 
 This is your resume's best shot at getting grabbed and redistributed once the screening requirement is complete. 
 
 3. If My LinkedIn Rocks, Recruiters Will Come To Me **** 
 True - sometimes.  A great profile is sometimes, but not always, a silver bullet leading to recruiter outreach. The best strategy to get as much traffic as possible to your LinkedIn profile is to remain active – through outreach, content sharing and group participation. 
 
 The greater the LinkedIn activity, the higher you will rank within the feeds of your connections. Perhaps just as important, recruiters tend to reach out to actively engaged users than those with a stagnant profile.
