 Description 
 The Interviewing Gets The Job Workbook  comes in handy when one is interviewing for a job which can often be a scary prospect. So much is riding on the outcome and yet individuals receive so little training on how to interview effectively. This Interviewing Workbook effectively prepares readers on how to present themselves in a confident, relaxed manner. This workbook is excellent in preparing people for all kinds of job interviews. 
 The Interviewing Workbook offers insights into what employers want in an employee, tips for overcoming nervousness, and specific help in answering tough questions. More than just information, readers have the opportunity to practice their own questions to ask employers, what is allowed and what is not. Also included in this workbook is a section on how to dress and rules for framing better questions.
