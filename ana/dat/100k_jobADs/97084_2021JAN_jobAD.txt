 7 Sad reasons why people give up on their dreams 
 Our childhood memories often involve the dreams we wanted to pursue as adults. In your youth the dream seemed achievable and within reach, and it probably is, but with age and life experiences comes a dwindling sense of hope and wonder. Fast forward to years later, you have most likely put that dream behind you and have opted for practicality and security over passion and purpose. While you have an undying desire to go after your dreams, there is always internal and external voices that leave you hesitant to follow through. 
 Below are seven reasons why people tend to give up on their dreams. 
 
 
 They fear being judged by those they care about 
 
 
 Following your passion later on in life is sure to raise a lot of eyebrows from the people around you. They might find it irrational and even irresponsible to leave your stable job to pursue a lifelong dream. Sensing judgment and pushback from your loved ones for entering a new chapter in your life is sure to leave anyone feeling discouraged. 
 
 
 They give others the power to influence their decisions 
 
 
 Most of our decisions are easily influenced by the people with whom we surround ourselves. Due to the fear of what people might say or think of you, we often make decisions that’ll make our loved ones more accepting and comfortable instead of making decisions that will make us truly happy. 
 
 
 They fail once – and never try again 
 
 
 Failure is an inevitable part of life. As much as we try to avoid it, it still manages to pop up every once in a while, to make us better than before. Many people are left so discouraged, demotivated and even embarrassed by their failures that they choose to let the dream go all together. 
 
 
 They don’t learn how to discipline themselves 
 
 
 Achieving your goals takes a lot of discipline and focus. If you aren’t disciplined throughout your journey of pursuing your dreams, you will easily get side-tracked, making you lose focus of what’s important. 
 
 
 They would rather settle for short-term rewards 
 
 
 The journey to achieving your dreams is sometimes long and tiresome but a combination of consistent work and effort will yield mega results in the future. People are often looking for a quick buck and don’t have the patience to see the seeds of their hard work come to fruition. This leaves them frustrated and demotivated if they don’t see significant results within a short-term period leading them to give up. 
 
 
 They refuse to be flexible and adjust 
 
 
 The journey to your dreams is a winding road full of sharp turns and obstacles. If you want to succeed, then you need to be able to adjust and be flexible to successfully navigate your way around challenges. People who aren’t willing to adopt this approach are less likely to succeed and more likely to give up. 
 
 
 They fear going it alone and having no support 
 
 
 The possibility of not having your loved ones fully support you on your journey is sad and frightening. The pain of feeling alone and not knowing if you are on the right path is enough to push any one into giving up on their dreams.
