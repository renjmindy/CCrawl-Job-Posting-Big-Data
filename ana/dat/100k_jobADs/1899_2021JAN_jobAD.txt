 HOW PARTNERSHIPS LEAD TO MULTIPLE CAREER OPPORTUNITIES FOR JOB SEEKERS 
 The drastic business growth in Saline County in Arkansas has allowed the Central Arkansas Workforce Development Area (CAWDA) to provide services to employers and has assisted individuals with obtaining employment. In particular, the CAWDA hosted a hiring event for the new Hobby Lobby location in Benton during the early part of July 2017. 
 Hobby Lobby contacted the Arkansas Workforce Center in Benton to assist with the recruitment efforts to fill all positions at the new location. Immediately, CAWDA’s Business Service Team and partners constructed, organized, and communicated a plan to assure that the employment needs of Hobby Lobby were fulfilled. 
 The CAWDA, the Department of Workforce Services, and Goodwill assisted with the coordination of the event and hiring process. Recruiting efforts included a mass distribution of the event across multiple online platforms, including social media. This event reached over 13,000 individuals. 
 As a result, over 640 job seekers attended the event and Hobby Lobby hired over 70 individuals. This event led numerous job seekers to new career opportunities and created an applicant pool for other job opportunities that are available in the Saline County area.
