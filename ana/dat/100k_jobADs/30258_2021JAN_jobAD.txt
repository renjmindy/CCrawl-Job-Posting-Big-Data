 Fashion e-commerce business. My business is a fashion style house, which collects customer style preferences using a quiz in the website and then fulfills their style requests by sending them stylist picked clothes to their home, allowing them to try and keep/return as per their wish. The clothes can be for a particular occassion or for everyday work outfits or for casual everyday wear too. 
Depends on the customer's choice and style preferences. 
Main tasks/goal: Content creation + Management of social media sites to increase fan base and leading them to website for lead generation is the goal. 
Need 1 to 2 months commitment from the content creator to work on this on-going project to help an organic growth of followers and increase brand awareness. If i am happy with the results, i can continue with the same content creator for additional months.
