 Research and fieldwork 
 Sunbird Foraging Behaviour 
 Animals often have access to a wide range of information they could use to inform and refine their decisions. They do not however always use it. I am collaborating with Professor  Sue Nicolson  and masterâ€™s degree student  Celiwe Ngcamphalala  at the University of Pretoria to better understand how and when sunbirds will use taste to inform their foraging decisions and what influences how they choose among differently shaped flowers.

 The Role of Cognition in Nest Building 
 With many similarities to tool use, nest construction is a useful behaviour to study when trying to understand the evolution and nature of physical cognition. I am interested in the role of learning in birds nest building behaviour and what criteria the birds attend to when constructing their nests e.g. the colour and structure of nest material.

 Cooperative Hunting and Group Decision Making 
 Interested in the factors influencing group movements particularly cooperative hunting, I worked with Professor  Alan Wilson  and colleges on the  CARDyAL project , writing an extensive review on the factors influencing group hunting behaviour and studying the factors influencing movement coordination in flocks of sheep.

 Hummingbird Foraging Behaviour 
 Interested in the economics and ecology of animals' foraging decisions, I use artificial flowers to investigate the foraging behaviour of Rufous hummingbirds including: their use of taste to decide what to drink and their responses to variation in reward quality (risk-sensitivite choice) and competition from other hummingbirds.

 To gain more insight into hummingbirds' foraging ecology I used pollen samples and sightings to identify which wild flowers they visited. 
 
 I also used microsatellite DNA to identify genetic differences among populations breeding either side of the Rocky Mountains.

 In The Field 
 Over the last 20+ years I have amassed a wealth of field experience, working in a variety habitats surveying for and researching a wider range of different species including: North American raptors, burrowing owls, flowers and habitats, sunbirds, weaverbirds, otters, water voles, badgers, salmon, blanding's turtle, dragonflies, butterflies and moths.
