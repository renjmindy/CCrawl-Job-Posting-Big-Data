 Veteran Job Preference 
 Jobs Available Now 
 I recently posted two articles on the Labor Department featuring information on  Job Discrimination/Preference  issues and on Job opportunities through "   Hire Vets First ". In the continuing interest in helping our veteran heroes who may be out of a job or thinking of finding a better one, or relocating, I'm extending the series on Jobs by featuring a few more sites dedicated to assisting our veterans, including homeless veterans, in finding jobs. 
 One is VetJobs.com  which supplies  employment assistance   and a  job search   facility. I highly recommend that you do the work of reviewing and using the employment assistance page before you jump into doing the job search (it is ok to peek at the job search, but if you don't do the preparation, you have vastly reduced chances). 
 When you reach the job search portion notice that there is an "Age of Jobs" window. If you don't select the age of jobs (say posted in last 7 days) then you may get some pretty stale ones. You can do a keyword search or by type of job (or all) and select the state (or all). If it comes up blank, expand to earlier dates, nearby states, or all jobs. 
 Another is USAJobS which has a **** **Veterans ' Employment Resource Center ** . Once again, I recommend you start here. Do the 2 step process, and also look at the "additional veterans' resources" on the same page before you go to the  job search   .  These are all government jobs. 
 When you reach the job search portion, notice the keywords portion which you can leave blank for all jobs or put in words like "management" to get all management jobs. Again, you can select the age of the posting from 24 hours, 3 days etc. There is another useful window where you can select a zip code that you are interested in and also select how many miles you are willing to travel. You can get back to the resource center mentioned above by clicking on the veteran's tab. 
 Homeland securtiy needs help, so try their USAJOBS  Homeland Security   page. 
 Active Duty family Members looking for a job ? Try DoD's  Military Assistance Program  **** designed for spouses and other members of active duty military. It seems this site has quite a few active duty readers, so I've found this for them. 
 Be sure to run your cursor over the block labeled "Center Programs Menu" on this page for a set of links to various features of MAP. 
 Here is another useful link  Career One St op   
 This link takes you a map where you can click on a state and be directed to that state's Labor Department or Job Locator. The site, called America's Job Bank is no longer in operation, but the map is still there and the Labor Department or other link that it takes you to is current and operational. Notice before you make a map selection there are links at the bottom right for veterans in case you wish to stay with that route. 
 Finally (for today's post) try  Corporate Gray 
 This site does require you to register. I don't know the consequences to that. You can register on most of the other sites as an option (recommeded), but this one requires registration to participate in the job search. 
 
 We link employers with transitioning and former military personnel through our Corporate Gray Series of military-to-civilian career transition books, Corporate Gray Job Fairs, and Corporate Gray Online . 
 
 They list a number of job fairs on the front page. 
 Happy Thanksgiving. I hope you and yours are having (or had) a great Thanksgiving feast and really have a  lot  to be thankful for. 
 Anyone that has links to other useful sites are welcome to include them in the comment section and I'll check them out. I'm not above editing to add or remove links in this post. I'm not interested in posting single job opportunities though (not enough room) , so please limit your links to those with state or national searches that remain current. 
 Oldtimer.

 Hire Vets First

 Hire Vets First - VETS 
 I hope that all veterans that need jobs or considering changing jobs know about this site on your nearby internet:  Veterans' Employment & Training Service (VETS). 
 It is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor. "Veterans Succeeding in the 21st Century Workforce". 
 The mission statement for VETS is to provide veterans and transitioning service members with the resources and services to succeed in the 21st century workforce by maximizing their employment opportunities, protecting their employment rights and meeting labor-market demands with qualified veterans today. 
 Down the left side of the page are boxes of clickable information for 
 
 Service providers 
 
 What grants are available? 
2007 HVRP Urban and Non-Urban SGA 
What are the requirements for priority of service? 
 
 
 
 Veterans, Service Members and Families 
 
 What is Veterans Preference? 
USERRA Questions? 
 Where can I find help with employment? 
What should I know about licensing and certification? **** 
 
 Employers 
 
 
 
 How do I find qualified veterans? 
What does USERRA require? 
What is required of Federal contractors? 
 
 
 Down the right side of the page are clickable links to Transition Assistance Program (TAP) Information and other valuable resources. If I were a veteran looking for help in preparing for a job, I would start down the right hand column and click every line and at least scan what they have to offer, then sign up. Everything from how to get your documents, how to prepare a resume, how to convert your military experience into civilian readable lingo, how to convert your rank into comparable rank in a civilian organization, how to determine what jobs you may be qualified for, how to schedule interviews, what to wear, what to bring, what to say, how to conduct yourself, and where to find listings for both federal and civilian jobs that give veterans preference. 
 Here is what Department of Labor says about the TAP program: 
 
 The Transition Assistance Program (TAP) workshops have provided job-search assistance to well over one million separating and retiring military members and their spouses since 1990. Studies have indicated those who attend TAP workshops find employment sooner than those not participating. 
 
 
 The Departments of Defense, Labor, Veteran Affairs and Transportation are dedicated to providing you with these important workshops for years to come. TAP workshops are conducted by professionally trained facilitators. Participants will learn how to write effective resumes and cover letters, proper interviewing techniques, and the most current methods for successful job searches. The workshops further provide labor market conditions, assessing your individual skills and competencies, information regarding licensing and certification requirements for certain career fields and up-to-date information regarding your veteran benefits. Information addressing the special needs of disabled veterans is also available 
 
 If you are out of a job with time on your hands, what do you have to lose? There is enormous resource information here. The manual  can be downloaded and viewed on line - all 184 pages of it. Check it out! 
 Use the site above to decide what documents you need to get for your portfoleo and begin building a resume now. Enroll in the TAP program through VETS. Keep looking for a job with whatever you have, but if you want top dollar and want the very best chance of beating the other guy out, plan out a strategy and build a resume as a special project. It will make a difference, but don't stop looking/trying just because you have not completed this program. Look for a job, work on the program, and if you have not been placed yet or are not satisfied with what you took, finish the program and apply again. You will be better prepared and better accepted. 
 There are some Special Programs you could be interested in - look at the very bottom of the right hand column and find 
 
 Helments to Hardhats 
 Troops 2 Truckers 
 Troops to Teachers  
 
 (These links here are shortcuts to the programs, the logos were added from the sites by me) 
 Next: Job listing site for current employment opportunities for veterans .
