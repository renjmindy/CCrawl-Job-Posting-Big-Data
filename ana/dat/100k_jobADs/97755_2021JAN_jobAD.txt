 Apply the latest zero-knowledge cryptographic protocols to concrete problems in the blockchain space. 
 Role overview 
 Role overview 
 Metastate is looking for a cryptographer & researcher interested in zero-knowledge cryptographic protocols and their application to distributed ledger technology to work with us to design, evaluate, and implement zero-knowledge proof constructions such as zkSNARKs and zkSTARKs, distributed cryptographic protocols such as threshold encryption and distributed key generation, and cryptographic primitives such as elliptic curves and hash functions, then put this cryptography into practice in order to realise privacy and scalability capabilities required by the next generation of blockchain networks. 
 This role offers the chance to work closely with a small team on compelling cross-disciplinary problems in theoretical computer science, cryptography, game theory, economics, and systems design, and enjoy a high degree of independence in working conditions and task prioritization. 
 Responsibilities 
 
 Evaluate and analyze existing zkSNARK and zkSTARK proof systems such as Groth '16, Ben-Sasson '18, and PLONK for security, expressivity, and performance; monitor the state of the research field for compelling new theoretical advances 
 Update & alter existing cryptographic protocols, customize them for specific proof-of-concept and production use-cases 
 Produce technical specifications for designs & instantiations of cryptographic protocols and assist with implementation in coordination with team members 
 Implement, review, and test cryptographic operations & protocols, primarily in Rust, evaluate existing implementations 
 
 Example projects & publications 
 
 The Multi-Asset Shielded Pool  (to be published soon) 
 PLONK & plookup  (in progress) 
 The PLONK by hand series 
 The Demystification series  (Supersonic, Fractal) 
 
 Qualifications 
 
 Prior experience with cryptographic protocols, especially zkSNARKS or zkSTARKs (though not specifically required) 
 Prior experience in low-level systems programming, ideally in Rust 
 Self-motivated & self-organized 
 
 Bonus Qualifications 
 
 Academic research background in mathematics, computer science, economics, and/or game theory 
 Prior experience with distributed ledger (blockchain) technology 
 Experience in a functional programming language such as Haskell or Ocaml 
 Experience with a proof assistance such as Idris, Coq, or Agda 
 
 Misc. 
 Remote or local (ZÃ¼rich/Zug, Berlin). When remote, preferred if mostly located within (+/- 7 hours) Central European time zones. North America is fine. 
 Ideally someone who enjoys travel, nature and hiking. Often we find that protocols are best designed not in a meeting room but rather on a trail.

 Metastate is a research and engineering team focused on implementing cutting-edge research from numerous disciplines (distributed systems, PLT, zero-knowledge cryptography) and deploying them to solve hard problems in the blockchain space, such as scalability, secure smart contract languages, secure randomness or privacy. Metastate is a remote-first team, currently composed of 15 cross-disciplinary researchers and engineers located around the world. Our work culture is characterized by open-allocation, where team members have a high degree of freedom and autonomy in choosing when to work, what to work on, and whom to work with. Metastate was founded in early 2019 by @adrian_brink, @awasunyin and @cwgoes, with extensive experience in the blockchain space and who previously co-founded Cryptium Labs, a security-oriented proof-of-stake validator from the Swiss Alps.
