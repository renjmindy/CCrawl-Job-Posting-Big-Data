The Moth's Return 
 [Poetry and Prose by James Linde] 
 October 20, 2016  by   jemzlinde 
 Fall on the Job 
 It's the season. 
Twenty feet up on a cold wet ladder, twisting and cursing 
the air-hose wrapped around his leg, the warped plywood 
wobbling in one hand, and the nail-gun in the other, 
a framer meets a weaver. 
 A. diadematus  , ubiquitous spider this time of year, 
marked like some medieval illumination - 
the kind done in brown ink on parchment, 
with stiff figures in the borders, white hands, white faces, 
fall's  mappa mundi  in miniature - suspended between the studs 
no longer, masterpiece in shreds, rappelling in reverse 
back up the safety line like it's all in a day's work, 
just take a deep breath, 
people fall off the roof all the time.
