 Top Facebook Executive Forced Out Of Job For Being Trump Supporter: Our Polarized Nation

 Executives from Facebook, Twitter Inc. and Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., have had to answer questions from lawmakers about potential bias in their treatment of conservative viewpoints. Tech executives concede that Silicon Valley is predominantly liberal—Mr. Zuckerberg said in Senate testimony that it is “an extremely left-leaning place”—yet they have steadfastly maintained that politics doesn't play a role in how they police content on their sites. 
 Facebook Inc. executive and virtual-reality wunderkind Palmer Luckey was a rising star of Silicon Valley when, at the height of the 2016 presidential contest, he donated $10,000 to an anti-Hillary Clinton group. 
 I have had a Twitter account  since early 2012, and from then until now have posted  roughly 11K+ tweets with 13K+ followers . Up until the Midterm elections I had never had a block placed on my account and had never been suspended. That all changed on the night of November 6, 2018, when Twitter closed my account because they said I had been ‘sending spam’. The ‘spam’ I am accused of sending was replies to mainstream news tweets, where I supported Republican candidates. Twitter did not like that because it potentially hurt their candidates. 
 The irony of having a country  that exercises its right to free speech over social media when the Liberals who own social media are vehemently against free speech is overwhelming. I have to maintain two Facebook accounts as one of them is always suspended because I post articles that are pro-Christian, pro-Conservative and anti-Liberal. The people who own Twitter,  Facebook  and the others are rabid Liberals who seek to silence any and all opposition. 
 Why Did Facebook Fire a Top Executive? Hint: It Had Something to Do With Trump 
 FROM THE WSJ:  His donation sparked a backlash from his colleagues. Six months later, he was out. Neither Facebook nor Mr. Luckey has ever said why he left the social-media giant. When testifying before Congress about data privacy earlier this year, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg denied the departure had anything to do with politics. 
 Mr. Luckey, it turns out, was put on leave, then fired, according to people familiar with the matter. More recently, he has told people the reason was his support for Donald Trump and the furor that his political beliefs sparked within Facebook and Silicon Valley, some of those people say. 
 Internal Facebook emails suggest  the matter was discussed at the highest levels of the company. In the fall of 2016, as unhappiness over the donation simmered, Facebook executives including Mr. Zuckerberg pressured Mr. Luckey to publicly voice support for libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, despite Mr. Luckey’s yearslong support of Mr. Trump, according to people familiar with the conversations and internal emails viewed by The Wall Street Journal. 
 
 Mr. Luckey’s ouster from Facebook was a harbinger of battles that have broken out over the past year over the overwhelmingly liberal culture of Silicon Valley, which has given the tech industry public-relations headaches and brought unwanted attention from Washington.
