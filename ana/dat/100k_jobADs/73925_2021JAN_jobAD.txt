 Throwback Thursday: Old lady poetry -> 
 My dream job would be product development in the Reese's Peanut Butter department

 Did! You!  See  this?! 
 The Hershey Company, as it is known formally, has come out with Reese's Peanut Butter Cups for Peanut Butter LOVERS. All caps! "Extra layer of smoother, sweet peanut butter creme." 
 OMG. 
 I paid a springtime-inspired visit to the nearby ice cream store yesterday, salivating for a Zanzibar chocolate ice cream sundae smothered in peanut butter sauce. Zanzibar chocolate, for the uninitiated is made by Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream with three, count 'em, three kinds of cocoa "for a rich, fudge brownie taste." See what I was craving there? A Reese's Peanut Butter-inspired ice cream sundae. 
 "Oh, I'm sorry," the ice cream scooper apologized, "we don't carry peanut butter sauce anymore." 
 My ears could not believe their eyes. My eyes fell out of my head. My chin dropped to my chest. My chest began heaving in deep shuddering sobs. 
 Oh, it wasn't  that  bad. 
 But I was a little disappointed. 
 A lot disappointed. 
 The scooper kid offered me extra whipped cream and a cherry. 
 I accepted. 
 I love peanut butter. Deeply adore peanut butter. Currently own three kinds of nut butters and have been known to eat creamy Jif a quarter cup at a time. 
 Don't judge. 
 When the dessert cart comes around at the end of a decadent dinner and the waiter describes the house-made carrot cake with cream cheese frosting, I'm like "meh." Warm and oozy molten chocolate cake? You have my attention, but … . Peanut butter pie topped with peanut butter whip? Sold! 
 So when Hershey's announces Reese's Peanut Butter Cups for Peanut Butter LOVERS, I'm trying to figure out how to be the first in line. 
 Online I scrolled through 85 different kinds of chocolate and peanut butter combinations-milk chocolate, white chocolate, dark chocolate, miniature cups, snack size cups, regular cups, big cups, king-sized cups, chips, pieces, crunchers, crunchy cookies, sticks and in this pastel time of year, eggs in every size until I finally come to Reese's Peanut Butter Cups for Peanut Butter LOVERS. 
 There's no "Buy Now" button. 
 Where can I get my hands on those things?
