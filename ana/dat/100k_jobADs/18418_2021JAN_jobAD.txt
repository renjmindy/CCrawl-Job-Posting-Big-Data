 When People Say Good Luck 
 Posted on  January 10, 2019  by  Luigi Cappel 
 I was in the shower this morning listening to Episode 55 of  The Poker Mindset podcast . 
 One of the topics they discussed was wishing people good luck. Like saying "good luck on the table tonight".  Gareth  made a great comment along the lines of (paraphrasing) so the 3,000 hours of playing on the tables and 500 hours of study, come down to good luck? I hope not. 
 It's been a while since I consciously thought about this, but I rarely wish people good luck unless it is with their Lotto ticket or something that truly requires luck. There is no skill in parting with cash for a raffle. Otherwise I do feel that wishing someone luck, is almost a sign of disrespect. You know, like a sarcastic "Good luck with that!" 
 I'm waiting for approval from ACC for back surgery and when it finally comes, I don't want people saying good luck. I'm relying on the surgeon having completed years of diligent study, of his attention to detail, a great team alongside him, all with many years of experience and the fact that he has performed the particular fusion operation, which is fairly new, over a hundred times with only one surgery that had complications which I believe were unrelated. 
 I met a cop recently (I only mention his occupation because fitness is a crucial part of his daily work) who had the same surgery from the same specialist, and he was back on the job after 6 weeks of recovery. That's what I want. 
 I was going to write a spiel about some of my many past career successes, but it started looking like a memoire when I still have a good chunk of my career ahead of me. The crux of it was a saying I really like and that is probably all I really needed to say. 
 The harder and smarter I work, the luckier I get.
