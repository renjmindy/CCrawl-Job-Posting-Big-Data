 Creating a culture of learning and development 
 
 Creating a culture of learning and development 
 Published on: February 27, 2020 
 At WorkSafeBC, ongoing training and development is key to the success of individuals, teams, and ultimately to serving the workers and employers of B.C. By offering continuous learning and career development opportunities, we are committed to fostering an environment that both challenges and motivates our team members to grow within their careers. 
 Meet Ognjen Dukic, recovery and return-to-work specialist 
 We’re committed to the health and safety of workers and employers across B.C. And when a person is injured at work, part of their recovery process might be to work with a recovery and return-to-work specialist like Ognjen Dukic. 
 Ognjen completed his bachelor’s degree in human kinetics at UBC in 2010. Upon graduating, he joined our Occupational Rehabilitation and Return-to-Work Program supporting injured workers. 
 What has been your career experience with WorkSafeBC? 
 WorkSafeBC encourages personal and professional development for all staff — helping us to stay ahead of industry practices. To put this into perspective, when I began my career with WorkSafeBC, I completed 12 weeks of training. I was impressed by the relevant content, delivery, and in-depth training methods, including the numerous hands-on activities and exercises to help me understand how the work we do helps injured workers. 
 In addition to the preliminary training we receive, we also have access to many professional development courses available via classroom or online eLearning. This ongoing training is extremely valuable and helps me enhance my skills and continue to learn and grow. 
 What aspect of your career at WorkSafeBC do you value most? 
 I value the collaborative nature of our work environment. My team has about 15 to 20 people and we always make the time to engage with each other by sharing insights and advice, or working together to discuss solutions. It’s been really great being a part of this organization, there is so much support by my team and management — you’re never on your own. If you require assistance, it’s there for you. This collaboration is how we grow together and learn more as a result. 
 People here are extremely supportive of one another — regardless of what department you work for. We are all working together toward a common goal, and every department utilizes its specialities and expertise to help others. 
 Within Claims, how do you see the impact you make to support WorkSafeBC’s goals? What impact does that have on you? 
 Our goals include helping to rehabilitate injured workers, and to increase employers’ knowledge of workplace health and safety. But we also connect our work to shared values of service and accountability and how we are making a difference. This meaningful work is where I make a positive impact and it helps motivate me to continue to learn and develop my skill set to be my very best. That’s why I love working here.
