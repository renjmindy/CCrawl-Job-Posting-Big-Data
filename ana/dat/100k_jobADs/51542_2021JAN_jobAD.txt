 Career 
progression. 
 At Headford we have a well-structured progression scheme which works well for most people and allows a competent consultant to rise quickly to a position of expertise and influence within the company. 
 However, everybody has their own natural pace and we will neither hold you back nor push you before you're ready. It will soon become clear where you belong and where you want to be. Square peg, square hole.
