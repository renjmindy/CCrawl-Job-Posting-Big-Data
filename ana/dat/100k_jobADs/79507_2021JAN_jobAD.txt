 Environment Concept Artist

 Playmake is hiring a contract Environment Concept Artist! 
 Hi there! I‚Äôm Andrew, CEO of Playmake. **** 
 Are you our next Environment Concept Artist? Here‚Äôs why you should be! 
 ‚Äç 
 Think multiplayer, theme-park-like spaces  ‚Äç 
 This role is about designing spaces for groups of people to move through, as well as about setting mood through form and color. If your sole environment-design experience is in drawing landscapes or individual structures, this may not be the role for you. 
 However, if you have experience sketching an entire traversable space at once, using tools of the craft like axonometry, traffic-flow callouts, and detail zoom-ins, we‚Äôd like to talk to you. 
 ‚Äç 
 We‚Äôre well aware that pictorial maps exist, as a genre, independently of Disney parks. But did you really think we‚Äôd show anything else as an example?  üòâ 
 ‚Äç 
 ‚Äç  You‚Äôll work closely with a small, highly-skilled team. 
 Our team has experience creating fun for millions of players at companies like Unity, Apple, NetherRealm Studios, and Hasbro. 
 While concepting, you‚Äôll collaborate in fast cycles with game-makers who are extremely dedicated to what they do.  Take a look at the project spec we put together for reworking our lobby ; we work by defining what we need to accomplish for the player, and then we iterate until we nail it.

 _Our 3D artists just need your concept sketches to fire their imagination!

 ‚Äç 
 You‚Äôll be creating player experience on top of already-strong core gameplay . 
 That‚Äôs not just my squishy opinion. Our first game,  Murder Party  , is currently live with scratch art, and we already have player retention as strong as the top 10 games on Roblox. 
 Players love the game, and we need someone (you??) to pull together the game systems we‚Äôve built into a believable, inhabitable world. 
 This is what players are saying about our game. 
‚Äç 
 Now think about how you‚Äôre going to blow their minds 
even more with fully-realized environments. 
 ‚Äç 
 You‚Äôll reach 10s of millions of players  ‚Äç 
 If you‚Äôve been living under a rock (I mean, more than we‚Äôve all been living under a rock in 2020), Roblox is now played by 75% of 7-to-12-year olds in the U.S. each month, and is growing globally. That‚Äôs 170 million players a month across the whole platform; your work can reach an audience bigger than Steam‚Äôs. 
 ‚Äç 
 Details of the position 
 This is a contract role. 
 We were fully-remote before 2020, and we remain fully-remote. You can work from anywhere that has a good Internet connection. 
 ‚Äç 
 How to apply  ‚Äç 
 Start by  playing our first game . Then, take a look at  the spec for this project . 
 If this is the right role for you, you‚Äôll know. You‚Äôll already be thinking ‚ÄúAha! We can‚Äôt make the environment look like a ‚Äòkids‚Äô game‚Äô from 10 years ago, because Roblox players today have already seen every top AAA game on Youtube and they refuse to be pandered to...and we have to show them a fictional setting that references the infinite amounts of shonen anime/streamer videos they‚Äôre watching every day...‚Äù 
 If that‚Äôs you, then contact me,  andrew@playmake.games , with a link to your portfolio and we‚Äôll go from there!
