 Jobs At Google Infographic 
 __ Oct 13 Aug 31  __ Omri Shabath 
 According to many surveys, polls and reports, one of the best places to work is at Google. I have found a great infographic from JobVine (South African Job Portal) that describes the process of getting a job at Google and provides interesting facts and stats about Google’s employment. 
 Here’s a key points transcription of it (You can find the infographic with full details at the bottom): 
 Google receives over a million resumes every year. Each and every one is being reviewed and only 4,000-6,000 employees are eventually hired (about 0.4%). 
 The hiring process in Google: 
 1. A recruiter screens for the basic technical, education and experience requirements. 
2. The recruiter is contacting the first stage survivors and explains them the process and what they should be expecting. 
3. First interviews with 4-5 people for 45 minutes with each one. 
4. The interviewers submit a feedback in a standard format with numerical ranking about the candidates. The matching Google employers are asked for their opinion. 
5. A hiring committee, which consists senior managers, directors and experienced employees, discussed the candidates. 
6. Senior level management executive reviews the committee’s offer. 
7. A compensation committee discussing the candidates compensation. 
8. Top executive reviews all the offers. 
9. The candidates receives their offers. 
 The total number of interviews have been reduced to 4-9 instead of 29 in the past. 
 Crazy Interview Questions Examples: 
 – How many golf balls can fit in a school bus? 
– How many piano tuners are there in the entire world 
– A man pushed his car to a hotel and lost his fortune. What happened? 
 In 2011, Google plans to hire more than 6,200 new workers which represent 25% workforce increase. In the last 10 years, Google’s workforce has grown from 2.3K to 28.8K (more than 1250% growth). It still just 35% of Microsoft’s workforce size. 
 The yearly salaries at Google range from $143,000 to $241,000.
