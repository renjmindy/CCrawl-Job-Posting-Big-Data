 Tag: dream job 
 86: 'Don't Let Me Get Me' by P!nk 
 Fergie    enjoyed going to bars  way before  Will seduced her into his way of partying  because it was a break from her mess of a life. Never the best at anything, a teacher's pet only in the way that she dated them, and her parents wasted no time telling her how she was wasting hers by doing everything wrong. 
 She let it get to her. She couldn't stand herself and wasted even more time insulting herself in the mirror. 
 She did enjoy singing, so she decided to find happiness in that. But She was soon told to change everything about herself to become a pop star. So she did, but it wasn't enough. She was just compared to other, better pop stars - and that based on being all pretty, which she didn't want to be. 
 So there she was, hating her dream job. She needed a break, so she started going out to bars on her own. Here she might not be herself, but she could pretend to be more successful and have complete control of the situation. 
 But then Will came along. Going out with him was different. She was completely out of control, but very much herself - and loving it.
