 Renewed Customer Service Focus at Job Centers 
 At WorkSource Montgomery we are dedicated to providing both businesses and job seekers the best experience we can offer. This dedication pushed us towards a critical decision to expand our partnership with Grant Associates, a nationally acclaimed workforce development company, to deliver American Job Center activities in Montgomery County. 
 Grant Associates will focus on providing services for job seekers across a variety of demographic areas and levels of need. The centers will offer resume building and job search workshops, credential attainment and training, and job search assistance, including access to job listings in the Maryland Workforce Exchange System. Labor Market Information, access to computer labs and job referrals will also be available. One of the cornerstones of Grant Associates’ service model is to build proactive relationships with businesses, both for-profit and non-profit, that result in direct access to job opportunities leading to employment. 
 Since 2016, Grant Associates has been providing similar services to the County’s youth residents through the WorkSource Montgomery Young Adult Opportunity Center. In addition to career services, this program provides internships for youth to gain work experience as well as a variety of training and credentialing options. 
 “We’ve been very pleased with the work Grant Associates is doing with the WorkSource Montgomery Young Adult Opportunity Center,” said Ellie Giles, CEO of WorkSource Montgomery. “Their expertise as a convener and collaborator of County resources and their connection with strong employment opportunities will drive economic development and enhance quality of life through the empowerment of more county residents to enter high-demand sustainable career pathways. WorkSource Montgomery’s board and stakeholders strive for continuous improvement and service expansion to best serve Montgomery County.” 
 As part of its new expanded services through the American Job Centers, Grant Associates will provide employer service resources to a wide range of businesses in key sectors to build the talent pipeline for the county’s employers. Grant Associates will use a market-driven approach to identify hiring needs and drive the area’s economic development by working diligently to connect businesses with the hundreds of skilled workers in the county. The company will also assist employers with posting their available jobs in the state’s Workforce Exchange System, connect employers to training resources, and design and execute custom solutions for industry-wide skill shortages. 
 “We are excited to expand our demand-driven approach to career and business services to include both youth and adult workers in Montgomery County,” said Doug Cotter, President of Grant Associates. “We’ve seen some great successes in the Montgomery Youth program where we’ve developed strong relationships with businesses and other community partners, and we’re eager to build on those and bring similar successes to the American Job Centers.” 
 Grant Associates will employ a staff of 19 between two Centers to provide a full suite of services to the more than one million residents in the County.
