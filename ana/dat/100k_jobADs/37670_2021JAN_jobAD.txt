 Career Choices 
 Well, after the whole fiasco with my Rockstar last week about the "shitty jobs" I demean myself for, I am happy to report that I now possibly have options. 
 While I was still contemplating kicking his butt-headed ass to the curb, (technically I would have to be the one to leave) I perused Craigslist for any jobs that looked "worthy" of his praise. I ended up applying online for several, and am happy to report that I actually heard back from a few of them. Now, I was watching the news yesterday, and there seems to be a Craigslist killer out there somewhere. They have apprehended some suspects, but my Rockstar had better hope that his judgemental attitude doesn't get me raped and chopped up into little pieces. 
 Anyhoo, when I was at work this weekend, my boss Frenchie and I had a discussion. It seems that we have less than stellar cooks employed with us, and I suggested that he fire their asses and hire me as a cook. Cooking is certainly not my final goal in life (I am still trying to figure out what that final goal would be) but if it will keep Frenchie from hiring some dumb asstard who can't learn how to decorate a pizza, so be it. We then discussed the possibility of my becoming a manager, and Frenchie stated, "This is an excellent idea. I don't know why I never thought of it before." I know why. Because he was busy looking at my ass. ðŸ™‚ 
 So, I begin training to cook this week, and I shall prove how completely adept I am. Then we' shall see what happens from there. Then, when I am making millions and living on my yacht, I can look at my Rockstar and say, "See? You just had to have a little faith in me,"

 I was wondering when you were going to come visit meâ€¦ Yes, but you must specify because there's the other sassy oneâ€¦ the one who doesn't do anything.

 Well, I've already proved it to some people, and really even if I'm not very good, it can't get worse than the cooks we have nowâ€¦.

 "This week you're mopping floors, next week it's the friesâ€¦." I delivered pizza while I got an MBA. I've delivered pizza probably 7 years of my life. Pizza is good. Pizza is a vegetable.

 I've been wondering if I actually want to deliver. Those guys made oodles of cash!

 You do. It's kinda cool driving by yourself, listening to your stuff, seeing things you wouldn't normally see. And though it's about 85-90% completely normal people, the rest are psychotic, crazy, funny, smelly, or any one of a number of interesting or quirky character traits. 
Folding boxes is the suck, though.

 It's not exactly a promotion yet, but Frenchie said he's banking on me not to go anywhereâ€¦
