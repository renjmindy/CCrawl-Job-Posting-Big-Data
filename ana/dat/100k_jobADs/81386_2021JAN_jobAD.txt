 HOW TO TAKE INSTAGRAM PHOTOS 
 You don't need a fancy camera or a professional photographer to take a great insta-worthy picture. All the pictures featured in this post were taken with an iPhone! All you really need is the following: 
 1-Smartphone  - I use the iPhone8Plus - the camera on this phone is outstanding and it allows you to take blurry background photos if you take a close up, like the Daniel Wellington picture below! 
 2-An editing app  - Sometimes the lightening is simply not ideal, so you need to play around with the exposure and contrast. I love to use VSCO. I know a lot of bloggers out there are also using Lightroom and create really nice presents, but I haven't had a chance to play around with it yet. It's on my To-Do list! In general however, be mindful of where the sun is positioned, you never want to shoot against the sunlight, always have the sun facing you during daytime. 
 3-A great background:  A picture looks so much nicer when there is a cool background. Since I'm in Toronto, I've been abusing of the CN tower backdrops, but do you blame me? It simply looks amazing and makes every photo look extra ;) I recommend choosing a background that fits your feed. If you're telling a city story, choose a background that shows the concrete jungle, on the opposite side, if you're telling a vacation story, the backgrounds should be fun and colorful unless you prefer neutrals, and so on. 
 4-An Instagram husband or Instagram friend  : LOL - you need someone to take the shot! And like I said, it doesn't need to be a professional. You can frame the photo yourself and have someone else just click! It took me 3 years to finally get my husband to become my sort-of-once-in-a-while Instagram husband! He used to hate doing this because I'm "picky" (apparently), but since we came to Toronto, I've been having a hard time finding a photographer that is affordable, so I started asking him to help out more and more, and we actually started to enjoy working together. So, in the past couple of weeks, he's been taking photos for me with my iPhone. So far, so good ;) I finally found a photographer here in the city, but my hubby will still remain my main picture-taker! 
 5-Square format:  Especially important to use the square format if you are having someone else take the picture and you want it to fit nicely on your feed. Ideally, a full size photo is best and I find it produces better quality pictures, but if you want to make sure the frame is done right, use the square format.
