 What to do if you are injured on the Job? 
 A common question this Illinois Workers ' Compensation Attorney is asked is, "I got hurt at work, now what do I do?"My response is: 
 
 Get Medical help. If it is an emergency go the Hospital immediately, otherwise schedule an appointment with your doctor and get seen as soon as possible. If you see your family doctor ask for a referral to an experienced specialist depending on your specific injury. If you are unsure you can contact my office and I can provide you with a list of reputable and professional physicians specific to your individual injury. 
 Call my office as soon as possible so I can start to review your case and make recommendations. 
 Start to keep records of your doctor appointments. E.g. Who did you see? What did he/she say? What did he/her prescribe or recommend, etc.? 
 Inform your employer as soon as possible of your work injury. Call your boss/supervisor and let them know what happened if they do not know already. If you are unable to contact your boss/supervisor then call your human resources department; and write down who you told, what you said, what they said and how you described your work accident.

 Be careful when you are signing documents. Only sign documents that are necessary for you to obtain medical care. Do not sign any other documents relating to your injury. If you have any questions relating to any documents you can bring them to my office for review. 
 Do not discuss your accident with anyone except close family members and myself. Except for initially notifying your boss/supervisor/human resources of your work accident, do not discuss your accident with anyone else especially any insurance company. It will be necessary to discuss your accident with your treating physician and maybe others but I prefer you consult with myself first.

 Caring about the Injured Worker's Situation 
 At the Law Offices of Gerald Bauer Jr. you are not simply a case number but a real person that matters to my office. My personal concern for each of my worker's compensation clients stems from a time where as an adolescent my father injured his back at work and could not return to his job as a truck driver. His work injury and subsequent loss of income put an undue amount of stress on my parents and almost caused them to lose my childhood home. 
 Luckily for my father he found an experienced Illinois Workers' Compensation lawyer that helped him get the medical care he needed and the financial award he deserved. It is from that personal experience as a young boy that I take and keep with me as I help each of my work injury clients.
