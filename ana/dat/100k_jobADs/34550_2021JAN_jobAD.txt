 Why is there always one 
 July 19, 2019   lindakempwriter 
 My mobile rang this afternoon; the number not from within my contacts, but also not withheld. 'Hello, this is Linda,' I answered in a cheery tone, despite a heavy, sinking feeling in my stomach.

 Take courage! 
 May 15, 2019   lindakempwriter 
 Tomorrow is a day of drawing on all my stores of courage. Two job interviews. One job desperately needed. Outstanding performance of a stellar, prospective employee to be displayed.
