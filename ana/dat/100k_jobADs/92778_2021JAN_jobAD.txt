 When should I not accept a job?

 Since starting a job relies on you being able to submit results on time, we'd suggest that you avoid starting jobs when you expect anything to interfere with that. 
 Results must be submitted before the deadline to guarantee that they won't be automatically rejected and passed onto another Genius.
