 Coach Profile 
 Pamela J. Green, MBA, SPHR, ACC 
 How will clients benefit with you as their coach? 
 My clients always walk away with a good sense of who they are, where they want to go, how they will get there and who/what can help them achieve their goals. They will feel a strong sense of motivation accompanied by realistic plan forward after working with me. 
 What results have clients reported after working with you? 
 Promotions, improved relationships, improved sense of self-worth, and a feeling of being focused and headed in the right direction. 
 What do clients say about working with you? 
 Pam has taught me that clarity and focus are two important elements. With her help I was able to effectively design a dynamic and transferable action plan for my professional and personal life. Thank you Pam! 
 P. Bloomfield, M.A. Ed. 
 The main challenges I experienced were exposed and addressed with this intensive coaching. I will continue to leverage this experience as a business leader as a result of my time spent with Pam. 
 Jennifer C., MBA 
 Working with Pam Green helped address career and staff challenges that I faced while providing me with tools that I can use long term. In addition, the ability to work with a coach who understands leadership and the environment in which I work was an added bonus for me. 
 W. Little-Coffey, MBA CAE 
 "I found the Mastermind to be an extremely rewarding experience. The exercises & group discussions were thought provoking & helped me to evaluate what changes I needed to make to help further my career. Having the support of other women in the field was invaluable, as having shared a lot of the same experiences we were able to bounce ideas off of one another & collect honest & credible feedback. To receive the superior level of direction & training from a seasoned HR professional such as Pam Green in any other career development program would've been highly unlikely. I'd recommend the Mastermind to any woman seeking to take her HR career to the next level & simply needing some support & direction to accompany her on her journey." 
 Tiffany H. 
 "...The opportunity to connect with HR professionals at all levels and work collectively to build upon our individual skills is invaluable. Pamela Green, is a true professional and I'm honored to have had the opportunity to work with her on both an individual and group level." 
 Jalisa G. 
 What is your coaching philosophy? 
 I believe in putting people at ease and helping them to see who they are and where they are so they can put their energies into moving in the right direction. I enjoy working with clients who are ready to take their brands, their careers, and their organizations to the next level. I believe that that given the right support everyone can achieve breakthrough performance and results. My primary role as the coach is to help illuminate what already exists within my client and then work to help them pave the way to their next big thing. 
 What strengths do you have as a coach? 
 
 I bring real world experiences (from staff to c-suite and board levels) to every coaching relationship. This experience allows me to adjust my coaching style to meet the client where they are now and to help guide them to where they want to go. 
 I listen on a deep level, especially to what isn't being said by my client. 
 I am active and credible in the business community, which makes me relatable to my clients. 
 I ask provocative questions to promote thinking and insights and provide relevant tools and resources to facilitate deeper learning. 
 I work with the client to co-create positive results; so the change the client is seeking is achieved and sustained. 
 
 What types of clients do you work with? 
 Most of my clients are mid to executive level business professionals and leaders who work within for-profit and non-profit organizations. 
 What is your professional background? 
 I am a collaboration, conflict resolution and coaching leader with more than 30 years of professional experience having served as a Supervisor, Manager, Director, Chief Executive, Board Chair and now as President of Pamela J Green Solutions, LLC. 
 I have earned a Bachelorâ€™s of Science Degree and my MBA from Franklin University in Columbus, Ohio. In addition to my education, I hold certifications as an Internal Conflict Coach (ICC), an SPHR from the Human Resource Certification Institute (HRCI) and a Professional Certified Coach (PCC) from the International Coach Federation (ICF). 
 After nearly 10 years with the American Red Cross, I joined SHRM as Regional Director and within 18 months was promoted to Chief Membership Officer, where I served as the chief promoter of global membership, member engagement, and retention initiatives. My work resulted in year over year revenue and membership growth during an economic recession and launched a demand for my speaking, training and facilitation expertise. 
 After a wonderful relationship with SHRM, my desire to enhance the leadership expertise of professionals in the business community grew stronger. With these goals in mind, I became a Business Strategist, Management Consultant and Executive Coach, where I now focus on helping business leaders avoid strategic drift and achieve business outcomes. Over the past 8 years I have applied Process Facilitation, Consultation, Coaching, Change Management, Team Building, Training and Development approaches to help clients achieve their organizational and professional goals.
