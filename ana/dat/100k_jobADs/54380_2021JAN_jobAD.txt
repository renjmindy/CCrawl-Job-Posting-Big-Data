 The Company 
 BenevolentAI unites technology with human intelligence to re-engineer drug discovery and deliver life-changing medicines. We have developed the Benevolent Platform®, a drug discovery platform built on powerful data foundations with state of the art machine learning and AI technology. Our technology empowers scientists to decipher the vast and complex code underlying human biology, find new ways to treat disease and personalise medicines to patients. Benevolent has active in-house R&D drug programmes in disease areas such as neurodegeneration, immunology, oncology and inflammation and has research and commercial collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and research organisations. 
 The company is headquartered in London with a research facility in Cambridge (UK) and a further office in New York. 
 Who we are 
 We are an eclectic bunch at Benevolent, united by our belief that innovative thinking and purposeful technology can truly change outcomes for the better. Our mission is to re-engineer drug discovery and deliver life-changing medicines for patients in need and we do this by applying AI, machine learning and other advanced technologies to reinvent the ways drugs are discovered and developed. We strive to bring together unique skills and perspectives across biology, chemistry, engineering, AI research, informatics, precision medicine and drug discovery. 
 The Role 
 Benevolent is hiring for biological scientists with a background or demonstrable track record in applied bioinformatics or biology-driven data science in drug discovery. These individuals, depending on experience, will join a team providing overall scientific and applied drug discovery direction to the growing BenevolentAI drug discovery platform and approaches. 
 Primarily facing the early drug target identification space, these individuals will be responsible for engaging with disciplines across the company ensuring new developments meet the needs and requirements of drug discovery across multiple disease areas. 
 Based at our London offices you will work closely with a diverse range of experts in biological sciences, chemical sciences, clinical, commercialisation, artificial intelligence, deep/machine learning and informatics teams to enrich the expanding BenevolentAI drug discovery portfolio. 
 Primary Responsibilities 
 
 Provide scientific leadership and requirements for BenevolentAI platform development in multiple domains, representing the needs of drug discovery users with a wide range of partners and stakeholders. 
 Develop and deploy scientifically rigorous methods to evaluate and measure the impact of new AI/ML methods in enabling new drug target evaluation.
 
 Based on drug discovery and/or biological experience, make data driven decisions to advance approaches to impact drug target identification. 
 
 
 Collaborate and partner widely across different domains and disciplines within Benevolent to represent the needs of drug discovery in new technology developments, evaluation, roll-out and use. 
 Responsible for regularly reporting progress and issues with clear strategic recommendations to Senior leadership, Board of Directors, and/or Investors as and when required. 
 
 Additional Responsibilities 
 
 Contribute to Benevolent portfolio activities by participating in target identification for diverse diseases/mechanisms using the Benevolent AI/ML driven target identification platform. 
 Contribute to external collaborative relationships with academic leaders and contract research organisations as required. 
 
 We are looking for someone with 
 
 BSc / MSc / PhD in biological sciences with 2+ years industry research experience, preferably consisting of real applied bioinformatic or ‘big data’ approaches in disease-focussed biological research.
 
 You are likely to have a background in a biological discipline, with some exposure to bioinformatics methods, and demonstrable track record in communicating needs and interpreting results with more informatics specialist colleagues. 
 
 
 Experience of early drug discovery and drug target identification, and demonstrable understanding of the role AI/ML can have here. 
 Experience of successfully working in multi-disciplinary drug discovery & development teams, with excellent communication skills and the ability to forge productive relationships and collaborations both internally and externally. 
 Ability to work under pressure, manage different projects and deliver to defined timelines. 
 Evidence of creative thinking and problem solving, confidently applying novel strategies to move projects to important decision points quickly and efficiently. 
 
 Nice to haves 
 
 Experience of leading drug discovery target validation programmes into chemistry optimisation desirable but not necessary. 
 Experience in one or more areas of human disease or mechanistic pathways associated with disease, such as neurodegeneration, inflammation, fibrosis, diseases of aging or oncology, is desirable.‍ 
 
 Together, we envision a world in which no disease goes untreated. If you are benevolent, curious, want to tackle real world problems and are willing to embrace new ideas, hit that ‘apply’ button and join us.
