 About Yoto: 
 Yoto is an interactive audio platform founded by experienced entrepreneurs that aims to change the way children access audio content. The Yoto ecosystem revolves around a curated library of stories, music, activities, sound effects, podcasts and radio. Children listen to the content on Yoto Player, a safely connected speaker that is controlled using physical cards with NFC technology. Additionally, the Yoto App allows parents to retain a level of control, enabling volume control, remote play and more. 
 We launched our first hardware product, Yoto Player, on Kickstarter in November 2017, reaching its funding target after only 5 days, and receiving a Red Dot Design award in the process. The product shipped for Christmas 2018 to a great customer reaction. Our partners include Roald Dahl Story Company, Penguin Random House, Hachette, Macmillan, Harper Collins, Naxos, Storynory and more. Luke Kelly, grandson of Roald Dahl and MD of the Roald Dahl Story Company, is on our board, and we are well-funded - backed by leading investors. 
 At the start of 2020, having worked with Pentagram on the redesign of the product and our brand, we relaunched Yoto Player. Since then, and despite certain major world events, sales have been doubling (and sometimes tripling) MOM, we've launched UK and US websites, won multiple awards including TIME's Best Invention 2020, had a tonne of good press across the world and started to build some great buzz.
