 Katherine (Kit) Prendergast, PCC, CMCC 
 "Powerful partnerships for powerful results! Have you been thinking about making a career change but are unsure how to even begin?

 What do clients say about working with you? 
 
 
 “Kit helped me get ‘unfragmented’, helping me decide my career goals FIRST and then, second, looking at how those fit into the job market. (I was doing it backwards.) As I worked with Kit, things began to come together very quickly and suddenly I had job interviews for positions I really wanted.”  – Judith Harlan 
 
 
 “Kit -You are one of a kind to me, and I would highly recommend you as the best in the world at helping floundering (not to mention older!) job and career seekers such as myself to find their way! . . . She has a rare and refreshing knack for guiding you through your job search process, while giving you just enough feedback, and interjecting just the right information, using her incredible wealth of knowledge. All this will gets you right where you need to be. Kit, I can never thank you enough for what you did for me!!  – Kathy Watson, Reno, Nevada 
 
 
 “Kit did an amazing job supporting me through my career/life change into my dream job. Her natural ebullience and genuine concern for me and my quest really helped keep me focused and energized. Kit’s contacts within the community were also extremely helpful resources. Without her expertise and guidance I wouldn’t have come so far so fast. I would recommend career counseling, and Kit in particular, to anyone needing a career boost. She was invaluable. Thanks, Kit!!”  – Laura Conrow 
 
 
 “Kit Prendergast is a joy to work with. She’s extremely upbeat, positive and encouraging. She guided me intuitively and wisely to discover my career path. She worked hard to help me develop and keep focused on my goals. I would recommend her highly to anyone seeking a career coach. She is truly inspirational.”  - Laura Howcroft 
 
 
 “Wanted you to know how much I appreciated the call, Kit. It’s funny that all of a sudden the resistance leads to mulling it over and that to consideration and then, realization: ‘Gee that’s terrible; that’s not the me I want to be.’ The recognition of the habit or disorder or whatever we call it – just recognition of the issue and giving it a name the client/patient can “get”. This is a work in progress. Thanks for showing me the path”  - Peggy McGraw

 What is your coaching philosophy? 
 
 
 
 Powerful partnerships for powerful results. It’s very difficult to make significant career and life changes alone. We all need to have that partner that really believes in us. A person that helps us clarify what we really want in this next chapter of our lives and then with wisdom, the right questions and with a touch of humor actively moves us forward. So if you are ready to create a new future for yourself, then partnering with me may be just what you need to move your dreams ahead today – not tomorrow.
