 September 19, 2019 
 Not all of us are fortunate enough to land our dream job, a.k.a the kind of job we dreamed about having when we were kids. 
 For some, a dream job would be becoming a police officer, a fireman, a soldier, or any other job you would be thrilled to have. You should consider yourself lucky if you land your dream job at some point in your life. 
 
 
 Perhaps the most perplexing part of the hiring process is that many people end up in jobs that don't line up with what they studied in high school and/or college. For example, you may have studied law, but could have ended up balancing ledgers in a commercial firm for a living. If you want to find out what careers you'd thrive in, take this  free decoder quiz ! 
 It's one thing to pursue your dream job, but it takes time and dedication to actually land it. 
 If you're chasing your dream career, follow tips for your chance at success! 
 Realize That It's Not Enough To Dream 
 First and foremost, it's important to narrow down what exactly your dream job is. Anybody can dream, but it takes hard work to turn this dream into reality. 
 It's important to know who you are, your strengths and weaknesses, and how you can effectively use those strengths and remove your weaknesses. A good approach to this is to be calm and positive, as well as objective. 
 Finally, determining what your dream job is based on your strengths, competencies and capabilities are all great first steps in realizing your career goals and dreams. 
 Put Yourself In Your Dream Employer's Shoes 
 Both employers and employees need to benefit from one other in the hiring process. 
 From an employer's perspective, it is in terms of finding solutions for their problems and contributing to the overall goals and objectives of business. As a candidate for your dream job, you need to think of how well you can provide value-addition to the company, and how you can use your skills to better the company as a whole. This type of thinking will set you apart from other candidates. 
 Effectively Sell Your Skills 
 Companies operate in competitive environments, and because of that, it's necessary that those in pursuit of their dream careers need to make some personal and organizational sacrifices. Effective skill selling means you take your qualifications, experiences, skill sets, and competencies and use them to attract and retain prospective employers. 
 While it is necessary to present your credentials in fair light, it's also important to substantiate facts and evidences. However, you shouldn't sell yourself short, as doing that could hinder sustainable career growth and development. 
 Consider What Your Daily Life Would Be Like In Your Dream Job 
 There are lots of reasons to pursue dream jobs, including growth prospects and job satisfaction. These reasons need to be nurtured and satisfied in the dream job. 
 It's also important to consider that your concept of a dream job may change over time, and what may have been considered a dream job before may not be the case anymore. 
 You need to identify if your skills and competencies are in sync with market realities before making the final call on a dream job. You should create focused plans and strategies aimed at helping you land a job you'll love. 
 Remember, when looking for your dream job, you should consider blend of rewards and growth opportunities, as well as map out a plan to meet your goals head-on.
