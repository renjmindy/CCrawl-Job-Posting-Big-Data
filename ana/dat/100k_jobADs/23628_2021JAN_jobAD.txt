 Great topic! You don't really think about their jobs until something like this pops up! But I'll guess I'd add Meg Cabot's characters-lots of teen princesses, celebrities, and rulers of the underworld lol!

 I love this topic! Dessert Developer sounds pretty awesome. I would have a problem with wanting to taste everything though and that wouldn't really work out in my favor. Haha.

 Great topic choice! Suite Scarlett by Maureen Johnson is about a family running a small hotel in New York City, which is really fun.

 Thanks! I'll need to look up Suite Scarlett. Running a hotel would be fun! I have a co-worker that wants to open a bed and breakfast when he retires from his current job and he tells me all the time I can come run it for him üôÇ
