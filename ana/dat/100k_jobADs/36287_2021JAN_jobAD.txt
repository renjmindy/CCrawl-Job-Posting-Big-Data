  How To Be A Job Search Superstar  
 Rosa Elizabeth Vargas 
 April 11, 2013 
 The  job search  competition is fierce - there's no denying that. All the career gurus are advising you to build your brand, get online, tap into the hidden market, launch a strategic job search campaign... but, have we failed to tell you that you need to be a superstar? With so many qualified professionals seeking employment, it's not enough you are competent, smart, and experienced. Nope, it is not. Your self-marketing must pack power, make a memorable impression, and "wow" your prospective employers. 
 
 How To Be A Job Search Superstar 
 What makes one a superstar in the realm of job hunting and career management? A  job search superstar  is... 
 1. A Subject Matter Expert (SME) 
 First of all, know your industry’s ins and outs. Stay abreast of the latest (keep your finger on the pulse), so you offer trending knowledge and competitive skills, which cannot be easily found in someone else, and, certainly, cannot be resisted. Many professionals become comfy in their zone and don't seek to acquire new skills. Predict what may be needed in the future in order to remain center stage. 
 2. Confident 
 No matter how strong your  job search tactics , your inadequacy and insecurity will be perceived. How do you build confidence? Work on being an SME and believe in your value. Plus, be courageous and promote your talent. Moxie anyone? So many job seekers make the mistake of not tooting their own horn (and those that easily do often shouldn't). Know HOW you are brilliant. Ensure you can "emanate" your prowess, and, ooh baby— let the world see your glow! 
 3. Singing The Right Tune To The Right Audience 
 This is where you need to clarify the topic of personal brand. Many job seekers are now focusing on personal branding, but guess what— if your personal brand (reputation) is not aimed at the right audience or is not 'beaming' the right message, your personal brand equals - nada! Without the right message (super-stardom), you are one of many who just slapped on the “brand” label to a nothing-special candidacy; this, making your light as dim as the rest. 
 4. Packaged As A Star 
 Hey, listen, I am no Beyonce - I promise you that, but my point is a polished online presentation, professional resume, attractive business cards, and elegant attire does matter! Sprinkle some stardust on your candidate packaging; twinkle with the right brand as a subject matter expert and with confidence at the right audience; and then gaze at how your super-stardom will star-struck all potential employers. As you radiate that special and bankable shine, someone will lasso you right into your dream job.
