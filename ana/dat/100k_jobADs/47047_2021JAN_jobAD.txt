 Canadian Job Search Sites 
 Actual Jobs Canada 
This site searches several job search sites. Beware of scams or non-job posts. 
 Canada Emploi 
This site is in French. I used "travail à la maison" (work at home?) and did get some results but I'm not certain all the jobs were work-at-home jobs. There are options for contract part-time work which are often conducive to working at home. 
 Canada Job 
This is the same site as Canada Emploi only in English. Typing "work at home" (in quotes) yielded many jobs but not all may actually be telecommuting positions so read the announcements carefully. 
 Canadian Jobs Catalog 
This site doesn't have jobs but lists many resources for finding jobs in Canada. 
 Work Search 
This is the English version of the site. It isn't really a search engine but rather a resource to job search sites for Canada and the United States. 
 Asia/Pacific Rim Job Search Sites 
 Asia-Net 
 Site says you need to download a special program to view but if you don?t you can still view the site in English. The site searchs in Asia, Pacific Rim, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Keep location and catagory boxes to "all", choose "English" (or whatever language you prefer) for the language. In the keyword box, "work at home" yielded the most results mostly in the U.S. and Japan. 
 Job Street 
Search Australia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malayssia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. To get the most results you need to register but it's free. 
 Australian Job Search Sites 
 Australian Job Search 
 I wasn't able to find work-at-home jobs using keywords used here in the United States. However, on the advanced search there is an option for "commission and self-employment jobs" 
which would offer possible work-at-home jobs. Incidentally, when searching on Australian sites from the United State you are searching one day ahead. Pretty neat! 
 Byron Employment Australia 
Only the advanced search yielded results. Leave "catagory" and "location" to "all". On "position basis" I used "contract". Under "keyword filter", I used keyword "work at home" and told the search that the result "must contain the exact phrase." 
 European Job Search Sites 
 Jobsite Group 
Large database of jobs throughout Europe. Keyword "telecommuting" yielded the best results. 
 United Kingdom Job Search Sites 
 CareerJet 
UK jobs search site. Use "telecommute" to search jobs. 
 Job Serve 
This site focuses in IT jobs in the United Kingdom. 
 Jobs Unlimited 
Keyword phrase "work from home" yielded the only results.
