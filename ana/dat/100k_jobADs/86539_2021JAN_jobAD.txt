 Web Fruit of Life 
 Published: 4 years ago  Bids: 7 
 Hi there, 
 I am starting a fruit salad delivery company and need a website project proposal ! 
I am from Brazil, so the website has to be in Portuguese. No worries, we can work together on the translations. 
The name of my company is Fruit of Life, and the website style should follow the logo style, with a clean and simple look! 
I have some ideas based on some websites I have seen and that I liked: 
·         www.dobem.com 
 ·         http://www.havaianas.com.br/pt-br/ 
 ·         http://www.yogurtlabs.com/ 
 Hope to have someone talented interested in delivering a nice website!
