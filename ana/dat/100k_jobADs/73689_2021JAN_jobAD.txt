 The Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics (WIAS) is an institute of the Forschungsverbund Berlin e.V. (FVB). The FVB comprises eight non-university research institutes in Berlin which are funded by the federal and state governments. The research institutes are members of the Leibniz Association. 
 The Research Group 
 " Partial Differential Equations"  **** 
 (Head: Prof. Dr. A. Mielke) at WIAS offers a position for a 
 PhD Student Position (f/m/d) 
 (  Ref. 21/01  ). 
 to be filled as soon as possible. The position is funded by the Collaborative Research Center SFB 1114 "  Scaling Cascades in Complex Systems  " within the subproject C05 _" Effective Models for Materials and Interfaces with Multiple Scales ". _ 
 Prerequisites for the position are a Master's Degree (or diploma) in mathematics, physics, or engineering. The successful candidate will have a sound background in applied analysis and experience in the mathematical modeling of continuum mechanics including. Knowledge in geometric structures (such as Poisson, Onsager, or Dirac structures) for mechanical system are advantageous. The willingness of interaction with other researchers within the SFB 1114 is expected. 
 Scientific inquiries should be send to Professor A. Mielke (alexander. mielke@wias-berlin.de ). 
 The appointment is time limited and will end on June 30, 2022. The salary is according to the TVoeD scale.
