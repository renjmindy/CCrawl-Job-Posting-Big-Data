 Police Officer Candidate Denied Job Due to High IQ 
 Posted on  March 26, 2014  by   Impartial Juror 
 This is but one face of what acceptable  bigotry  looks like in the United States: you can discriminate against a person for having too high of an IQ and deny them a job as a police officer. It's law as of 2000 in Connecticut at least. I wonder if it is a more widespread practice now?

 This is bigotry against intelligence. I thought our country was all about equality of opportunity (not equality of outcome as those with money like to remind us - in our capitalist society) and didn't practice bigotry in law? Oh wait, that's right, we're still practicing bigotry against homosexual couples. 
 What reason could they have beyond not wanting officers to not get bored and quit? Smarter officers would make better decisions right? Do we not want our officers to make better decisions? No, that's just crazy talk. You're all going to hell for reading this. Hell I tell you! Be afraid! Buy more! Be happy! 
 Yep, that's right, this is a story about Robert Jordan, the man who's too smart to be a cop. His IQ of 125 is too high. 
 Read about it from an 'original source' here:

 P.S. Look at the date on this article: 2000 CE. That's Current Era for all of you AD lovin folks.

 I hear you brother. 
 I was refused work at pizza hut because I had a good resume with work experience and a degree. They needed part time workers for the summer. I needed to horde away tips to try to move to a bigger city to get a job. 
 In the end it all seems to have worked out better than expected. ðŸ™‚
