 Funding for story concepts, OSIEA, deadline 14 August 
 Open Society Institute for Eastern Africa: 
 Call on creatives across Eastern Africa to submit concepts on story ideas: 
 **COVID-19 and Eastern Africa’s Stories of Innovation, Resilience and Solidarity 
Timelines/Duration: **This will run for three months – September, October and November 2020 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken all aspects of our lives. This spans health, economic, political, social to overall wellbeing.  In the midst of all these, the people of Eastern Africa are showing great promise in the way they are responding to this pandemic, including communities banding together to support each other through this very strange times. Many Eastern African countries have ignited their innovative instincts and have been able to take measures to bridge the medical supplies and protective gears gaps in some ways.. Governments have turned to local manufacturers and innovators to bridge these gaps. Young people in Universities are innovating to produce ventilators, community members are using their skills to produce face masks that they are distributing to community members that cannot afford them, while communities in low resourced neighborhoods are banding together to support each other to access food, sanitation services and other social amenities. Helplines are being established to support gender-based violence victims, while efforts are being made by communities to raise awareness to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in communities. 
 These are the stories reverberating across all Eastern Africa communities—the stories of innovation, resilience and solidarity. 
 Our Call and Purpose 
 As the Open Society Initiative for Eastern Africa, we would like to capture these stories in different forms to inspire communities across the region and enable learning and action even as we race against time to battle the COVID-19 pandemic and its devastating impacts. 
 We are therefore calling on creatives across Eastern Africa – Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, South Sudan, Sudan, Ethiopia, and Rwanda—to share with us a concept note on how they might capture these stories. 
 These could be captured as creatively written pieces, photo stories, short video stories, poems, creative designs, artistic expressions or simply podcast conversations among others. 
 These will cover innovations in the fight against COVID-19, how communities are coping despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, the initiatives by communities to contribute towards the fight against COVID-19, the resilience in the face of the pandemic among others. 
 Our Approach 
 We will pick two creatives per country who will submit five stories each (to have 10 stories per country) on different aspects of COVID-19 pandemic. The successful creatives will use different media to present the stories for diversity—integrating photo/short video clips to the written formats, arts among others. These stories will also cover diverse settings to ensure differentiation in terms of the experiences, coping mechanisms and responses. 
 How to Bid 
 Submit a concept giving examples of stories you would like to tell regarding COVID-19 in Eastern Africa that demonstrate innovation, resilience and solidarity. Indicate in what format you would wish to tell the story and the budget/how much it would cost you to tell the story. The concept should be 500 words or less. You can suggest up to five story ideas. 
 **Submit the concept to  **   romondi@osiea.org  **  and    wngunjiri@osiea.org  **  by August 14, 2020.

 Job: Communications coordinator, Sentinel Project 
 Reporting to the executive director, the communications coordinator will oversee the Sentinel Project’s social media platforms, website updates, newsletters, blog posts, and media outreach.  LINK 
 As a small organization, the Sentinel Project has spent its first decade building programs in Kenya, Myanmar, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and South Sudan. During that time, communications work has largely been the responsibility of volunteers or team members who have other primary responsibilities. The Sentinel Project is now working to expand both its activities and geographical coverage, which means that it needs a committed communications coordinator to actively work on outreach and provide a sustained voice for the organization. 
 The communications coordinator position will require a total of approximately ten hours per week for content creation, social media engagement, and collaboration with other members of the Sentinel Project team. This is a contract position. 
 Responsibilities 
 
 Coordinate communications strategy with members of the Sentinel Project team 
 Create and manage a real-time, collaborative editorial calendar 
 Write social media posts, blog posts, press releases, and other content for the Sentinel Project website and social media channels 
 Create and send a monthly newsletter to the organization’s existing subscriber base, which will involve drafting some content as well as editing content from contributors across the organization 
 Regularly engage the organization’s audience and community, particularly on social media, and track impact 
 Manage occasional media outreach efforts and pitch story ideas to reporters when appropriate 
 
 Requirements 
 
 Caring about helping people in conflict areas to defuse conflicts and prevent violence 
 Strong written communication skills, as demonstrated in your cover letter and links to samples of past work 
 Experience with creating and editing content in WordPress, Mailchimp, and other online publishing platforms 
 Comfort with using Google Apps, especially Google Drive / Docs, for online collaboration with a largely virtual team 
 Proficiency at using social media platforms in a professional capacity to engage and sustain an audience, preferably to include experience with social media analytics 
 Ability to manage workflows using databases, spreadsheets, task management tools, and other similar technologies 
 2+ years of supporting communications efforts in either the for-profit or non-profit sector 
 Experience working with non-profit organizations, especially in a fundraising capacity, is appreciated but not required 
 
 About us 
 Formed in 2008, the Sentinel Project is a small, global, non-profit organization dedicated to assisting communities threatened by mass atrocities through direct cooperation with the people in harm’s way and the innovative use of technology. Our team focuses on initiatives such as building networks to stop the spread of harmful misinformation that contributes to conflict and to warn people about violence if it does happen. We are a diverse group of people who are passionate about human rights and the ways that communications technology can improve lives. If you join our team, you will be part of an emerging approach to atrocity prevention and peacebuilding and will contribute to a meaningful cause within a rapidly growing organization. 
 The Sentinel Project is grateful to all applicants for their interest in our organization, though if you don’t hear from us within 30 days of applying you can assume that this position has been filled. Although only those applicants who are selected for an interview will be contacted, if you don’t hear from us right away we may still be keeping you in mind for future opportunities with our team. Our needs change constantly. 
 To apply 
 Please contact us at  joinus@thesentinelproject.org  with the following: 
 
 An updated resume or LinkedIn URL 
 A cover letter explaining how your background and expertise will ensure that you will excel in this role (include hourly wage expectations)
