 Is your boss victimizing you? 
 February 22, 2010 
 You donâ€™t want to get up in the morning because you have to go to the dreaded office.  You wish the day would just pass.

 Your boss thinks you incompetent, makes rude remarks when you alone and looks over your shoulder all day. Nothing is ever good enough. 
 
 Outbursts are also not uncommon by Mr. Boss.  Once you back home you wish tomorrow will never come.

 What are your options when victimized at work? 
 
 Accept the situation 
 Look for other work 
 Change the situation 
 
 How can you possibly change the situation? Firstly get support from other employees, family and friends. Secondly, find out what your rights are and how the grievance procedure of your company works. Thirdly, get expert help.
