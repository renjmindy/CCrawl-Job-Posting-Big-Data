 Pittsburgh Region Adds 24,600 Jobs; Unemployment Unchanged 
 The Pittsburgh region's job market roared ahead in April, posting the biggest monthly hiring spree in at least 25 years. 
 The seven-county metropolitan area added 24,600 nonfarm jobs and the unemployment rate remained stable at 5.3 percent as more people began a job search, according to preliminary data the Pennsylvania Department of Labor & Industry reported Tuesday. 
 It was the largest monthly gain on record since 1990, the earliest data available, and provided a nice boost heading into summer, PNC economist Kurt Rankin said. 
 “This is about as good a sign as we could get for the state of Pittsburgh's economy,” Rankin said.

 WILKES-BARRE, PA  – Following a recent pattern, the unemployment rate in the  Scranton/Wilkes-Barre  market fell in May, but so did the number of people with jobs. 
 The 7.2 percent rate was down one-tenth of 1 percent from April and 1.9 percentage points from the May 2013 rate of 9.1 percent, the state Department of Labor and Industry said. But the region that includes Luzerne, Lackawanna and Wyoming counties maintained the unenviable distinction of having the highest jobless rate in Pennsylvania. 
 Both the size of the labor force – people working or looking for work – and the number of people with jobs fell compared to April and over the year. So, while 6,100 fewer people were reported as unemployed than last May, some of them may have given up looking for work.

 Map of Pennsylvania highlighting Lancaster County (Photo credit: Wikipedia) 
 Lancaster County 's unemployment rate fell again in November, dipping to 5.9 percent from October's 6.1 percent, the state reported Friday. 
 In declining for the third straight month, the local jobless rate sank to its lowest point since December 2008, when it was 5.6 percent. 
 The new rate means the county continues to slowly make progress toward its pre-recession level of unemployment. 
 "It's taking a lot of time to settle down," said Bill Sholly, an analyst with the state Department of Labor & Industry.

 Lehigh Valley Unemployment Rate Lowest In More Than 4 Years 
 The Lehigh Valley's unemployment rate dipped below 8 percent in May for the first time in more than four years, another indication that the labor market continues to slowly recover from steep job losses inflicted during the Great Recession. 
 The Valley region's unemployment rate in May was 7.9 percent, down from 8.1 percent in April. It was last below 8 percent in February 2009. The Valley's unemployment rate remains higher than the state, 7.5 percent, and nation, 7.6 percent.

 The Real Fiscal Cliff: The 4.8 Million Long-Term Unemployed 
 Today's alarming financial news is the rise in first-time unemployment claims to 385,000, up 28,000 and also above expectations. The  U.S. Labor Department  report shows the labor market is weakening, not that it was anything resembling strong in the first place. It makes me want to cry, because every piece of news like this makes me even more distraught about the future of the  4.8 million  long-term unemployed. 
 I've covered unemployment issues or more than a decade and the future for those who are out of work beyond the normal six months funded by state benefits is very bleak. These aren't lazy bums, but desperate people who are financially and emotionally devastated by their situation.
