 Changes in job mediation opportunities for short term foreign workers 
 3. June 2020 
 As of June 01, 2020 it is possible for those short-term foreign workers who are currently unemployed, but have the right to continue working in Estonia in case they find a job, to receive job mediation from Unemployment Insurance Fund. Previously, an employee had to be at a previous job to receive a job mediation from Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund. Read more about it  here. 
 The job mediation service of the Unemployment Insurance Fund is free of charge for both job seekers and employers. Additional information is available from the Unemployment Insurance Fund offices or from the information line 15501.
