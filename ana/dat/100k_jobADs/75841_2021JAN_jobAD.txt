 Several construction and other industrial trade jobs made  our list of top jobs without a college degree . They are some of the highest paying and widely available jobs you can find. 
 Unionized trade jobs were once the definition of a "good job" for most families across the US and internationally. As more was invested to build infrastructure across the country, these are the jobs that build the way we live today. 
 Times have changed with the appearance of technology and robotics. More positions are being either replaced or assisted by some level of technology. Whether it's the machines operated at a construction site or the technology used to troubleshoot issues with the equipment you're repairing. 
 Due to the specialization of many industrial jobs, you will often be required to take training before beginning. This can range from online courses, classroom training, or even training in the field. 
 In several cases, you may need to do an apprenticeship to build your knowledge and expertise by working with those that have mastered the skills. Most companies will cover the costs associated with training and apprenticeships.
