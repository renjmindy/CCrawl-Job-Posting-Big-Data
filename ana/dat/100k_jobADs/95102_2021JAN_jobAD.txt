 The Best free and premium job sites in Canada 
 Nikoletta Bika 
 Senior Content Writer 
 
 Good job boards help you attract qualified candidates – and that’s why they’re strong allies in Canada’s  tightening  labour market. Competition for talent will be even more fierce as the  number of job vacancies increases  and employers will need to invest in the right channels to find the right people. To help you decide how to form a job posting strategy, we examine some of the best job sites in Canada. 
 Top 10 job sites in Canada for 2019 
 International job boards 
 Most global job boards and job search engines have local websites in various countries. They’re well-known among job seekers and many of them offer a resume database to help you source candidates. Here are some of the best international job boards with local versions in Canada: 
 Indeed Canada 
 The global mega-aggregator Indeed has various country-specific branches, including a  Canadian version . Indeed collects and displays jobs from other sites (like your  careers page ) for free, if the job ads meet its standards. Indeed also offers free and paid posting options right from its platform. You can benefit from integrations with search engines  WowJobs  and  SimplyHired , which was acquired by Recruit Holdings, Indeed’s parent company. (Recruit Holdings recently acquired  Workopolis  too). 
 Glassdoor 
 Glassdoor  is a global review site and job board (also recently acquired by  Recruit Holdings ). Millions of candidates visit this site to explore and leave reviews as well as look for jobs. This means that Glassdoor gives you both a platform to post jobs and an opportunity to  build up your employer brand . You can do this by responding to reviews and sharing information about your workplace (including photos and videos). 
 Monster Canada 
 One of the most visited job boards worldwide, Monster, has a popular  branch in Canada . This job board attracts millions of job seekers every month and has built an impressive resume database. When you post your job ad, Monster will recommend resumes that match your criteria, helping you find the best candidates faster. 
 CareerBuilder Canada 
 CareerBuilder Canada  is the local version of global employment site CareerBuilder. You can use this platform to post jobs (there are paid plans depending on the number of jobs you want to have posted simultaneously) or search the vast resume database for resumes that meeting your criteria. 
 The New World of Work 
 Both entry/mid and senior-level execs admitted that changing business logistics will be a huge challenge in the new post-COVID environment.

 Local job boards 
 There are several country-based job sites in Canada which are often very popular with local talent. Here are some well-known Canadian job sites: 
 Eluta.ca 
 This  Toronto-based job board  is branded as the “official job search engine of Canada’s Top 100 Employers project”, attracting millions of candidates annually. You can  display your job ads for free  on Eluta, provided they’re already published on your careers page. Or you can choose to  post a sponsored job ad  to increase visibility among job seekers. 
 Jobbank 
 The official government job board of Canada has two versions,  Job Bank in English  and  Job Bank in French  and it’s one of the best free job posting sites in Canada. Your job ad will reach job seekers from all provinces, both English- and French-speaking, and you can market it to groups of people, like veterans, indigenous peoples or people with disabilities. Job Bank will also show you a list of candidates who match your requirements. 
 Jobillico 
 Jobillico Canada  is based in Quebec and used by two million job seekers, according to its website. It has recently partnered with Job Bank, so if you have an account with Jobillico, your job ad will also appear there at no extra cost so you can reach more candidates. 
 Jobboom 
 Employers use Jobboom to post jobs mainly in Quebec. This job board is popular in the province and recently partnered with Google to  give job seekers better access  to its job postings. And, if you want to post summer jobs or internships, you  can do so for free . 
 Talent Egg 
 If you’re offering paid internships or summer jobs, or hiring recent graduates for entry-level roles across Canada,  Talent Egg  is a good option. You can choose among three pricing options that let you post branded jobs and build your employer profile. 
 This was our list of the Top 10 job sites in Canada. Did you know that with Workable you can post jobs for free with one click ?
