 Description of Work: 
 The University of Nebraska-Lincoln seeks a faculty member at the assistant or associate professor level in next-generation wireless communications. Next-generation wireless includes millimeter-wave (mmWave), terahertz (THz), free space optical, and intelligent surface communication systems. Next-generation wireless communication promises improved data rates, increased coverage, and access to new types of devices compared to legacy technologies. Improved bandwidth and coverage will enable a host of new applications in medicine, food, industry, and media.

This position is motivated by the Department's strategic plan to enhance its expertise in networking and systems areas. This goal builds upon the Department's existing strengths in communications and networking, robotics, embedded computing, data analytics, and software engineering. 
 As part of this initiative, the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (http://cse.unl.edu) invites applications for a faculty position at the tenure-track Assistant or Associate Professor levels. The successful candidate will contribute to the undergraduate and graduate academic programs within the department and demonstrate a commitment to excellence in both research and teaching.

UNL offers an outstanding infrastructure for conducting research, including a remotely accessible city-wide wireless testbed, an aerial robotics facility, a full range of computing facilities, and the Holland Computing Center (hcc.unl.edu). Opportunities for collaborations include the College of Engineering and the Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources.

 Minimum Required Qualifications:
