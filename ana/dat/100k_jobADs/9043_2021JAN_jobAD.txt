 Automate extraction using shell scripting 
 March 12, 2017   hemanth bitra   Leave a comment 
 You can automate extraction using shell script and sql script in four steps 
 1. Create a sql file 
 SET LINESIZE 110 
SET TERMOUT OFF 
SET ECHO OFF 
SET PAGESIZE 0 
SET HEADING ON 
SET FEEDBACK OFF 
SET UNDERLINE OFF 
SET TRIMSPOOL ON 
SET TRIMOUT ON 
SET VERIFY OFF 
SET ARRAY 500 
SET WRAP ON 
SPOOL /home/username/DateEx/extraction.dsv 
SELECT 'EMPNO;ENAME;JOB;MGR;HIREDATE;SAL;COMM;DEPTNO' FROM dual; 
select EMPNO||';'|| 
ENAME||';'|| 
JOB||';'|| 
MGR||';'|| 
HIREDATE||';'|| 
SAL||';'|| 
COMM||';'|| 
DEPTNO 
from emp; 
SPOOL OFF 
 Save this script as filename.sql [Ex. auto.sql] 
 2. **Create a shell script to connect sqlplus and run a script 
 ** 
 #!/bin/bash 
login=scott/tiger@pdborcl 
sqlplus $login <<EOF 
@auto.sql 
exit; 
EOF 
 Save the script as filename.sh [Ex. oracron.sh] 
 **3. Now create another shell scripting so that we can schedule cron job 
 ** 
 #!/bin/bash 
 
 /home/username/oracron.sh 2>&1 > /home/username/DateEx/stderr.log 
 
 Save this file as filename.sh [Ex. crons.sh] 
 4. Configuring cronjob 
 To configure cronjob 
 enter below command in command line 
 $crontab -e 
 and schedule as per your requirement 
 Example of cronjob 
 For every day at 12 am 
 0 0 * * * /path/to/script [Ex. 0 0 * * * /home/username/crons.sh] 
 For 3rd day of the every month at 12 pm 
 0 12 3 * * /path/to/script 
 For weekly job for monday to friday at 12pm 
 0 12 * * 1-5 /path/to/script 
 For yearly once in december from 1st 10 days at 11 am 
 0 11 1-10 12 . /path/to/script
