 Abstract 
 This study focuses on the employment difficulties of older workers in the Israeli labor market. Using administrative panel data for the years 2005â€“2010, it traces the employment transitions of workers and their consequences, focusing on age and gender differences. The findings show that in Israel older workers, men and women alike, are indeed less likely to leave their jobs. However, once out of the labor force, they face difficulties in finding new employment. These difficulties are severer for women than for men. Male workers who experience high instability experience job losses, with no substantial age differences. The wage penalties for women are much lower, probably because of their limited opportunities in terms of earnings. 
 Highlights 
 
 Older workers in Israel have higher job stability compared to younger workers. 
 Once leaving a job, older workers have more difficulties in finding new employment. 
 Women are more likely to experience difficulties in regaining employment compared to men. 
 Job transitions are associated with a loss of wage but older workers are not losing more than younger ones. 
 Job transitions are less costly for women than for men, probably because of initially lower wages.
