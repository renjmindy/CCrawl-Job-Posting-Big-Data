  When A Good Job Turns Into A Bad One  
 Tai Goodwin 
 December 14, 2013 
 When you have what most people consider a good job, it's easy to feel obligated to stay where you are. After all, you have what most people want, right? It may be true most people settle for a “good” job, but there are some of us who aren’t satisfied with that. We want work that feeds our passion. Work that has meaning that extends beyond a paycheck. We need work that lends itself to the lifestyle we want instead of a job that forces us into survival mode: just hanging on, tolerating Monday through Friday, and spending the weekend to detoxifying emotionally and mentally. 
 
 When A Good Job Turns Into A Bad One... 
 For anyone whose ambition is nudging you on to make your next career move, here are a few thoughts on breaking free after a good job turns into a bad one: 
 Know When It's Not Working 
 The first way to break free from the trap is to acknowledge it is just not working. Regardless of how anyone else feels or what anyone else likes, the life you live can only be experienced by you. If you are listening to other people (more than likely folks who are afraid to take their own journey), you are selling yourself short. Isn’t it time you stopped living someone else’s dream and started focusing on yours? 
 Don't Let Your Job Define You 
 Accepting a good job is something you do - not who you are. In many cases a good job requires you to compartmentalize, becoming two different people. You have the 9-5 full time job person who is just a shell of who you are. Then you have the after-work and weekend persona where you come alive. I’ve never been good at managing that kind of split. This isn’t about working all the time; it’s about being able to be 100% of you 100% of the time. 
 Realize Money ≠ Happiness 
 Realize making good money does not equal having a great lifestyle. Good jobs, especially good jobs that pay well can keep us leashed to a life that is less than we dream for ourselves. We tolerate assignments, conversations, and mediocrity on a full-time basis and still expect to have enough life left over for living. That’s tough. Money allows us to take care of ourselves and our family, but money alone won’t get us to lifestyle we need to feel fulfilled. Getting out of the trap of bad job requires creating success on your own terms instead of settling. It’s living out the experience of finding work that meets the requirements of your financial needs and aligns with your purposed passion. Even when it seems like having both a career you love and one that allows you to earn what you need, refuse to believe that you have to choose one over the other. The good news is you can escape after a good job turns into a bad one. The greater news is you are the key to your own freedom.  Enjoy this article? You've got time for another!
