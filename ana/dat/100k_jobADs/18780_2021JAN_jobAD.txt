 What Does YOUR Career Identity Say About You? 
 
 
 Or, are you thinking,  "Career Identity...What's THAT?"  A  Career Identity  is your professional persona. It is how you present yourself in the workplace and it has a major impact on your ability to achieve your career goals. Also known as  Personal Branding  , this is a hot topic when it comes to job search and career development. These days, employers expect candidates to have a strong understanding of their strengths and how they can leverage them for greater success. For example, if you can't articulate your  Career Story  (one of the tools needed for a strong Career Identity), then you could be missing out on valuable career advancement opportunities.
