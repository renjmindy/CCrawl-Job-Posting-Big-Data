 Joshua Bennett (US) to headline Word N Sound Poetry & Live Music Festival 2012 
 Award winning US Poet Joshua Bennett has confirmed his headline appearance at the second edition of the annual  Word N Sound Poetry and Live Music Festival . Schedule for 6 October in Newtown, the Festival will showcase new breed poetry and live music breaking ground in Gauteng. 
 “I can’t wait to be back in South Africa on October 6th. This show is going to be incredible!” Joshua Bennett 
 Joshua Bennett is an award winning performance poet from Yonkers, NY. He has recited his original work at events such as  President Obama’s Evening of Poetry and Music at the White House ,  The Sundance Film Festival,  The NAACP Image Awards , the ESPN documentary One Night in Vegas, and alongside former U.S. Poet Laureates Billy Collins and Rita Dove at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ. In addition, he was a featured poet on the original cast of the  HBO series Brave New Voices . He also was commissioned to create an original work for Ralph Lauren’s RUGBY ad campaign,  The Rugby Poets Club. 
 The Word N Sound Festival is part of the Word N Sound Poetry Development Series, a youth writing and performance project which is not so much a commercial venture as an attempt to make a positive impact on youth in the city. 
 Starting at 12 mid-day, the festival will kick off with The WNS Open Mic Challenge finale, where 5 finalists will compete for the title of Word N Sound Open Mic Champion and a grand prize. The Word N Sound Open Mic Challenge also known as the WNS Poetry League is an annual, 9 month long, poetry open mic challenge aimed at unearthing Gauteng’s aspiring writers and performance poets. 
 The event day will end with a highly anticipated performance by Joshua Bennett and various local poets (names to be released closer to the festival) including Afurakan, a local slam poet and arts activists. A creative arts market will provide patrons with insight into the Joburg crafts and publishing scene. 
 Simply described, the Word N Sound Festival is like a shot of lemon straight to the head and will leave spoken word enthusiasts entertained, inspired and with food for thought to take home.
