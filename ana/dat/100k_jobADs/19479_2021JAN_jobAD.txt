 Career Paths for New Librarians Workshop 
 The workshop was a tremendous success! Many M.L.I.S. students attended the event despite the rainy weather in the OC. 
 Thank you to all of the organizations who helped coordinate this spectacular event. 
 Orange County Chapter of REFORMA, SJSU SLIS, SJSU LISSTEN, and the California Librarians Black Caucus.
