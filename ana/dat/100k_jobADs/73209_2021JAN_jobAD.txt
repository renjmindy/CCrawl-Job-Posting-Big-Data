 An inside job on the pizza 
 Sick, tired and inspired. It's an awkward combination. It's been a long way with sick kids, a cranky Mummy running on too little sleep and too much caffeine, a stressed Daddy who was several hours late going in to work (doe to aforementioned sick kids) and all round one of those days where pretty much everything that could go wrong, did go wrong and then some. But despite it all I have been inspired this past week by the blog of a friend involved in the The Virtual Vegan Potluck who cooked a glorious  Serendipitous Stromboli  and today was the day for my tweaked up version thereof. 
 We try to cook all breaded foods with sourdough yeast rather than conventional yeast. The souring time that's involved removes much of the phytic acid that is found in grains like wheat etc and it means I am able to tolerate wheaten products so in order not to enjoy my meal tonight and then suffer through remorse tomorrow I make up a sourdough pizza dough recipe from the  GNOWFGLINS sourdough e-book  instead of the dough Narf7 made for her Stromboli I also tweaked our toppings, catering for 3 small children and for what I had in the pantry. Here's the photos of my Stromboli. 
 
 Dough, having soured for about 6 hours near Ignisa (the warmth speeds up the souring time) and spread with homemade tomato paste 
 
 With sliced onion and ham on top 
 
 With home bottled (canned) pineapple 
 
 And some grated tasty cheese (it looks messy as I had started to fold it up then unfolded it for the photo). 
 
 Folding it all up 
 
 Folding it all up 
 
 Both sides folded in and the ends tucked in too. I lined a slice tray (our baking trays are too big for Ignisa) the put the tray on top then turned the whole lot upside down. Some diagonal slices for prettying it up and a little bit of grated cheese that I had left over. 
 
 Ignisa's firebox burning away merrily cranking up the oven temperature. 
 
 Dinner is served. Tasted fantastic even if I do say so myself. 
 A photographer I am not, so sorry about the crappy photos but hey, I actually remembered to take them this time. ðŸ˜‰ And sorry too for the lame pizza joke too. ðŸ˜›

 You gave "wood fired gourmet pizzas" a run for their money there Jess! I bet it tasted gorgeous :). Its still raining here! That's 3 days for the soil bank and hopefully it has soaked in at least a few cm and softened our soil up a bit. I was supposed to be going to a native bush tucker workshop today but if it keeps raining it will be cancelled. Oh well, we are cracking through our studies and are well ahead now so that's a bonus. I am "dead chuffed" that you featured the Stromboli in a post and that it worked out just fine with a bit of tweaking :). Hopefully the hoppers and Martin liked it? How's your pond going? I think the lower echelons of Serendipity Farm is just about to turn into a pond all by themselves ;). I might just get those geese yet! (Probably migrating over from where Linnie is ðŸ˜‰ ). Have a fantastic day today and bake some bickies with the hoppersâ€¦nothing can't be fixed with a cup of beverage of your choice, a bit of a rest over a tray of fresh baked bickies! ðŸ™‚ (at least the hoppers mouths will be full and there will be silence, albeit for a few momentsâ€¦sometimes that is ALL you need ðŸ™‚ )

 We're actually all down and out with a cough at the moment. Orik had the hospital run yesterday morning with croup and all 5 of us are coughing. I'm feeling pretty rough to be honest. A cup of hot chocolate and some of the bikkie cakes I made yesterday will go down a treat. ðŸ™‚ 
The pond is no further along than it was when we marked out the outline unfortunately but then again it hasn't rained that much here either so I doubt the ground is softened much anyway. 
I have 2 garden beds I need to dig up (last seasons half rotted no dig beds) and put into the base of the last 2 of this seasons raised beds, and then I need to bring around 2 Trevor trailer loads of compost to top them up ready for planting. Then any extra compost goes into the new hugelkultur bed along with the loquat tree and the broad beans. I reckon Autumn is just about as exciting as Spring sometimes. 
Geese are good for keeping down the grass so it's not all that bad an idea, as long as you have some form of grass. 
And yep, all adored the Stromboli so I call that a win. ðŸ™‚

 We have been flat out doing our assessments. A good thing too, it hasn't stopped raining in 3 days :). Great for us digging holes when it stops on Friday and I can see our veggie garden getting built this weekend ðŸ™‚

 I desperately want a wood fired oven! Pizzas in the are the best. I love the idea of a wrapped pizza!

 Inside out pizza's (which is what we told the kids was for dinner) are no much, if any less messy than the normal ones but they are somehow better. ðŸ™‚ I've also made what I call surprise bread rolls which is normal bread dough with the pizza ingredients popped inside and sealed up. If they don't leak (which 50% of them seem to do) then they look just like a bread roll and the kids eat them thinking lunch is boring and whammo! In the middle is deliciousness. ðŸ˜€ 
Our wood oven is really a wood heater with a stupendous cook top and an ok oven. In hindsight part of me wishes we had put in a proper wood fired stove and moved the kitchen around somewhat as we're using Ignisa to cook almost exclusively now she's alight permanently but we had no idea how much we'd love cooking on her. ðŸ™‚ Still and all, 'Nisa is doing a marvelous job and now we're getting used to how she works there is a lot less burned food coming out of her. ðŸ˜‰ 
Have you seen Gavin Webber, from greeningofgavin.com.au 's outside cob oven? One of those would be well awesome hey. ðŸ™‚

 I love your variation, rabid! I'm going to re-blog it, as I can see that people with wheat sensitivities might like it. I've always loved ham n pineapple pizza ('though we only ate bought pizza once or twice a year), but I never made that variety myself. I used to make a deep-dish pizza with tonnes of veggie fillings and sauce, and cheese, of course. If I remember rightly, I used hamburger, crumbled and sauteed, for meat sometimes. My boys sure devoured it, either way! 
 Hope you and the permies are all well soon. No fun when everyone's sick, is it? ~ Linne

 Not fun at all being sick but the kids have done well as they've watched Lady and the Tramp and onto their 3rd run through of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang which they love. Cheering me up no end too. ðŸ™‚ 
I think with pizza, as with Stromboli, anything goes. Eggs, seafood, vegetarian, vegan, meat lovers, Hawaiian (ham n pineapple) and any and everything in between. ðŸ™‚

 I think you have a thing for your oven. ðŸ™‚ Looks great and next time i visit im putting in an order. I think even my kid would eat it, minus the pineapple and that's saying something. Imagine a slice of this with a nice warm chowder. I want an ignisa too ðŸ˜¦

 That looks really good! I need to try that recipe for our crust. We used to do a pizza every Friday night and we used to do one homemade. I'd really like to get back into the habit of that. So sorry you guys have been under the weather. ðŸ˜¦ Hope all of you get to feeling better soon.

 Thanks Jenny, so do I, if only to have kids sleeping through again. ðŸ™‚ 
I think Stromboli might well become a Friday night fixture here too.

 Sick kiddos is no fun at all. The last four weekends in a row someone has been sick here. Maybe I should make some 'insideout pizza'- I do believe there are healing properties in any kind of pizza ðŸ™‚ 
 (On another note, you couldn't do it as folded one, but I've been playing with a sprouted buckwheat and broccoli pizza base- (normal toppings), no wheat at all. Works a treat and I'm hooked on it.

 I've heard of cauliflower pizza base but not broccoli. Are you willing to share the recipe?
