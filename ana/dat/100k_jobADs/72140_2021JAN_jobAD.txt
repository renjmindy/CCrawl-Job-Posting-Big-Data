 How the 2018 International Astronautical Congress in Bremen is becoming a reality 
 Bremen, October 2018: around 4,000 industry experts from all over the world are in the city to attend the International Astronautical Congress. But it's not just at the congress that people are talking about space. It is also a topic of conversation in pubs, schools and even nurseries. The organising committee is working flat out to make sure this all becomes a reality. Birgit Kinkeldey is part of the committee that is based at the  Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity (ZARM) .  In this interview , she and Peter von Kampen talk about programming and planning for the world's biggest space industry conference  - the theme which is 'Involving everyone' - and about good news from Mexico.

 Dual citizenship due to the Brexit vote 
 Fiona Moore is originally from Burton-on-Trent, near Birmingham, UK, and now works as a freelance translator in Bremen. She fell in love with Bremen in her early twenties. That was back in 2000, but she is still as enchanted by the city now as she was on the first day. The Brexit vote made her decide to apply for German citizenship - now she has dual nationality.  In this interview, she tells us about the importance of the EU passport for her, settling in Bremen and being fortunate to have found a home in here.

 Living and Working on the moon and on Mars 
 One day, astronauts will live and carry out research on the moon - and even a colony on Mars is no longer the distant utopian dream it once was. But how will people be able to live in an extraterrestrial environment? That is what Dr Christiane Heinicke is researching and developing. The geophysicist is working at the Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity (ZARM) at the  University of Bremen . After studying and working in Germany, Sweden, Finland and Hawaii, she and her team are developing a housing facility which could be used on the moon or on Mars in the future. Her MaMBA (Moon and Mars Base Analog) project focuses on the technical aspects of the housing units.  Read more about her story in our article "Moon Living" .
