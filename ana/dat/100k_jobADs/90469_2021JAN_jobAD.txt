 Over the years, researchers have determined that when you are exposed to asbestos, whether it is at work, home, or simply through second-hand exposure, that exposure can be deadly. It is an employer’s job to protect their employees and contractors when it comes to asbestos exposure. This does not necessarily mean that the building you work in does not have asbestos in it. In fact, simply working in a building that has some form of asbestos does not mean you are at risk. However, it is when the asbestos is exposed, so that you can inhale its fibers, you can be at risk for developing asbestos-related diseases. Thus, when your employer does not properly protect you from asbestos at your job or on a jobsite and you inhale it, this could result in a life-threatening disease. If you were exposed to asbestos on the job and are suffering from an asbestos-related injury, contact  Polsky, Shouldice & Rosen, P.C.  in order to schedule a consultation. Once we understand your circumstances, we will be able to advise you of all of your legal options accordingly. 
 Asbestos exposure: Construction Workers 
 Some of the highest-risk jobs that you can have when it comes to asbestos exposure involve working on the construction industry. Asbestos fibers are microscopic and are found in many items and tools that construction workers use on a regular basis, including floor tiles, ceiling tiles, pipes, insulation, and many other construction materials. While it is generally illegal for companies to use asbestos in their materials, a construction worker can be unknowingly exposed by renovating buildings, demoing buildings, and even conducting small repairs. It is therefore important to connect with a  Queens, New York on the job injury lawyer  as soon as you learn you have been exposed and/or harmed by this substance. Acting quickly can not only be beneficial medically, it can help you to protect your fellow workers from getting sick as well. 
 What kind of claim can a construction worker submit for asbestos-related illnesses? 
 When a construction worker is dealing with an asbestos-related illness that occurred because they were exposed on the job, they can file a legal claim with the assistance of a Queens on the job injury lawyer. In a personal injury case, there are three things that they must prove: 
 
 The defendant (perhaps the building owner or construction company) had the duty to protect the construction worker from the asbestos. 
 The defendant did not hold up their end of the deal and did not protect the construction worker. 
 Because of this breach of duty in care, the construction worker was harmed. 
 
 Examples of Breaches in Duty 
 A few examples of breaches in duty are: 
 
 Not monitoring the air quality properly. 
 Not providing construction workers with their own personal devices to monitor exposure. 
 Not using the appropriate ventilation systems to eliminate or reduce the asbestos. 
 
 Are there regulations regarding employee safety? 
 Yes. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has strict rules and regulations regarding the safety of employees, and this means that the employer is required to monitor the air quality in environments where there is likely to be asbestos. While asbestos is common and airborne (many people breathe in certain amounts of asbestos particles every day but not in dangerous quantities), the employer should successfully monitor a site to determine when it becomes dangerous. There are often many ways that a Queens on the job injury lawyer can hold negligent employers accountable for their behavior. 
 If you are a construction worker and you are suffering from an illness because your employer allowed you to be exposed to asbestos, please connect with a Queens on the job injury lawyer as soon as you can. Your legal options may become more limited over time, so it is important to act now.
