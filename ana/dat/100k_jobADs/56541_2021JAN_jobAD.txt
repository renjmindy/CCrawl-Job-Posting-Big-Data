 The simple way to search for property is built with Clojure and ClojureScript. 
 Role overview 
 We are looking for enthusiastic developers with a range of experience levels to join our expanding team. 
 We develop a popular public facing property website, in addition to several backend systems for stakeholders. 
 Youâ€™ll work closely with the product owners and stakeholders to deliver features efficiently  using scrum and kanban approaches.  We work in small developer lead teams and primarily develop in  Clojure . Weâ€™ll give you the opportunity to work on a range of projects giving you a broad understanding of our business and technical approaches. We believe firmly in using the right tool for the right job and youâ€™ll be involved in choosing them. 
 We work in a fast-paced environment with many production releases each week and pride ourselves in our applicationsâ€™ reliability. 
 All work is based in our London Waterloo office and we take pride in its friendly relaxed working atmosphere. 
 We have some interesting challenges on the horizon and are keen to hear from self-motivated individuals to create innovative yet pragmatic solutions. 
 All of our infrastructure is hosted on  AWS  and our current stack includes: 
 
 Clojure  &  ClojureScript 
 Elasticsearch 
 Postgres 
 Redis 
 HTML5 ,  CSS ,  Javascript 
 Many  AWS  services such as  SQS ,  Lambda ,  Kinesis SNS & S3 
 Highly available and scalable architecture 
 Test and deployment via  Jenkins 
 
 Experience in above technologies is not essential, youâ€™ll get to pair with some great staff to bring you up to speed where needed.
