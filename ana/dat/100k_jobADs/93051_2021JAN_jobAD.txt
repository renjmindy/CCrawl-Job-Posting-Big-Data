 Preparing to enter into a challenging job market in Melbourne. 
 Written by  Matthew Coppola - Career Coach, Employment Specialist and Professional CV Writer Posted on April 27, 2020 
 Melbourne's job market is definitely challenging without any question. You may be asking yourself what you can do to prepare to enter such a challenging workforce or make a career change in this kind of job market. 
 Look at what jobs are available now and will be available in the future. This will help you to understand the market and what roles you are wanting to apply for better. A great article to read on having your resume stand out is  What makes a good resume stand out? 
 So, the first step you need to take is getting your resume in order. A great idea is to have more than one CV that is tailored for different roles, this will help keep your options open and increase your chances. You can write a CV and cover letter yourself. Or seek assistance from a  professional resume and cover letter writer based in Melbourne  , who will create for you job application documents that work to highlight the best that you have to offer a prospective employer. 
 When job hunting for those suitable positions, you may find some roles require selection criteria to be addressed. Please do not overlook them! The application process for most Government roles includes selection criteria. You can address them yourself, or seek assistance from the  Melbourne selection criteria writers  at Client Centric Executive Employment Solutions. This Australian business has the expertise to write winning responses to any criterion, in any industry. 
 Reaching to the interview stage is challenging but definitely worth fighting to achieve. When you're in that interview sitting in front of the employer, you know they liked your application and have a high chance of securing the job, so this makes it so essential to get it right. An option you could do is enhance your interview technique by receiving interview coaching by an  experienced coach in Melbourne , who will guide and teach you to build up confidence.  Client Centric Executive Employment Solutions  offer this service, and from client reviews are very good at doing so. 
 Getting a job can take time, so never give up, stay in control and keep focused. A good article to read on what to do after the interview is  What should you do if you don't hear back from an employer after the interview?
