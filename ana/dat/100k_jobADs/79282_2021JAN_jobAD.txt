 Hi! I want to quickly set up a website for a real estate consultant company. I want something VERY simple (see example1).  This project shouldn't take longer than 6 hours (the example website my old guy did within 4 hours). 
 Pictures can be taken for google and the different tabs I want is only the following ones:

- About Us 
- Case study 
- Partners 
- Contact 
 
 Inspirational website

 Example1:  https://www.stratosphere-ltd.com/ 
Example2:  https://www.bain.com/industry-expertise/infrastructure-construction-building-products/real-estate/

 Develop a module that replaces the payment methods of the script 
 Published: Last month  Bids: 2 
 I need to develop a module to replace the payment methods of the script. 
 The script is coded in Ioncube so a parallel module must be developed that works with the script and uses my own payment methods: 
 1. Develop a module to use my own payment methods in the script 
 2. Make the module have the same script administrator login credentials even if they change. 
 3. The payment methods can be activated or deactivated / enter the corresponding payment method information in the module 
 4. We will start with the coinpayments payment method to receive bitcoin / ethereum or others supported by coinpayments and can add or remove coins. (It should be possible to add other payment processors later, once this part is completed, PerfectMoney, Payeer, Coinbase, Paykassa and others will be added) 
 
 The payment method must be integrated and shown in the script without leaving it. 
 
 6. When choosing a plan in the script and processing the payment, the balance must be automatically added to the user correctly 
 7. Automatic Withdrawals if the payment processor in this case coinpayments allows automatic withdrawals from the user's account in the script, it must be possible to activate or deactivate automatic withdrawals. 
 8. The user's account must be able to deposit with the account balance if available or make the deposit with my payment methods.
