 Career Breakthrough Coaching Programme 
 
 Go from "I don't know what I want" to "I know what I want and how to get it!" with my Career Breakthrough Programme. 
 The aim of my one-to-one Career Breakthrough Programme is to help you start off in the right direction on your journey to finding a career you love - a career that aligns with who you are, fulfills and motivates you, and fits around the family.  Working with me, you'll come away with clarity on your new career direction, a boost to your confidence and having discovered what you're good at and are truly passionate about. Plus, you'll have a concrete action plan outlining how to make your career change happen. 
 
 How does the programme work? 
 ​The programme takes you through my proven four-step model designed to develop the vision of what's next in your career and how you're going to unlock your potential and make this new vision a reality.​ 
 Step 1 - Reflect and clarify 
The first step in a strategic career change is to get to know yourself better. Here you'll discover what makes you tick, including the values that are most important to you, what motivates you at work, and your passions and interests. We'll also get clear on what you want (and don't want) from your new career, and what skills, strengths and expertise you have to offer. 
 Step 2 - Boost your confidence 
Next we'll look at building your confidence and overcoming any practical or emotional obstacles standing in your way. 
 Step 3 - Explore and research 
Here we will generate, explore and research new career directions - all the things you would love to do that fit with your values, passions, priorities, and lifestyle needs. 
 Step 4 - Make it happen 
And finally, we'll create your personalised Career Change Action Plan guaranteed to get you where you want to be in your life and career. The plan will act as a roadmap to your new career, and will include your career change goals, your research into the career options you'd like to consider further, a job search plan and what you will need to do to package and sell yourself with confidence. ​ 
 
 What does the programme include? 
 ​​ 
​The programme includes: 
 
 6 x 60 minute one-to-one coaching sessions held at your convenience over a period of 3-4 months. 
 Inter-session support as and when you need it. 
 In-depth preparatory material, worksheets and exercises tailored to you and your needs. 
 A follow-up call at the end of our sessions to review the progress you have made and discuss any support you need to implement your Career Change Action Plan. 
 
 ​Sessions are held in person in Berlin or Paris or over Skype. ​ 
 
 Who is the programme for? 
 ​The programme is particularly designed for you if you: 
 
 Are on maternity leave or an extended career break and re-assessing your career options. Do you want to change jobs or careers, start your own business, set up as a freelancer or go back to school? 
 Are in work but your current work situation is no longer a good fit and you would like to try something new. 
 You're not planning to work for a while, but would like to consider future options and make the most of your maternity leave / career break.
