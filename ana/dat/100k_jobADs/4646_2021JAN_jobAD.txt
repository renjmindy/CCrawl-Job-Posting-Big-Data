 Journalism and Communications Jobs 
 PLEASE NOTE THAT THE IRISH JOB FAIRY IS UNDERGOING A REVAMP HENCE WHY THERE ARE A LACK OF UPDATES 
 This category will highlight the latest journalism and communications roles in Ireland. 
 There will be a mixture of internships and full-time/part-time positions here but  I will not be posting positions from JobBridge nor unpaid internships  that don't offer at least expenses. 
 For some job listings there are no deadline dates specified, however I will be keeping an eye out to see when a job expires. If you find that the link is no longer valid, please inform me and I will take it down.
