 RIGHT TOOLS FOR THE JOB 
 By  razatoosy  on  August 17, 2014 
 SIMPLE CSV MAPPER. I had an evening yesterday to do some coding for another GP Surgery and it made me understand it’s not a matter doing the best possible application which is loosely coupled, well designed and future proof but using the right tools for the job. 
 I was asked by Tom Brownhill in a GP Surgery to see if they could do their flu invites though  PatientChase  (a product I develop which supplies software to GPs in the UK). Of course you can I said, but then he wanted the following 
 
 Individual Times for Each Patient 
 x number of  patients per slot 
 Slots of y minutes 
 within clinics of set times and dates 
 
 I set aside one evening to do the job but luckily when scoping out the app I soon realised to do it in an evening I’d need to do some rapid prototyping which is another word for shipping the app just to get the job done. But is that so bad? I would probably take a week if I was going to do it “properly” but this would be extra effort. So I’ve realised you need to do 
 
 The minimum amount of work to get the job done properly. 
 
 However it’s how you define the word properly which matters. 
 You can see the code in GitHub  here  in all it’s gory glory but a few comments 
 
 Why didn’t you use WPF? 
 
 It took me 5 minutes to do the front end and served the purpose it was meant to achieve. I think this is part of the problem with WPF, it can be difficult for developers to justify it’s use with it’s learning curve if they are just doing desktop vs desktop and other devices. It also has a high overhead especially for animations. 
 
 For loops, oh my! 
 
 This fitted well in the context of what I wanted to achieve. I’m not accessing the index so there’s no issue with out of index errors and it ’s little faster. 
 
 Using Datatables instead of Objects 
 
 There are lots of really nice csv helper nuget packages ( CsvHelper ,  FileHelpers ,  LINQToCSV ) out there but most of them require a one to one mapping with the columns and Models. I didn’t need this as I don’t care what’s right of the 1st column and if I did it would be more complex to define and inform the user. 
 I settled with  CsvReader  which converts the Csv to a Datatable from which I insert the Date and Time required for the patient into the 1st column. The only pre-requiste is that the first column must be named “Slot”. 
 Code to Load Csv Into the DataTable 
 Code to Save DataTable To File 
 Gosh, why use Datatables in this day and age. It was the right tool for the job and made the hard bit of the app so easy… 
 
 Passing GUI Controls Text Properties into the Service Layer 
 
 Again it’s not good practice to pass references to GUI controls directly to the service/domain layer. I should be abstracting this. However abstraction takes time and is there a need? 
 
 Lack of user error checking 
 
 This is one area I’d revisit quickly to tidy up input error checking and tidy up the GUI a bit to prevent exception errors for values in the wrong format and type. 
 In summary look at the user requirements, what you have at your disposal and time it would take to achieve your goal. Why do you want to create a ferrari when all the user needs is a bicycle to get from point A to point B?

 About Me 
 I’m a GP in the UK and know a bit of IT. I want to improve the way clinicians access and view data to make their lives easier. I’ve always been interested in IT and after qualifying as a GP I obtained a Masters Degree in IT with Distinction in 2007 which was a conversion course to be a professional IT developer. This has been invaluable in helping in developing applications for the primary care market. We have a product called  PatientChase  (2008) which looks at simplifying the patient recall process of GP practices and another one called  PatientLeaf  (2018) which is a real-time UX overlay for clinicians. 
 I also have a lovely wife and 2 beautiful children. This Blog is my thoughts on what I’m currently doing.
