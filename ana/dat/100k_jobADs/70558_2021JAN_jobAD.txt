 Gleeson Recruitment Group are exclusively working with a service provider in Burton to recruit a Senior Accountant to join their growing team. The organisation is Private Equity backed and has an aggressive investment plan which has already seen the company restructure its leadership team. With a new CFO and Financial Controller in place, the business is now looking for a practice trained Accountant who can really add value and wants to learn within a fast environment. 
 Due to significant Investment they are in a position to focus their time on reducing costs internally and rebuilding while the market is slow to ensure they are in the strongest position upon its return. The Senior Accountant is seen as essential to this change and is needed to add technical expertise and support with group consolidations, month end accounting and ensuring all statutory accounts are accurate. 
 This should appeal to Accountants who enjoy a varied workload, and want to be involved in a variety of projects, process improvements and being in an environment where your initial job description will likely change day by day, but even the smallest change that is made will be noticed and rewarded with continuous development. 
 The CFO & Financial Controller are ambitious and want someone who they can work alongside to really make a difference, and in return there will be not only be daily development, but also role changes that could see moves into FP&A or team management. 
 Package on offer is between £45,000 - £50,000 + Bens.
