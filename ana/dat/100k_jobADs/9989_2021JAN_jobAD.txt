 Ticket to Work 
 
 Social Security's Ticket to Work Program is a free and voluntary program available to people ages 18 through 64 who are blind or have a disability and who receive Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits. 
 The goals of the Ticket to Work Program are to: 
 
 Offer beneficiaries with disabilities expanded choices when seeking service and supports to enter, re-enter, and/or maintain employment; 
 Increase the financial independence and self-sufficiency of beneficiaries with disabilities; and 
 Reduce or, whenever possible, eliminate reliance on disability benefits. 
 
 Ticket to Work is a good fit for people who want to improve their earning potential and are committed to preparing for long-term success in the workplace. Ticket to Work offers beneficiaries with disabilities access to meaningful employment with the assistance of Ticket to Work employment service providers called employment networks. Work Services Corporation is the only Ticket to Work employment network in North Texas. 
 WSC can coordinate and provide appropriate services to help a beneficiary find and maintain employment. These services may include training, career counseling, vocational rehabilitation, job placement, and ongoing support services necessary to achieve a work goal.
