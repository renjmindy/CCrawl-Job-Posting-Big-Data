 About this project 
 finance-management / gather-data 
 USD 50 - 100 
 I am looking for realtor or person with access to the MLS in Roatan, Honduras - as I believe this is the only place where the reliable data can be extracted from. 
 I need a property investment report for buying land lots and houses in Roatan Island, Honduras. 
 Here is my suggestion for the report format, but if you can add additional value, please feel free to do that. 
For these categories: 
 
 Small land lots/parcels: less then 3000 m2 /0.72 acres; maximum allowed for foreign ownership 
 Larger land lots: 1 to 10 acres as land for potential subdivisions 
 Condos 
 Smaller single family homes: less then 150 m2 and 3 bedrooms 
 Larger single family homes: 150 - 300 m2 
 luxurious villas/mansions: larger then 300m2 
 
 For each category create a specific historical statistic of future projection: 
a) 10 (or 5 if 10 is not available) years of historical price data 
b) Price Impact of COVID situation in 2020 
c) expected price projection for next 5 years 
 Please add your overall market summary if you can. 
 Thank you, 
Ales
