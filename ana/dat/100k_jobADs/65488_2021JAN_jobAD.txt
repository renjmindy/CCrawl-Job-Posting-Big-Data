 Here, Humans will always come first. 
 We’re still working remotely, and we’ll do this until there’s a safe date to return to the office. For now, candidates can expect video interviews and, if you choose to join us, a fully remote orientation.

 We’ve continued to reimagine our employee programs, and we’re running virtual wellness classes, celebrations, company meetings, and launching new Employee Resource Groups. Our culture of positivity and gratitude is as bright as ever as we offer unmatched support for all our humans – in both their professional and personal lives. 
 Real stories from our humans 
 We're committed to creating human moments that matter for our employees. This means celebrating your successes and milestones in the office, and in your personal life.

 Benefits and perks for days 
 There are a lot of benefits to working human, but let’s start with the most meaningful. We value the whole human – not just what you bring to the office every day, but everything about you and who you are. Here, people are empowered to be themselves and do the best work of their lives. 
 Gratitudes® 
 We’re our own biggest customer. 
 We’re on a mission to make the workplace more human. This starts with how we reward and celebrate our own employees. We don’t just make Workhuman® Cloud for our customers, we live and breathe it. From life events like having a baby or buying your first home, to recognition and awards from colleagues, there’s a constant flow of positivity that lifts our entire organization. 
 Compensation 
 We value the whole human. 
 Here you can be yourself, learn, and grow with some of the best people you’ll ever meet. We offer a competitive compensation and benefits package that includes paid maternity and paternity leave, generous paid time off, and more, to support you (and your family) in all aspects of your life. 
 Balance 
 Work-life harmony is a thing here. 
 There are a lot of benefits when you Workhuman, but let’s start with the most meaningful – family, friendships, your health, and all the other responsibilities life throws your way. We get it. And we pride ourselves in offering a supportive and flexible environment so you can balance it all. 
 Workhuman® Gives 
 Giving back is in our DNA. 
 We have a lot to be grateful for here, and it’s important that we pay that feeling forward in our communities. Not only do we encourage employees to volunteer outside of work, but we also welcome them to bring the causes they care about most with them to Workhuman. We provide the support and means for employees to bring forward the volunteer opportunities, fundraisers, and sponsorship opportunities that they care about most. Bringing more humanity and kindness to everything we do is a huge part of who we are. 
 Workhuman® Innovation 
 Good ideas are better when shared. 
 Workhuman® Innovation is a biannual event to give our humans a voice around product enhancements. Since innovation is one of our core values, we encourage all employees to share their ideas and encourage different ways of thinking. Finalists present their concepts in front of the company and winners receive Gratitudes, an incredible trip, and the chance to see their idea come to fruition – pretty cool, huh? 
 Culture 
 We work hard together – and we celebrate together. 
 We know how hard our people work, so we like to celebrate – often. International Women’s Day, Bring Your Gratitude to Work Day, holiday celebrations, summer parties and Workhuman Thanksgiving (food coma), are just some of the ways we have fun at work. Love what you do and have fun while doing it. 
 Wellness 
 When we’re at our best, we do our best. 
 Self-care is key, and we’re on it. Enjoy a chair massage, refresh in one of our meditation rooms, join a yoga class, or grab a healthy snack in the Workhuman® café. Your health and well-being are a top priority for us – we want to support the whole human. 
 We aren’t the only ones who think our culture is great. 
 We’re proud of our award-winning culture. Why? Because it means we’re doing something right. We encourage our people to share their ideas and suggestions, and we act on them. It’s that simple, and crowdsourced recognition from outside parties such as Great Place to Work and The Boston Globe confirm we are on the right track.
