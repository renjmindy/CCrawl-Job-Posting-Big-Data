  3 Reasons Why Fall Is The Best Time To Look For A Job  
 Rebecca Karli 
 October 22, 2019 
 Have you ever heard the saying, "Timing is everything?" While job openings are advertised year-round, there are times of the year that are especially hot—and one of them is right now! 
 Here are three reasons why the fall season is the best time to find a job. 
 
 Employers Are More Motivated

 Fall is the season for change, so if you're looking for a career change, an opportunity for career growth, or a chance to promote your personal brand, now is the time to do it! 
 Not only that, it falls smack dab in the middle of two slow seasons—summer vacation and winter holiday—and for that reason,  it is a very productive time of year  for everyone. Hiring managers have just returned from summer vacation and are feeling particularly refreshed and motivated. They are no longer distracted by a warm, summer day outside their window. Instead, they are focused on filling positions before going home for the holidays or before their budget runs out at the end of the year. 
 This means that not only are there more jobs to apply for, but there is less wait time between the steps in the hiring process. In fact, according to  LinkedIn , 89% of hiring managers say that it typically takes them only four weeks to fill a role during this time. 
 And just for the record, in case you're wondering when is  the best day of the week and time of day to find a job  ,  a study conducted by SmartRecruiters  of 270,000 jobs over two years shows that it's  Tuesday at 11 am . This is important to know since it has been found that you have a greater chance of being noticed if you apply early. The longer you wait to apply for an opening, the more your application gets buried under the rest—so the sooner the better! 
 You'll Be Ahead Of The Competition

 Most people assume that the best time to look for a job is the beginning of the year because it's after the holidays and managers have brand new budgets and projects to start. However, this spike in available jobs can be offset by too much competition since everyone has the same idea. 
 Fall is considered  at least  the second-best time of year to find a job.  In fact, LinkedIn reports more job openings listed in October than during any other month and according to  Executives Online , an analysis of ten years of hiring data shows that October and November exceed the yearly average for the number of job postings. 
 Despite the promising numbers, fall tends to slip under people's radars. In addition, job-hunting tends to fall lower on many people's To-Do lists as they are more focused on Back to School activities, football games, and harvest and Halloween festivities; thus,  it's an opportune time for you to get a headstart on the competition . 
 
 It's A Good Time To Find Seasonal Jobs

 Even if you're not looking for your dream job or a permanent position, fall is a great time to find  seasonal work for the holiday and winter seasons . While the majority of seasonal jobs available will be in the fast-paced retail sector, you can also find positions in delivery and food services as people send more packages and families get together to eat. There are also more jobs in the tourism industry and holiday-specific jobs, such as Christmas tree harvesting and Santa Claus impersonating. There are also a lot of  work-at-home seasonal jobs  available, too. 
 Some of the  biggest-name companies  that will be hiring more than a combined 230,000 workers this season include  Amazon ($15/hr) ,  Target ($13/hr) , and  UPS ( $14-30/hr) . To attract more workers, these companies are offering higher wages and perks such as store discounts, and flexible hours. UPS is even offering tuition assistance. 
 Although most seasonal jobs are temporary, some companies may ask you to stay on after the holidays or hire you again in the future, so  it can be a good way to get your foot in the door . In any case, a seasonal job is a great way to make professional connections and gain the relevant skills you need to achieve your career goals and score your dream job. It's all about the long game! 
 If you're new to the job market, seasonal jobs will help you gain the hands-on work experience you need to discover your talents, hone your skills, and narrow down your choices for a future career. You can learn a lot about yourself while networking and making some extra cash at the same time! Who knows—you may even discover that working only during the busy seasons fits your lifestyle so that you have time to travel on the off-season! 
 A Word To The Wise

 Overall, in addition to good timing,  the best way to find your dream job is to do your homework . A lot of time can be wasted applying for jobs if you're not strategic and well-informed. It's important to note that there are many other factors that may influence the hiring process, such as the economy or industry-specific issues. A well-informed job seeker will know his or her target industry and what affects it. If you need more information,  consider checking out the Bureau of Labor Statistics  for industry-specific trends. 
 Moreover, whether you're applying for your dream job, a seasonal job or a side hustle, be sure to update your resume, tailor your cover letter, and research the company so that you're  prepared to ace that job interview .
