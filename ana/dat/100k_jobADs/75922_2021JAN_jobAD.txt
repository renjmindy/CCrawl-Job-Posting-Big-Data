 Glisser is the trusted platform for both the virtual event world of today and the hybrid event world of tomorrow. We're busy growing Glisser to be the leading platform that gives you best-in-class tools to create outstanding virtual and hybrid events that your audience will love. With Glisser you can bring people together, and create interactive and engaging experiences for 50 or 50,000 atteendes. We combine virtual and in-person attendance, and our unique audience engagement tools are both simple to use and secure to deploy. Our brand customization capabilities, data analytics and monetization solutions help you turn your event into a success. We are headquartered in London, with a strong presence in the US. 
 The Role 
 To accelerate our revenue growth, Glisser is seeking a Business Development Manager to join our growing team of fun, driven and successful sales professionals. This role is important to Glisser as we fuel our ambitious expansion plans, and is a perfect stepping-stone for someone determined to take the next step and grow as a sales professional. 
 Key Responsibilities 
 
 Deliver an annual revenue quota 
 Execute on strategic account plans for your customers 
 Support commercial negotiations and closures, growing to assume more and more responsibility yourself 
 Take full ownership of tracking account engagement, growth metrics and keeping our CRM system up to date 
 Work with the SDR team to maximise value of our leads 
 Become a Glisser platform champion and perform customer demonstrations effortlessly 
 Be an ambassador for the Glisser promise, values and vision 
 
 Who you are 
 We're looking for an ambitious person with a couple of years of sales experience in the bag. You've already worked in Enterprise and SaaS sales, but want to go deeper. Perhaps you are a high-performing SDR who wants to move up a notch? You understand the importance of prioritising and building relationships across all levels and departments. You have at least two years of experience in a similar role, at a fast-paced start-up, and are used to rolling your sleeves up and getting stuff done as part of a high-performing team. 
 You are self-driven, passionate, personable and curious. A strong communicator! Since we are a rapidly growing team, you are proactive and helpful, and you thrive in helping the team to succeed. You obviously are a self-starter and a problem-solver. Although we have an office, we expect you to be comfortable as a remote contributor. It would be great but not necessary for you to have previous experience of selling in the event organising market. 
 Package & Perks 
 We offer a competitive salary, an excellent commission package and a good slug of share options at a company valuation that allows you to get into an ambitious scale-up in a red-hot market at an early stage. 
 You'll get a laptop and relevant home equipment necessary to get the job done. And we don't micro-manage. We are a trusting but supportive team that just delivers. 
 Everyone around you works hard, getting our hands dirty, and giving you the freedom to contribute to many different areas of the business. We're really just shaping the company culture, so your personality will help determine the place that you work. 
 We promise, above all, to be nice people to work with.
