 Hello. 
 We're _SocialStarters. We bring good businesses and people together to create change. 
 We believe that purpose-driven business growth is the sustainable future, collaboratively powered by those around them. Let's draw on each other's strengths and catalyse growth. 
 We're in our 6th year, and we've been through a period of structural change. We're regrouping, redesigning, and recruiting amazing people in order to take us forward in 2021. As a result, we're looking for a brilliant professional to join our team and steer the ship from 2021 and beyond. 
 You'll have a passion for people, startups, impact, marketing, sales, learning and making things better! 
 - Do you have 10+ years' experience in the private, public or charity sector? 
 - Have you grown businesses from £100k turnover to up to £1m? 
 - Are you multi-skilled and ready to lead a brilliant team? 
 - Are you experienced in high consideration purchase businesses? 
 - Do you know about building sales funnels and customer journeys? 
 - Do you geek out when it comes to metrics? 
 We are looking for a self-starter, someone who can manage their own time and priorities, working on your own initiative and as part of a remote team? 
 This is a fantastic opportunity for someone who is transitioning from a corporate role and looking to move into the impact sector - that is in fact what we are all about! If you are looking for an opportunity to work in the social impact and purpose-driven or start-up space and make a real difference, and you are ready to invest in that transition, with potential for share options later down the line and a generous annual performance-related bonus then this role is for you. 
 Because we're a small organisation, you'll get to experience the full 360 of a small business, but that means this is a highly implementational role where you can really implement change. 
 Application process: please upload your CV and cover letter. Applications without cover letters explaining very clearly and concisely (500 words max) what you know about social enterprise, small business consulting, scaling ventures, and managing teams, won't be considered. Interviews will be taking place throughout December and January. 
 Application deadline - rolling until we find the right person. 
 Start date - ASAP.
