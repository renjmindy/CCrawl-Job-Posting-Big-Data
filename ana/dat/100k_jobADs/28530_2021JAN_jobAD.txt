 The NSW Government deserves full credit for seeking to protect jobs and secure NSW electricity supply by ensuring the ongoing operation of the Springvale Mine near Lithgow. 
 "Springvale is the sole provider of coal to the Mount Piper Power Station which provides around 11% of our State's electricity, however a flaw in the planning system allowed an activist group to mount a legal challenge that threatened the mine's continued operation," NSW Minerals Council CEO, Stephen Galilee said. 
 "The NSW Government has made a responsible decision to introduce legislation that will maintain water quality in the Sydney Catchment, and at the same time allow the Springvale mine to keep Mount Piper supplied with coal." 
 "Protecting the supply of affordable and reliable electricity to families and businesses across NSW is a fundamental responsibility of any government, and the NSW Government should be congratulated for doing so," Mr Galilee said. 
 "There are around 600 families in the Lithgow region who rely on the Springvale Mine and the Mount Piper Power Station for their livelihood. The NSW Government's planned legislation will secure these jobs for the future." 
 "The NSW Government's action will also protect the jobs of many thousands more that work in businesses across the state that rely on electricity from the Mt Piper Power Station." 
 "We urge the Parliament to support the NSW Government's actions to protect jobs and and keep the lights on in NSW," he said.
