 8/5/2019

 Greetings! 
 Secure your spot AND mark your calendar for these fun, educational, and deliciously entertaining networking opportunities THIS summer! 
 **The PAYDAY game networking night was a blast! The person with the most money in the end wins (I had won the game with $32,500 cash, Peter was second place with a figure in the $27,000 range and Robert placed third with $24,000 range of cash on hand). The sushi or chicken teriyaki game night was also a blast! I had won the 4 games we played of "Befuddled" (word game similar to Scrabble), so rest assured I am good with words. I did win my third grade spelling bee! :)

 There's still 2 spots available for the Scopa National Italian card game and homemade Tacoma Boys pizza night that takes place NEXT Tuesday evening (NOT tomorrow Tuesday), below so be sure to secure your ticket(s) BY THIS FRIDAY BY 12 (noon) for the early bird rate. 3+ spots still available for the Odd Jobs networking game night (which you can see was a hit last summer, first picture of attendees in the first picture of this blog posting). 
 EVENT #1:   Have an Italian evening complete with the traditional Italian card game "Scopa" as well as   eat one of the best homemade, fresh, and best tasting pizzas LOCALLY from Tacoma Boys in Puyallup. The sauce is homemade and the pizza will have double pepperoni on it & tastes like nothing from the local pizza chains and isn't greasy either! 
"Scopa" is the National Card game of Italy that everyone can enjoy. Lively and colorful Scopa cards make for a fun & fast paced game where skill and chance rule, while the specially designed scoring boards makes score keeping easy. For up to 4 players. 
 Join me & other business owners, career seekers, business professionals, & practically anyone else, except kids on Tuesday, August 13, 2019 from 6 pm to 8 pm in the upstairs room of the Daffodil Bowling alley located at: 1624 E. Main Street, Puyallup, WA 98372 .  We will start promptly at 6 pm where I will introduce myself, one minute intros of the attendees will take place, the opportunity to pass out business cards and flyers, and then we will dive right into the game, eat pizza, pack up, and be out no later than 8 pm. There is another event (NOT mine) in the room we will be in at 8 pm, so PLEASE do know we will be out NO later than 8 pm so please plan accordingly (be on time and take your chatting elsewhere outside of the room). IF YOU ARE SICK OF ANY KIND, please do NOT come to the event (regardless if you think it's a minor cold, flu, etc). I repeat it's no joking matter you can spread symptoms to others that are way worse, please stay home. 
 Admission to this Italian themed night, pizza, game playing, networking, and hourly room rental, is $47.47 a person ($45.50 a person with non-card option) $47.47 includes debit/credit card processing fees that I don't benefit from. Again you'd click the "Buy Now" purple button AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS NEWSLETTER LINK:  https://conta.cc/31iHVkJ   **& pay with a credit card or debit card and I do NOT see your card information. * If you want to make other arrangements to make the payment via cash, check, or money order, you'd have to mail to: Carly Calabrese 18807 97th Avenue Court East Puyallup, WA 98375 and checks can be made out to: "Carly Calabrese" as well the amount would be $45.50 with no debit/credit card processing fees and the same terms and conditions would apply if purchasing this way. PLEASE ALLOW FOR UP TO 3 BUSINESS DAYS FOR SNAIL MAIL EVEN IF IN THE SAME CITY/STATE AND PAYMENT WOULD HAVE TO ARRIVE BY THE FRIDAY, AUGUST 9TH DATE AS WELL VIA SNAIL MAIL. 
 If you do NOT prepay to secure your spot by Friday, August 9, 2019 by 12 (noon) PST (Pacific Standard Time) you will pay the $52.15 per person option regardless of NOT having food for you AND regardless if you pay cash as that's the price for NOT making a commitment. :) No refunds under any circumstances (feel free to send someone in your spot if you can't make it, but if you can't find someone there are still no refunds). NO discounts of any kind even if you/your person who comes in your place is late. 
 **EVENT #2: Calling all job seekers, career changers, business owners, & practically anyone else, except kids, to play the hilarious game of "Odd Jobs Help Wanted: Apply Within" Practice marketing yourself for up to 200 business cards and 180 jobs to convince the client (the people playing with you) to hire YOU for the job. Game is for 4 or more players. ** 
 Admission to this fun, educational, game to play which allows you to utilize and practice your marketing/selling skills useful in all career fields, and networking (with the opportunity to do your one minute commercial, pass out business cards & flyers), along with the hourly room rental, is $44.87 per person ($43 a person non-card rate) the $44.87 rate is with credit card/debit card processing fees I don't benefit from. Again you'd click the "Buy Now" purple button at THE BOTTOM OF THIS NEWSLETTER LINK:  https://conta.cc/31iHVkJ 
 IF YOU ARE SICK OF ANY KIND, please do NOT come to the event (regardless if you think it's a minor cold, flu, etc). I repeat it's no joking matter you can spread symptoms to others that are way worse, please stay home.
