 Why Working Wider? 
 Value creation has moved from the center of the firm to its edge and beyond. People are working and collaborating beyond home base to create value, including outside their firm. I call this phenomena "Working Wider". It dramatically changes the world of work, what defines leadership, how you compete and win. 
 We’re not just being challenged to think outside the box -- Now we’re working outside it as well. 
 I'm Christopher Meyer - author of  Fast Cycle Time, Relentless Growth  and several Harvard Business Review articles.
