 **Apple a Day Original Acrylic Painting NFS 
 ** 
 Prints on Paper, Canvas, Metal, Greeting Cards, pillows, !phone and galaxy phone cases Available at KENDALL KESSLER ART 
 Apple a Day is another sensuous, colorful painting from my series, 
 Suggestions. I am starting with an abstract expressionist surface and then looking for forms that appear in the paint. This time an apple shape began to appear so I made it into a very lively still life. I am especially pleased with the brushwork in this one.

 Life with the Word and Bird Man - Clyde Kessler 
 I love all the arts and if I had a bunch of lives I would seriously pursue every one of them! I live to paint but I also play the piano and line dance. 
 I have the greatest respect for artists and I hate it when people won 't hire an artist when they need one. I am talking about commercials that have the people that are advertising act out skits to sell. That really gets on my nerves. I can't get to the mute button fast enough. 
 Locally,  there are two businessmen that put on skits on commercials that are horrible! They make me appreciate actors and all they go through to master their craft. 
 They are so bad that I honestly think I could do a better job and I have never had an acting lesson. 
 Clyde says two squirrels from out back yard could audition for the commercial and do better even if they were hired to play themselves.
