 Class 1-2 Trucks Get the Job Done in 2021 
 October 12, 2020  • by  Lauren Fletcher 
 Focusing on trucks utilized by vocational truck fleets, Work Truck rounded up what's available in the under 10,000-pound gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR)  Class 1-2 category for the 2021  calendar-year. 
 Every year , Work Truck editors dig in to find out what's new, what's the latest, and what's the greatest. Vehicles were placed in a truck class based on the lowest available GVWR and information is based on the latest information provided by the OEMs. Additionally, specifications will vary greatly depending on how the truck is spec'ed.
