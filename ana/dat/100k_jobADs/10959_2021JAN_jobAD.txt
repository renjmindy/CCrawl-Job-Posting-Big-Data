 The Network Security Planning (NSP) team is seeking a Security Automation Planner to plan the requirements, architectures, and roadmaps for automating security controls/capabilities that will protect Verizon’s networks. These capabilities might include OpenSCAP to automate configuration aspects of servers, Ansible scripts to automate how a program integrates with a centralized access control service, or self-service portals where programs can trigger automated vulnerability scanning. The Planner will also support architecture and roadmap development for Verizon’s key systems such as its 4G/5G networks, intelligent Edge Network (iEN), IoT networks and devices, and big data/cloud by ensuring his/her plans for automated capabilities support and protect those systems. The SME will also work with academic and research institutions to identify and mitigate long-term security threats affecting data protection. 
 As a member of the NSP team, you will work in a fast-paced environment focused on planning and managing security risk for Verizon’s most critical systems. You will interact with the engineers building and operating key systems, security engineering and operations teams, and the Verizon CISO organization to ensure the team’s recommendations address operational considerations. You will ensure the team collaborates with vendors and the broader security community to stay up to speed on the latest security developments and ensure their future capabilities align with Verizon’s needs.

 Execute RFIs/RFPs when it is time to reevaluate vendors and select the winning vendor. 
 Document the security automation capabilities and deployments in artifacts such as high-level designs (HLDs) and low-level designs (LLDs). 
 Shepherd deployments of security automation capabilities through the Network Implementation process. 
 Collect feedback from stakeholders and users of the capabilities and incorporate that feedback into the roadmap so the service continually improves. Create metrics/KPIs to show how the service is improving security over time. 
 Support development of security architectures, roadmaps, and requirements for key Verizon systems by documenting how network sensors will support and protect them. 
 Build relationships with program, engineering, operations, security, and CISO teams to understand how to develop plans that effectively manage Verizon’s security risks. 
 Communicate progress, findings, and ensure successful handoff of deliverables to program and operational teams. 
 Build domain knowledge of Verizon’s environment to understand long-term risk areas that will develop as the systems evolve. 
 Provide thought leadership by participating in network and security forums and collaborating with academic and research institutions.
