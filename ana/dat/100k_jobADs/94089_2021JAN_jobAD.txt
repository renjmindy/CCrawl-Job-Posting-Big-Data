 About this project 
 writing-translation / article-writing-1 
 Less than USD 50 
 You MUST write in English Fluently 
Please read the ENTIRE description 
I can pay with 15 dollars USD per script, this can be regular work 
 What I need: 
2 to 4 scripts with a minimum of 1,500 words written on a weekly basis. 
The scripts will be in list form with no introduction, and have a minimum of 10 items 
 I will provide: 
The subject and possibly some research help (depending on the subject) 
 The subjects will be: 
Technology, for example: "Top 10 greatest Robots" or "10 Greatest cars ever" 
History, for example: "15 Things you didn't know about ancient Egypt" 
Conspiracies, for example: "10 ways we know aliens have visited" 
 If you feel capable of writing about one of these subjects I would be glad to have you try out. 
 I expect all writers to be about 90% fluent in English. 
The content should be clever and even a bit funny at times. 
 If you are interested I ask that you write me 200 words about either of the subjects below, you message it to me on Workana 
- 2 things most people don't know about Ancient Greeks 
or 
- 2 robots that are really cool 
 This is simply a test of your English and writing ability. 
I can pay with 15 dollars USD per script. 
 I believe in a good work relationship with good communication. 
 Feel free to message me with questions. 
Thanks!
