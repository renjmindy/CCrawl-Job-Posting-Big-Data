  This Theory Of Awesomeness Leads To Your Dream Job  
 Ryan Niessen 
 April 24, 2014 
 Are you tired of living a mediocre life? Do you know that you’re capable of doing more, but not 100% sure what that is and how to get there? Maybe you’re comfortable with your job, and feel like you should be happy with what you have… After all, other people you know seem happy there.  Related:   Getting Your Dream Job: What You Can Learn From Harry Potter  Well, I have good news for you. You’re not the only one feeling that way, and you are capable of more. You just need to apply… 
 
 “The Theory of Awesomeness” 
 I’ll explain this awesome theory in a moment. First, here’s a  beautiful infographic  breaking it down nicely - check it out, then come back and read on. In this article, I’m going to show you how to use “The Theory of Awesomeness” to get your dream job. I’ll tell you where to find the best companies in the world to work for, and how to get their attention. Now, the man who created “The Theory of Awesomeness” is actually the CEO and founder of one of the most “awesome” companies out there (shocking… I know). And he uses it to lead his fun, inspiring team of people from around the world as they make a difference as well as profit… and have a whole lot of fun doing it.  His company, Mindvalley, is part of a new list called the GameChangers 500. This is your first tip - because that list is exactly where you’ll want to start your search for your dream job. See, companies on the GameChangers 500 list have similar values to Mindvalley - like having fun in the workplace, making happiness a priority, and working on projects that impact the world. (They even have an annual team retreat to a remote, exotic island for a few days.) So, let’s dive deeper on this. Here’s... 
 “The Theory of Awesomeness” In a Nutshell 
 It’s all about being in Flow. This isn’t some woo-woo crazy idea; it’s actually the title of a famous book by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (don’t even try to pronounce his name) called  Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.  It’s a positive state where you can discover true happiness and greatly improve the quality of your life - potentially achieving things you never thought possible. (And no, you don’t have to be a Jedi to do so.) In fact, think of it being like Bradley Cooper in the movie  Limitless . He takes a pill and becomes perfectly clear. All of the answers appear, and he can achieve things he never thought possible, effortlessly. Now, getting into Flow without the magic pill from  Limitless  basically comes down to two things: 
 1. Being Happy in the Now 
 Practices like meditation, inspirational reading, and starting your day by thinking of a few things you’re grateful for have been proven to increase your happiness and get you into Flow. Because the truth is, no matter how bad your current situation is, focusing on how terrible it is won’t get you out of it. However, increasing your happiness right now gives you the energy to envision and pursue a better future, and it frees your mind from the paralyzing negative mental clutter unhappiness creates. 
 2. Having an Awesome Vision of the Future 
 Set unrealistic goals based on the things you really want in life - like following your passion, contributing, exploring, and being genuinely happy. Don’t hold back. And when you’re looking for your dream job - don’t just scan Craiglist and pick the best one in your area. Spend some time creating an awesome, inspiring vision of your future that makes you excited to get up and take the next step closer to it. Find a company that inspires you - like those on the GameChangers 500 list - get in Flow, and use that energy to get their attention in a unique way.  Hint: Don’t use a traditional resume and cover letter.  At the very least - put them online. At best, create a YouTube video, a website or blog, or do something wild and creative like send a hot air balloon to them with a proposal inside (like one guy did to get Richard Branson’s attention). Then look out, world. You’re going to do something awesome. And if you’d like some help getting your dream job with an awesome company like this, check out the  free video  I put together with the founder of the GameChangers 500 list. In it, I share his best tips for getting your  dream job  with an awesome, GameChanging company.
