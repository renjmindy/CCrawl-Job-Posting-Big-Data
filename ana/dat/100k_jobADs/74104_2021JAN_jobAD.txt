 Good Vibes Today 
 Kids play. It’s something we often seem to have forgotten how to do. Playing is a way to express yourself, be active, and of course have fun. Kids have it right. Where did we go so wrong? Whatever your kids are playing today… join in. Don’t change it up. Don’t try to “create” the scene. Just join in to the adventure they are living in the moment. #dad #daddy #daddys #dadlife #dadliferules #daddydaughtertime #instadad #instadaddy #dadsofinstagram #parenting #parentingquotes #momlife #moms #momsofinstagram #mom 
 Find something your kids really want to do today. Then… do that. Uninterrupted. Totally present. No phones. No nothing except whatever they want to do. If they say, “I dunno. It doesn’t matter to me.” Then here are some suggestions: • play monopoly • play hide n seek • play Marco Polo in the water • play a video game • play a prank on someone (no flaming bags on porches) Having fun with each other strengthens bonds. #bestrong #dad #dadlife #dadliferules #dads #instadad #instadaddy #parenting #parentinghacks #parentfail 
 Our kids idolize us. Like a mark on a tree they carry what we teach them into the future. Past where we can go. Beyond what we can dream. Feed imagination. Nurture curiosity. Search for moments. #dadlife #instadad #dadding #dads #dad #daddy #parentingtips #parenting #butdad #meetthemckinneys #instadads
