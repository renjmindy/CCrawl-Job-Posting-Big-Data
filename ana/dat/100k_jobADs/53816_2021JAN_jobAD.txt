 RVer Job Opportunity 
 New Work Camper (rare!) opportunity just received for the Texas Hill Country! 
 December 13, 2018December 21, 2018  |  Snowbird RV Trails 
 NOTE: This Work Camper position has been filled. Do not apply. 
 Couple wanted to live free at my beautiful, historical, ranch in Texas, for doing small jobs. 
 (Sent to me, Jack, 12/13/18) 
My wife Heidi and I own a small 'Not for Profit, just for Enjoyment' Game Ranch, where there is no boring office duties, no 'running credit cards' or checking RV'rs in and out, no swimming pools or restrooms to clean, just mainly 'grunt work', but Nothing Hard………. 
 The Following will give you a better idea of what I need done on here. 
 Again, Thanks, 
 B.J. and Heidi McCord, Kerrville, Texas 
 What I expect in my Workamper Couple: 
 I prefer an Honest, Permanent Couple (for two sets of eyes), to be with us for a good length of time, and, we prefer 'Home-Bodies', rather than those that 'Have to Travel' all the time, so someone will be here in case something happens & we need you. 
 Summer 'DayTrips' and even 'weekenders' are fine as long as the 'Duties are Done', but longer than that is 'stretching it'. Winter is Much more 'open' for you to travel because there is less we can do on here as the deer are 'in Rut' (breeding), then having babies, etc., so we stay Out of the pastures. 
 I will not have Children or un-trained Yapping Dogs', because I Will Not have Anything chasing or bothering our chickens, game, and/or other wildlife that live here. NO Pit Bulldogs, No loud Music, No loud vehicles, or loud people, or Anything Else Loud. 
 On the small engine repairs, I just need someone who is capable of deciphering problems and get our lawnmowers, chainsaws, or weed-eaters, mowing and bucket tractors running if they fail to, or to be able to 'tune them up' if they don't run right, and maintain them, rather than having to take them to a durn shop to be fixed. We don’t use them very often, but when we do, we need 'em to run right. 
 As far as a Carpenter goes, I need a 'half-az' carpenter to replace the top deck bannister and floor, and paint on our old home, and possibly give the CampHouse a good coat of Wood Sealer, maybe replace a screen door, etc., etc., etc. 
 I don't offer any pay, but just a spacious RV spot in a Live Oak Tree Mott, and I furnish along with the site, electricity, septic, water, and satellite TV. 
 If the Wifi I have in the house will work, you will have it also, if not we can talk about getting it in. 
 I need some ‘ranch work’ done, and a few carpentry ‘re-builds’ on our 122 year old home and possibly some painting here and there, but the 'work' is Not limited to this. I have a list of the work, pretty well in the order of 'Has to be done No, to Later'…… 
 The Axis & White-Tail deer and other animals and birds that call this place 'Home', are so comfortable on here, they eat, sleep, breed, and bare their young on here, so we don’t even go into some areas, because it may disturb them and they may move. I will show you the areas to ‘Stay Out Of’. 
 You will need to keep us a supply ready of 'mixed up' 'Hi-Protein' Feed, in 5-gallon buckets, for us to feed our deer with (as my wife Heidi feeds every afternoon), feed and care for our chickens, gather their GREAT eggs for you and I, keep our 'Live Traps' baited 24/7 to catch and 'dispatch' the predators that kill or chase our defenseless feathered friends, rabbits, and/or deer, then feed them to our poor buzzards at our ‘bone yard’. 
 You will be expected to pick up any trash that may blow onto our fence off the highway, help plant Oats for our deer, mow, 
 weed-eat and grub weeds in the summertime, pull dead trees to the 'burn pile', and be able to fix any problem that arises with the mower or weed-eater engines, and then 'Winterize' by wrapping and insulating a few water pipes & water items to keep them from freezing in the winter times, ‘ride’ the West fence and look good for ‘Crawl Holes’ at least weekly & if found ‘Rock Them Closed’, in order to keep Foxes, Bobcats, Raccoons, Hogs, Porcupines, and ‘feral dogs’, etc. Out. 
 You can ‘Shock’ our pool, clean water filters on our fish tanks, and many other ‘odd things’ that may come up, like trim cedars to widen roads, _ but be sure to poison any Fire Ant mounds whenever and wherever you see them_. 
 If you get bored, you can ‘straighten’ the items in the barn, make sure all vehicle tires are up so they don’t go flat & ruin. 
 I would like to say I want about 22 hours a week, but after you get 'the Duties lined out', I really and truly don’t believe this would take over 12 to 15 hours a week to do. If you see it is taking longer, heck, wait till the next week. There’s No Rush on here! 
 Remember to NEVER WALK On This Ranch, Away From the Barn-House Areas! Always drive our old Kawasaki Mules, as the game is used to them, as feed comes out of them, but Please Drive Them Slowly, so it doesn’t hurt them, OR scare our game. NEVER leave the House/and/or Barn areas at night, other than by the main road to the main gate. Please Fuel the Mules up and check the tires for air, weekly. 
 While doing all of this, Always Being Aware of Trespassers, or people who are on this Ranch, Uninvited, and be ready to call the 
 Sheriff if Anyone is ever seen, _ which it never has, but …in this idiotic day in time, ya never know………._. 
 Other than that, just sit, relax, and enjoy the Beauty of this ‘Historical old Ranch, and this Portion of the Texas Hill Country’, and 
 all of the many species of wildlife, that call this place,’ Home’. 
 If you need to have a job, there is no reason why you can't get a job in town and still do the few jobs I need done here, also. 
 This place is Not 'Work, Work, Work', it is more like 'Work a little then relax & enjoy, work a little then Relax & enjoy'. There is NO hard work here, and Nothing that I don't already do myself at 78. Well, other than fix gas motors & replace flooring……..Ha! 
 Please Understand, this is a ‘Low-Fenced but ‘High Quality Game Ranch’, and in order to keep it as quiet as possible on here & to keep from disturbing our many ‘Game Animals’, that Live Here, we cannot allow you to have guest over here. We just cannot 
 have people ‘coming and going’, all times of the day and night. So, Please meet and visit with your guest in town, and not here. 
 _ Now, This Is Not Written in Stone  , we are willing to listen if you want someone _ that is Quiet  to stay overnight or even a weekend, and if you want to travel in the summer, we can work out a schedule when y'all and We want to travel, and the other can be here, watching and taking care of our place, and our animals, birds, and fish for us. 
 Kerrville and this surrounding area of the Beautiful ‘Texas Hill Country’, has many, many beautiful, and historical, areas to visit & 
 enjoy, and we own a kayak that you are Most Welcome to borrow, if you want to ‘Float’ the Beautiful Guadalupe, Frio, or Sabinal 
 Rivers’ to relax, swim, or fish. Just be sure to take paddles, ‘life jackets’ & if you fish, have current Fishing Licenses, to be ‘legal’. 
 When we ‘travel’ in our RV in the summertime, you will be expected to still get the trash out & pick up our mail, feed our deer, fish, 
 chickens and song birds, and make sure all of the sources of water are working for them to drink fresh, clear, water, and have everything they need to keep them happy & Extra safe on here, so they will be here when we get back. 
 There's Many other things that need to be done that I cannot possibly put down here. Just keep our place like you would if you owned it and loved the animals as much as we do. 
 Please Understand: You are an Independent Contractor, so we Do Not collect any taxes out of paychecks for the government. 
 Again, we prefer 'Home-Bodies', that are happy staying here, rather than those that 'Have the Need to Travel' all the time. 
 I have a 'write-up' of the History of Kerr County and of the particular ranch that I own, that I will be more than happy to share with you. Just ask me for them. 
 FYI: We believe that Donald Trump is doing a Great Job! If you disagree, please do yourself a huge favor and learn the truth about Trump rather than believe all of the Democratic lies, which as far as I can see, lies are the only thing Democrats Excel at. 
 After reading this, I would like to hear from you. 
 Please email me ONLY, at  mccord11@windstream.net 
 Thanks, 
 B.J.
