 September 19, 2009 
  9/16/09 @ Wrigley Field  
 Over a week without attending a game…hotdamn I was anxious for this one. 
As you may or may not know, entering this game, I needed to snag only 6 baseballs to reach the 1000 baseball plateau.  I wanted to do it at Wrigley-the birthplace of the ballhawk. 
 The day started with a train ride to Chicago. 
 A young man by the name of Kenny was attending the game with me.  I met Kenny back in 1997 at Milwaukee County Stadium.  At the time, he was a shy 13 yr. old kid, who seemingly, went to every game.  He always sat in the bleachers and  always  brought his glove.  Kenny only missed a handful of games over a 3 yr. period back in the late 90's…incredible, to say the least. 
 Kenny and I arrived at Wrigley Field early so we could catch a few of the Brewers coming into the stadium.  Wrigley Field is awesome for autographs because the majority of the players have to walk right past you to get into the stadium. 
 Here's where we were waiting… 
 
…on the corner of Addison & Sheffield outside GATE D. 
 Here's what we were waiting for… 
 
…taxi cabs containing baseball players. 
 Here's a picture of the aforementioned Ballhawk Kenny waiting for the next cab to pull up while standing next to the drunk guy statue (with creepy little heads popping out of his legs)… 
 
 …Kenny's a pretty decent ballhawk.  With 12 career game home runs snagged, he can hold his own with the best of us…no doubt. 
 Finally, someone arrived… 
 
…Someone with a capital "S." 
 All-time saves leader Trevor Hoffman had us line up along that green railing. 
 After a minute wait… 
 
…I added his autograph to my 2009 Milwaukee Brewers team signed baseball. 
 Shortly thereafter, Brewers top prospect Mat Gamel stopped to sign autographs… 
 
 …among other Brewers players. 
 While we were waiting for players, this creepy advertisement rolled by… 
 
 …what in the hell is that?? 
 Then, I noticed this cute little sign by Harry Caray's Tavern… 
 
…piss-off, Chicago. 
 After a few more autographs, we saved our spot in line and played a little "catch." 
Eventually, the gates would open and we were perched in the bleachers (we had regular bleacher seats, not the bleacher box-so, we were restricted to the bleachers only). 
 My 1st ball on the day was an overthrow from an uknown Cubs pitcher.  He was aiming for someone else and sailed it.  I ran about 20 feet to my left and picked it up on the bounce.  Immediately, all of the classy Cubs fans began to yell and shout to "give it away to a kid!" 
I could not find any young Brewers fans nearby, so, I left the area. 
 While standing in left-center, I saw a different Cubs pitcher aim for a fan.  This time, I was closer to the intended target.  Like the previous overthrow, this one sailed, too.  But, unlike the previous, I was in position to run about 10 feet to my left and make the catch. 
Sorry Cubs fans…better luck next time. 
 Finally, the Cubs left the field and allowed a real team to take BP (the Cubs players only hit a couple baseballs into the bleachers in the 1st 30 minutes). 
 When it was Prince Fielder's turn, I headed over to right field.  I had been watching him all season long.  I feel like I know his tendencies. 
 I was right. 
 My 3rd ball on the day came on the fly off the bat of Prince Field 
er.  I had him played perfectly.  I only had to move up a couple rows and a few feet over to make the grab. 
 Fielder would hit one more to me before he was through.  That one was snagged on the bounce and immediately given to a little girl dressed in pink sitting with her parents (having a daughter of my own-I'm a softie for girls in pink). 
 BP ended without any further baseballs. 
The wind was blowing in intensely… 
 
 …as you can see by the flags. 
 When the game got started, I noticed a few things… 
 
 …typical Wrigley Field alcohol abuse.  (that's like $5 in beer spilled on the ground) 
 
 …do all Cubs fans have that stupid look on their faces? 
 I digress. 
 Pictures of the basket… 
 
 
 …the basket rules. 
 The glove I used on this day… 
 
 …my Brother Jon's mitt.  It was his birthday on this day.  I thought it would bring me luck. 
 **Does anyone recognize the autograph on the mitt?   If you do, I'll be shocked. 
I'll give you a hint…former Brewers 3B. 
 **Today's snags… **

 …four (4) total with two (2) shown. 
 One was given away to a small girl and an additional baseball was given to the usher in our aisle.  He was extremely friendly to us which made the game that much more enjoyable.
