 Parked on the dole: Closing Job Centres and handing responsibility for finding work to private companies would condemn thousands - if not hundreds of thousands - of people to a life on benefits (if they don't get sanctioned and starve). 
 It 's incredible that allies of George Osborne are backing proposals to shut down all Job Centres and let private companies fill the void. 
 The proposal to let the private sector find work for Britain's unemployed is actually being considered for inclusion in the Conservative Party's election manifesto for 2015,  according to the  Huffington Post . 
 It quotes a 'senior Tory' who told  The Sun  : "Introducing competition into the job search market is a natural Conservative thing to do." 
 This means Conservatives are naturally unimaginative, if not altogether stupid. 
 Have they already forgotten the lessons learnt from the way work programme provider companies treated jobseekers that were sent their way -  as  Vox Political  reported last year ? 
 The process is known as "creaming and parking". 
 Work programme providers knew that - because they get paid on the basis of the results they achieve - they needed to concentrate on the jobseekers who were more likely to find work quickly. These people were "creamed" off and fast-tracked into work, thereby creating profit for the companies. 
 And the others? Those who need more time and investment? They were "parked" - left without help, to languish in the benefit system for months and years on end - in a situation that Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has said many times that he wanted to reverse. 
 In fact, his policies have perpetuated the problem. 
 And now George Osborne wants to spread this practice to all jobseekers, across the country. 
 It 's time the voting public woke up to what the Conservative Party is, and "parked" it in the history books where it belongs.

 The London Paralympic legacy, two years later: Vox Political's predictions were true

 Plight of the Paralympians: This is what they were being told to expect in September 2012. 
 Two years ago,  Vox Political  warned that the legacy of the London Paralympics would be the loss of disability benefits for the British athletes who took part. 
 "They have proven they're fit enough to work and therefore don't need [the money]," is how  this blog's article of the time  described the situation. "Right?" 
 Right. 
 Gratitude goes to Tom Pride for drawing attention  to the plight of basketball player Jon Pollock , who has been refused any benefits at all since he became unemployed after the Games. 
 His situation is exactly as  Vox Political  predicted in September 2012. Following up on previous warnings that the Coalition government had launched a campaign of hate against ordinary people who had been claiming incapacity or disability benefits, the article stated: "We knew that, once the chance for profile-boosting photo opportunities were over… the disability pogrom would be extended to paralympians." 
 How true those words were. 
 On the website  Inside the Games , Mr Pollock said: ""I retired after London and since then I'm not entitled to benefits because lottery funding isn't taxable. 
 "So when I go and apply for a job, the woman in the job centre said I should do charity work. But that doesn't pay the bills. "The job centre have been absolutely useless." 
 Mr Pollock, who has spina bifida, said: "I've given everything I have to my career and now I just feel like I've been tossed on the scrap heap. If I'd given two decades of service to anything else, I'd be fine but disability sport is just not recognised as a career it seems." 
 British Wheelchair Basketball says Mr Pollock declined support that was available, but this seems questionable. If you have a choice between spending two years looking fruitlessly for work and accepting help to plan a career after sport, you'd take the help - unless it wasn't worth having, which would be par for the course with our useless unelected government. 
 Why aren't ministers queueing up to tell us how well the UK treats disabled people who could have had normal careers but chose to represent their country instead? 
 They 're nowhere to be seen - because there isn't a photo opportunity involved.

 Unwell person incited to commit suicide - on David Cameron's Facebook page

 Just when you think you 've seen the lowest the Conservatives can go, something happens that is completely beyond the pale. 
 Yesterday a message was posted to David Cameron's  Facebook  page from a person who said they were going to commit suicide because they had been wrongly sanctioned. 
 The response - from one of Cameron's supporters - was as follows:  " Well get on with it then." 
 This serious disability hate remark has been allowed to remain ever since - on the _Prime Minister 's _own  Facebook  page, which we are led to understand is overseen by professionals who, let's not forget, paid for people to visit it and press the 'Like' button in order to make him look popular, and who may reasonably be expected to moderate such offensive behaviour off the page before it causes any real harm. 
 You can read more details  on the  Atos Miracles  Facebook page . 
 Part of the post that encouraged Cameron's supporter to incite this person to suicide went as follows: 
 "I am in receipt of ESA. I am trying my best to get better. I want to get better as I fully believe I have a lot of offer. However I am being continually lied about because when I ask for help I find a lot wrong with the system. Mainly due to the unfair cuts imposed by your government to public sector services and … as a consequence I have not got any better in fact I have got worse. A lot worse. To the point I no longer want to live anymore. 
 "I have now been sanctioned for not getting better. I don’t mind anymore today I telephoned them and told them this… Because of how many people your government have murdered through the Sanctions regime and taking away their rights to financial aid the DWP have stopped counting how many people have died. Yet George Osborne keeps telling everyone how well the country is prospering. This is a lie… the benefits office informed me I had telephoned the wrong number to discuss my sanction. Perhaps you have too many telephone numbers he did inform me it was my choice to take my life." 
 If you had seen this on  Facebook  , would  you  have told the author to "get on with it then"? 
 Or would you have sent a message of support and tried to get them the help they need? 
 The rational choice would be the latter. 
 If you had been overseeing that  Facebook  page, would you have allowed such a dangerous comment to remain or would you have removed it and reported the sender? 
 The very least that could have been done by the Tory overseers of Cameron's page would have been to check up on  the Job Centre advisor mentioned in the post, whose response was just as bad . "He did inform me it was my choice to take my life" - that person should have got in touch with the relevant authorities and rallied help, but no.  It seems some people will do anything for a "positive benefit outcome". 
 I'm told the person who wrote the message has been found and is safe and well - no thanks to the Job Centre, to the inhabitants and moderators of David Cameron's Facebook page, or to Cameron himself. 
 He should be utterly ashamed. 
 But he probably doesn 't even know this has happened.

 Tory policy on 'zero hours': Beggars can't be choosers

 Isn 't it nice to see some clear blue water emerge between the main political parties on an important issue? 
 Less than two weeks after Ed Miliband announced that  he would tackle the "epidemic" of zero-hours contracts  if Labour wins the next general election, the Conservatives have confirmed that Universal Credit - if they can ever get it working - will force jobseekers into those very contracts. 
 Labour said workers on zero-hours contracts should not be obliged to be available outside contracted hours; be free to work for other employers; have a right to compensation if shifts are cancelled at short notice; have 'clarity' from their employer about their employment status, terms and conditions; have the right to request a contract with a 'minimum amount of work' after six months, that could only be refused if employers could prove their business could not operate any other way; and have an automatic right to a fixed-hours contract after 12 months with the same employer. 
 At the time, the Tories said the number of zero-hours contracts had increased under the last Labour government, which had done nothing about it. 
 This tired excuse has been trotted out far too many times to be taken seriously any more, but it may have led some members of the public to believe that the Tories were distancing themselves from zero-hours contracts as well. They are, after all, supposed to be The Party of More Choice. Perhaps they are, themselves, less than keen on this kind of exploitation. 
 Not a bit of it! 
 The Guardian  revealed yesterday that conditions will be imposed on the receipt of Universal Credit, meaning that - for the first time ever -  jobseekers could lose their benefits if they refuse to take zero-hour jobs  - for three months or longer. 
 Currently, people on Jobseekers' Allowance are able to refuse such jobs without facing penalties. 
 The policy change was revealed in a letter from employment minister Esther McVey to Labour MP Sheila Gilmore. She said Job Centre "coaches" would be able to "mandate to zero-hours contracts" - basically forcing them to accept this kind of exploitation by employers. 
 The DWP has also stated: "We expect claimants to do all they reasonably can to look for and move into paid work. If a claimant turns down a particular vacancy (including zero-hours contract jobs) a sanction may be applied." 
 The message from the Conservatives - the Party of More Choice - is clear:  Beggars can 't be choosers. 
 Their chums on the boards of big businesses want more profits, and know the way to get it - employ people on low pay and with no employee benefits. Zero-hours contracts mean you can be made to work fewer hours than you need in order for employers to have to pay National Insurance credits for you. You don't get sick pay; holiday pay; or a pension. And you'll probably still be on benefits, meaning the work that you do is subsidised by other hardworking taxpayers, most of whom earn only a little more than you do. 
 It's a racket - as bad as workfare/mandatory work activity/the work programme/whatever-they're-calling-it-today, in which taxpayers subsidise work carried out by jobseekers for participating employers, hugely boosting those firms' profits while ensuring that the number of people without proper, paid jobs remains high. 
 Their attitude is that, if you don't have a job, you are a beggar. 
 Beggars can 't be choosers. 
 So  they 'll  choose what you do, and they - or their boardroom chums - will benefit from it. 
 If you are a working taxpayer, think about this before casting your vote later this month - and especially before you do so in May 2015:  A vote for the Conservative Party  means  more  of your fellow citizens will be  prevented  from getting proper jobs and becoming contributing members of society by the greedy - and idle - rich. 
 A vote for the Conservative Party  means  more  of your tax money going to  subsidise  fat business board members who already have more money than they can ever use. 
 A vote for the Conservative Party  means a better life for them and their friends - and  a poorer life for you . 
 You 'd have to be mad to choose that.

 Shame on you, Job Centre! Getting people off the dole isn't getting them into work!

 One of  Vox Political  's many astute commenters made an extremely good point about government schemes to get people (a) off the dole and (b) into work. They said the fundamental question we should be asking the DWP is:  " How many people have you turned into productive taxpaying workers who do not claim any benefits at all?" 
 It is as though they were prescient and could predict the way the debate has developed this week, firstly with the bogus DWP press release  that has allowed some of us to suggest that we should judge the DWP by results, not targets ; and now with the declaration by the Commons Work and Pensions committee that Job Centre Plus staff should be rewarded for the number of people they get into work, not just the number they get off the dole. 
 It seems this is an idea whose time has come. 
 Employment minister Esther McVey's time - like that of her boss Iain Duncan Smith - has been and gone. Do not expect her to do anything about this. 
 Job Centre staff are currently given incentives to get benefit claimants off the dole, and this has led to wholesale abuse of the system of sanctions which can mean people are banned from claiming benefits for three whole years after a third 'offence'. 
 People have been sanctioned because the dates on which they applied for jobs did not tally with the number of jobs they were supposed to seek every week - as the Job Centre week starts on Tuesday. 
 They have been sanctioned for arriving late at their signing-on appointment - because a job interview overran. 
 They've been sanctioned because they didn't apply online for a job, as advised, because the job had 'expired'. 
 They have been sanctioned while on Workfare because signing on - as advised by the Job Centre - made them late for the placement. 
 They have even been sanctioned for failing to apply for jobs,  after they had succeeded in getting a job . 
 The Work and Pensions committee has diplomatically described this as a "haphazard" approach to assessing claimants, saying many were referred for sanctions inappropriately, or "in circumstances in which common sense would dictate that discretion should have been applied". 
 Common sense has no place in a Job Centre overseen by a Conservative-run DWP.  The people who work there are under the cosh, just as much as the claimants. They have a target to meet - five per cent of jobseekers off the books every month, unless I am mistaken (perhaps readers could provide the correct figure if I am). 
 Sanctioning rates in the year to October 2012 stood at 4.2 per cent, so staff were failing to hit this target - but after a sterner regime was introduced in that month, sanctioning increased to five per cent. 
 The system has been particularly cruel on younger claimants. In the year to October 2012, the sanction rate for those aged 18-24 was eight per cent, per month. 
 The number of sanctions in the year to 30 June 2013 was around 860,000 - the highest number in any 12-month period since statistics began to be published in their present form in April 2000. 
 The committee also said the DWP needed to monitor financial hardship suffered by claimants who lose their benefits. This could include publishing information on the number of claimants "signposted" to food banks by Job Centres and the reasons given for this action. 
 It is as if Dame Anne Begg (who chairs the committee) has been reading this blog. Readers will know that part of  Vox Political  's Freedom of Information request about incapacity/ESA claimant mortality referred to the well-being of those who had been thrown off-benefit altogether. 
 I can tell you now that  the DWP does not monitor what happens to these people, nor does it have any plan to do so in the future . They are thrown to the wolves. 
 Dame Anne was  quoted in  The Guardian , saying: "JCP must be very clearly incentivised to get people into work, not just off benefits. 
 "The processes by which JCP currently establishes claimants' needs are haphazard and prone to missing crucial information about a person's barriers to working, including homelessness and drug dependency. A more thorough and systematic approach to assessing claimants' needs is required." 
 She added: "Whilst conditionality is a necessary part of the benefit system, jobseekers need to have confidence that the sanctioning regime is being applied appropriately, fairly and proportionately and the government needs to assure itself that sanctioning is achieving its intended objective of incentivising people to seek work." 
 This is exactly what  Vox Political  has been saying since Rachel Reeves described Labour's compulsory job guarantee policy on finding work for claimants, last week. Reeves' words were derided by visitors to certain blogs who said she was as bad as the Conservatives. Now that some flesh is appearing on the bones of her strategy, we can see that this was undeserved. 
 According to the BBC , ministers cited the recent fall in unemployment to say the system was working, but they failed to mention what their intention was. 
 Was it working in getting people into jobs? 
 Or was it only working in getting people off-benefit, as claimed by the committee? 
 If people were going into jobs, were they  real  jobs,  or fake "self-employed" jobs of the kind that the BBC itself investigated last year , intended only to get claimant numbers down? 
 What about the rise and rise of Workfare schemes, in which claimants are knocked off the unemployment statistics but continue receiving an equivalent amount to JSA - from the DWP - for a full week's work, effectively subsidising commercial firms? 
 It seems likely that ministers will be reluctant to answer those questions. 
 While institutions like the BBC are determined to broadcast  inaccurate stories based on falsified figures supplied by those ministers , it seems they have no incentive to do so.

 Unemployed Face Benefit Sanctions If Bad Weather Prevents Them From Getting To Jobcentres

 A Freedom of Information Request (FOI) by Plaid Cymru has discovered that jobseekers could face benefit sanctions if bad weather (including snow) prevents them from attending a Jobcentre appointment. 
 Plaid Cymru asked the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) whether exemptions would apply to the policy of applying benefit sanctions against unemployed people who fail to attend Jobcentre appointments due to poor weather conditions (such as snow), or other unforeseen circumstances.

 Government descends into inter-departmental squabbling over Universal Credit

 It seems there has been an argument between Iain Duncan Smith 's DWP and Francis Maude's Cabinet Office, and now the much-troubled Universal Credit project has no IT experts working on it. 
 Good. It's a terrible idea, designed to remove money from the people who need it most. 
 The project aims to update benefit claimants' entitlements in 'real time', ensuring that they only ever receive what government regulations say they should. Sadly, there is no commitment to update the entitlement amounts in 'real time', so people will always be getting less than they need, as inflation boosts prices beyond their range. 
 Minutes of a Universal Credit 'board meeting',  leaked to  The Guardian , show that IT experts from the Cabinet Office are pulling out of the project and the DWP must now search for somebody else with the skills needed to take on the work. 
 This means more delays and an even greater cost. This is unlikely to bother Iain Duncan Smith, who sees the project as his legacy to the nation and will pay any amount to see it through -  in sharp contrast to his attitude towards the benefit claimants for whose livelihoods his department is responsible . 
 It seems the argument arose because of Mr… Smith's vanity - he insisted on a "twin-track" approach to the project, keeping current work going in order to make it possible for claimants to use Universal Credit before the 2015 election while also funnelling money and time into a purely web-based system that will not require Job Centre staff to fill in claimants' details.  One may presume that he will happily sack the excess Job Centre staff after that system is complete. 
 Those on the current version will be tranferred onto the digital system when it is ready, we are told. 
 A separately-leaked document made it clear that the withdrawal of the Cabinet Office expertise is one of the most serious problems facing the project because the DWP will now have to try to find people with the necessary skills in the market, and may not be able to afford the cost. 
 It is interesting that  this document is a risk assessment . Does anybody remember the furore over the NHS risk assessment, when the Health and Social Care Act was working its way through Parliament like an unhappy bowel movement? Even though these documents are almost always publicly available, that one was jealously guarded by Andrew Lansley and still has not seen the light of day. 
 Of course the different government departments are claiming that nothing is wrong and all is going according to plan, and this might be true - if we're discussing the kind of plan that changes with the wind. 
 Meanwhile, Universal Credit is increasingly becoming a symbol of the government creating it - not only is it monstrously expensive but it also doesn't work.

 Poll result reveals DWP doublespeak on the Bedroom Tax

 The Department for Work and Pensions is heralding the result of a new poll as proof that a large majority of people support its controversial Bedroom Tax policy -  in fact the findings prove nothing of the sort . 
 Headlined (incorrectly) 'Poll shows support for removal of spare room subsidy' - there is no such thing as a spare room subsidy so it cannot be removed -  yesterday's press release  relies on some not-so-subtle wordplay and the gullibility of the reader to make its case. 
 If you want to find out how many people supported the government's policy, you'll have to look somewhere else because it is not directly identified anywhere in the article. 
 "New independent research shows there is strong public support for reducing under-occupation and overcrowding in social housing," it begins - and this is fair enough. 
 People do indeed want to reduce under-occupation in social housing - but we have seen, time and time again, that people think there must be adequate social housing available for people who want, or need, to move. This is not what the Conservative and Liberal Democrat government are offering. 
 Instead, people are being told they can either move into smaller, privately-rented accommodation that will create more expense for the government, or if this is unavailable, pay the Bedroom Tax at 14 per cent of their eligible rent for one room and 25 per cent for two or more. Whatever they do, they end up having to pay more. That is not reasonable. 
 "In a poll [of 2,021 people] conducted by Ipsos MORI, 78% of respondents said they thought it was important to tackle the problem, which has led to nearly one-third of social housing tenants who receive Housing Benefit living in homes that are too big for their needs," the article continues. 
 What problem is this, then? The problem of people occupying social rented properties that are too large for them, as the ConDems want you to believe? Or the problem of successive governments failing to build social housing that is adequate for the needs of the population?  The latter seems more likely, don 't you think? 
 None of the information around that 78 per cent figure suggests that 1,576 people support the Bedroom Tax.  I  happen to believe it is important to tackle the bottleneck, in order to relieve the overcrowding issue. The Bedroom Tax won't do that, though.  It will just take money from poor people. 
 Was support for the Bedroom Tax indicated anywhere in these results? No. The closest we get is: "The polling also found that 54% agreed that it is fair that people of working age, who live in social housing, should receive less Housing Benefit if they have more bedrooms than they need." Even this does not suggest that those questioned agreed with the amount the government is taking from hardworking social tenants. 
 Curiously, the same proportion of those polled - 54 per cent - said they believed "the coalition government’s removal of the spare room subsidy policy will encourage those receiving less housing benefit to improve their personal situation by, for example, finding work." 
 There are a couple of points to make here. Firstly - there is no policy to remove the spare room subsidy because, as previously mentioned, the spare room subsidy has never existed. Secondly, the idea that people can find work (or find better-paying work) is a bad joke. 
 Only yesterday, a staffer at my local Job Centre was heard admitting that their office had received no new job advertisements in several weeks, and there is no evidence that this is a unique case.  It is unrealistic to suggest this as a reasonable way out. 
 The fact that both these questions received 54 per cent support leads one to question how many of the respondents were affected by the Tax. My guess would be 46 per cent or less. The  other  46 per cent, of course. 
 DWP ministerial rentamouth Esther McVey was on hand to provide the commentary (Iain Duncan Smith is still in hiding, one presumes). She said: "This shows that the public agree that action was needed to tackle overcrowding and to make better use of our housing stock." Except, as already pointed out,  it doesn 't show that the public agree with the government . 
 She added: "We have seen our Housing Benefit bill exceed £24 billion – an increase of 50% in just 10 years – and this had to be brought under control." 
 The Bedroom Tax will do nothing in this respect  - in fact, the bill may increase (people moving into private rented property would receive more benefit, and people who have been evicted because they can't pay their bills after the Tax was imposed will be a burden on councils, who will have to put them up in more expensive B&B accommodation). 
 Also,  increasing numbers of working people are being forced to claim housing benefit because companies are making sure their wages are too low to provide a decent living . Almost a million working people were claiming housing benefit in May this year, and that figure seems sure to have been exceeded by the time the next set of statistics is released on November 13 (Wednesday). 
 Apparently it is bad for unemployed people to claim the benefits they deserve, but perfectly fine for companies to have the lousy wages they pay topped up at the taxpayers' expense. 
 That 's government doublespeak for you!

 Why blame the civil service, Mr… Smith? They only do what you tell them to!

 Don't blame Whitehall: Civil servants are highly-trained experts in their field; Conservative politicians are amateurs with opinions. Who do YOU think is responsible for the cock-up called Universal Credit? [Picture: Daily Telegraph] 
 Isn 't it a shame for the Tories that they hung their 'welfare' 'reforms' on an incompetent like Iain Duncan Smith? 
 Accused of wasting £140 million of taxpayers' money on his white elephant Universal Credit scheme (or is it scam?) he can at least take comfort that the latest report followed his lead and fell back on what is now becoming a Conservative Party Standard Excuse:  Blame the civil service. 
 That won't wash, though. The real reason,  as detailed in this blog previously , is lack of interest by Conservative Party ministers like Smith himself. 
 We call him 'RTU' because we believe his incompetence as an Army officer led to him being 'Returned To Unit' and eventually shuffled out of the service and it is this history that seems to be repeating itself here. 
 Let's have a look at the "alarmingly weak" management for which the Secretary-in-a-State was rightly criticised by the Commons Public Accounts Committee this week. 
 We know that the project is now well behind schedule, despite protestations to the contrary from RTU and the Department for Work and Pensions. A planned pilot roll-out in April was restricted to just one Job Centre, where they handled only the simplest cases, working them out on spreadsheets because the IT system is open to fraud. 
 Since then  it has been started in Hammersmith , in London, where its success or failure is not yet known. 
 It is now doubtful whether the project can still be delivered, on-budget, by its 2017 deadline.  If it is, what kind of service will it provide? 
 Of the £2.4 billion set aside, £425 million has already been spent and a sum between £140 million and £161 million is likely to be written off,  depending on whose figures you believe . 
 We know that  a secretary was allowed to sign off £23 million worth of purchases  because RTU's systems were so lazy. Does anybody even know what this money bought? 
 "From the outset, the department has failed to grasp the nature and enormity of the task; failed to monitor and challenge progress regularly; and, when problems arose, failed to intervene promptly," said Public Accounts Committee chair, Margaret Hodge. She described the system's implementation as not only poor but  " extraordinarily"  poor. 
 And she said  the pilot scheme was not a proper pilot  , as "It does not deal with the key issues that universal credit must address: the volume of claims; their complexity; change in claimants' circumstances; and the need for claimants to meet conditions for continuing entitlement to benefit". 
 The report by the committee singled out the DWP's permanent secretary, Robert Devereux, for particular criticism, saying he only became aware of problems in 'ad hoc' reviews, because reporting arrangements were inadequate and had not alerted him to problems. Even after he knew of major problems, he did not closely monitor the project, the report stated. 
 It seems Conservatives on the committee wanted more criticisms to be included, and  The Guardian  has stated that senior Tories have said they would accept Devereaux's resignation, if offered. 
 Let 's face it: we've been here before. 
 Michael Gove's Education Department is now in a terrible mess because he brought in a gang of "advisors" to operate "above" his officials - who have meanwhile faced huge cuts in their workforce and a disastrous fall in morale. Gove brought his ignorant mates in to force their foolishness on the professionals,  as this blog reported in June . 
 That was when  The Spectator  weighed in against the civil service , lodging an advance claim that if Universal Credit flops it will be due to the civil service, but if it succeeds it will be a victory for Tory ministers alone. 
 what a lot of nonsense. 
 Civil servants do what elected Members of Parliament tell them to do. They pay attention to the wishes of their political leaders and apply their considerable expertise to the problems set for them, in order to produce the required result, within budget, while complying with the strictures laid down by those political leaders. 
 They are very good at their job . 
 If they are failing, then the problem must lie with the politicians. If a goal is unrealistic, then blaming the 'help' is totally unproductive - it only serves to make them hostile. 
 And, let 's face it, we've all seen sheep with more intelligence than Iain Duncan Smith.

 Several months ago this blog accused Iain Duncan Smith of being a liar and a coward  because, not only had he fabricated statistics on the number of people leaving benefits because of his new benefit cap, but he had also weaseled his way out of an appearance before the Commons Work and Pensions Committee to account for this behaviour. 
 The very next day,  we had to apologise (to readers) and publish a correction  saying that the man we call 'Returned To Unit' would be attending a follow-up meeting in September, at which the 100,000-signature petition calling him to account for the benefit cap lies, organised by Jayne Linney and Debbie Sayers, would also be presented to MPs. 
 Apparently the meeting was being timed to coincide with publication of the DWP's annual report for 2012-13. 
 Now it is November, and we have still had no meeting with RTU. Nor have we seen the annual report, which is now almost eight months late. Meanwhile the calamities at the DWP have been mounting up. 
 The latest appears  in a  Guardian  report published yesterday , about the ongoing disaster that is Universal Credit. You may remember, Dear Reader, that the Department for Work and Pensions has admitted it had to write off £34 million that had been spent on the scheme; it subsequently emerged that the total amount to be written off might actually be as high as £161 million. 
 The  Guardian  article appears to confirm this, adding £120 million to the £34 already written off if the DWP follows one of two possible plans to take the nightmarish scheme forward. 
 This would restart Universal Credit from scratch, creating a system based on the Internet - and reducing the need for Job Centre staff - and  tends to confirm the suggestion that staff are seen as a liability in the government 's plan to cut back on benefit payments ;  despite being told to bully, harass and intimidate everyone who darkens their doors, they have an annoying inclination to help people claim the benefits due to them . 
 The other plan would attempt to salvage the existing system, and is understood to be favoured by the Secretary-in-a-State. The drawback is that  it could lead to an even greater waste of taxpayers ' money  (not that this has ever been a consideration for Mr… Smith in the past. He'll waste millions like water while depriving people of the pennies they need to survive). 
 Universal Credit aims to merge six major benefits and tax credits into one, restricting eligibility for the new benefit in order to cut down on payouts. It relies on the government creating a computer programme that can synchronise systems run by HM Revenue and Customs, the DWP itself, and employers. So far, this has proved impossible and a planned rollout in April was restricted to just one Job Centre, where staff handled only the simplest claims and worked them out on paper.  Later revelations showed that the system as currently devised has no way of weeding out fraudulent claims. 
 A leaked risk assessment says the web-based scheme is "unproven… at this scale", and that it would not be possible to roll out the new system "within the preferred timescale". Smith has continually maintained that it will be delivered on time and on budget but, as concerns continue to be raised by senior civil servants that systems are not working as expected and there are too many design flaws,  it seems likely this is a career-ending claim . 
 Is this why he hasn 't deigned to account for himself before the Work and Pensions Committee? 
 Earlier this week,  the government lost its appeal against a court ruling that its regulations for Workfare and other mandatory work activity schemes were illegal . Public Interest Lawyers, who handled the case against the government, has taken the view that anyone who fell foul of the regulations may now take action to get their money back. But the matter is complicated by the fact that the government unwisely passed a retrospective law to legalise the rules, in a bid to stop the 228,000 benefit claimants it had sanctioned after they refused to work for their benefits from demanding the money that ministers had - in effect - stolen from them. Iain Duncan Smith is the man behind this mess. 
 Is this why he hasn 't deigned to account for himself before the committee? 
 We have yet to learn why this man felt justified in claiming 8,000 - and then 12,000 - people had left benefits because of the £26,000 cap he introduced in April (he claimed it is equal to average family income but in fact it is £5,000 and change short of that amount as he failed to consider benefits that such families could draw). Information from polling company Ipsos Mori showed that the real number of people who had dropped their claims after hearing of the scheme was more likely to be 450 - just nine per cent of the figure he originally quoted. 
 Is this why he hasn 't put a meeting with the committee in his diary? 
 Perhaps we should not be surprised, though - it seems that RTU has never had a decent grip on the way his department works. For example, he allowed George Osborne to cancel Disability Living Allowance for one-fifth of claimants in 2010, claiming that the benefit had been "spiralling" out of control because it had 3.1 million claimants - triple the number since it was introduced in 1992. Smith said the rise was "inexplicable" but in fact the explanation is simplicity itself,  as  The Guardian  's Polly Toynbee pointed out just two days ago : 
 "DLA is only paid to those of working age, but when they retire they keep it, so as more people since 1992 move into retirement, numbers rise fast. There has been no change in numbers with physical conditions, despite a larger population; back injuries have declined with the decline of heavy industry. There has been a real growth in numbers with learning disabilities: more premature babies survive but with disabilities, while those with Down's syndrome no longer die young. More people with mental illness claim DLA now, following changes in case law: there has been no increase in mental illness, with 7% of the population seriously ill enough to be receiving treatment, yet only 1% claim DLA. Psychosis is the commonest DLA diagnosis, hardly a trivial condition. This pattern of disability mirrors the rest of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, with nothing exceptional here." 
 In other words, from the moment he took over this hugely important government department, with its huge - and controversial - budget, Iain Duncan Smith had about as much understanding of its workings as a child. 
 It seems Sir John Major was exactly right when he expressed fears about the DWP Secretary's ability last week, claiming his genius "has not been proven". 
 Is this why we 've seen neither hide nor … head of the Secretary of State? 
 Finally, Dear Reader, you will be aware that  Vox Political  submitted a Freedom of Information request to the DWP, asking for up-to-date statistics on the number of Employment and Support Allowance claimants who have died during a claim or while appealing against a decision about a claim - and that  the request was dismissed on the indefensible grounds that it was "vexatious" . This was not good enough so the matter went to the Information Commissioner's office and, according to an email received this week, will soon be brought to a conclusion. 
 Is this why Iain Duncan Smith is hiding? 
 Perhaps it's time to drag him out of his bolt-hole and force some answers out of him. 
 Jayne (Linney), in her blog, has called on people who use Twitter to start tweeting demands for Smith to come forward, using the hashtags  #whereisIDS  and  #DWPLateReview . This is good, and those of you who do so are welcome to use any of the information in this article as ammunition in such a campaign. 
 There is nothing to stop anyone writing to the press - local or national - to ask what is going on and why benefit claimants are being left in suspense about the future of their claims. People have to work out how they will pay their bills, and the continued uncertainty caused by Mr… Smith's catalogue of calamities is causing problems up and down the country. 
 A short message to your MP might help stir the Secretary of State out of his slumber, also. 
 In fact, let 's use all the tools at our disposal to expose this man for what he is - just as this blog stated in July and in May: A liar and a coward  who has committed contempt of Parliament and should be expelled - not just from public office, but from public life altogether .
