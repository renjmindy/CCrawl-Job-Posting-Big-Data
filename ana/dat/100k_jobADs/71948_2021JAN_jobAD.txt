 We're looking for an experienced front-end software engineer (app interface developer) with a strong technical mind that wishes to participate to a complex and challenging software development project. 
 Our goal is to build a dentistry practice management software that revolutionises all the features available on the market at the moment, and then some. 
 Payments, HR, communication, scheduling, analytics - our software will do them all. Currently, dentists are struggling with the need to use third party apps to complete certain tasks. The present software solutions available on the market are not innovative at all: they are just the digitalised version of the old pen-and-paper systems. No attention has been given to user experience, accessibility or system efficiency. 
 With the help of Artificial Intelligence and a team of industry specialists, we're building a one-of-a-kind software solution that will drastically improve management and other internal processes' efficiency, while considerably reducing time waste and protecting the dentists against litigation. 
 Join a dynamic team of developers and designers and make the most out of the London start-up life!
