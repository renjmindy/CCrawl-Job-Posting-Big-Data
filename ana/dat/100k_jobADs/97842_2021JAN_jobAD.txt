 Company Description 
 How about flexible hours that let you do your thing, whatever your thing is. The opportunity to grow. Professionally, personally and financially. How about the chance to be part of a company that’s primarily run by independent business owners and that’s active in your community. That’s helped more than 300,000 Canadian families with sick kids through Ronald McDonald House. If that sounds good to you, then we’d love to hear from you. 
 Job Description 
 I am looking for an individual who is available throughout the whole day and looking for part time hours. We are looking for someone who is energetic, strives in a team environment, and able to multi task. All members of our team are trained and expected to display strong levels of guest satisfaction with every guest that comes to our restaurant. Our team is looking to add strong communicators, with a strength in customer service. 
 Qualifications 
 Customer service experience is a plus, however we can train and help with it. 
 Additional Information
