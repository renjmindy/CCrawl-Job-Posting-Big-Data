  The 5-Step Approach To A Successful Job Search  
 Ariella Coombs 
 March 11, 2015 
 For most people, landing a great job doesn’t just happen overnight. You have to work at it - you have to be patient, but proactive.  Related:   3 Sneaky Ways To Research A Company  However, there are ways you can speed up the process. It’s time to get more efficient with your job search efforts! Here’s my 5-step approach to a successful job search: 
 
 1. Determine your goals & priorities. 
 What do you want to achieve in your life AND career? What kinds of jobs will allow you to achieve those goals? 
 2. Analyze your options. 
 Research companies of interest and  create a company bucket list . What companies can you see yourself working for? Once you’ve created your company bucket list, set up informational interviews with employees from those companies to learn more about the culture, hiring process, and anything else you’re curious about. Also, do a little research on salary. Would you need to take a pay cut if you were to take a job at your dream company? Once you gather those numbers, determine your “walk away rate.” What is the absolute lowest amount of money you’re willing to accept without having to eat Ramen noodles every day? If the company can’t at least offer you that number, then you know it’s not worth pursuing. 
 3. Recognize your strengths. 
 Determine the problem you solve. We’re all fixers - what do YOU fix? Make a list of your previous accomplishments, hard and soft skills, and unique selling points (what do you offer that other candidates can’t?) Highlight your strengths - If you’ve worked at the same company for 15 years, showcase your longevity at the company, emphasize your extensive experience/skills in the area you worked in. 
 4. Establish your brand. 
 Now that you know what you want and what you offer, it’s time to brand yourself. Remember, everyone has a brand, but it’s up to you on how much you want to control it ( brand or BE branded! ). Here are some things you can do to establish a bomb-ass brand: 
 
 Create a unique branding statement that showcases your unique selling points. 
 Update your job search materials (resume, cover letter, LinkedIn profile, etc) with appropriate content and keywords. 
 Build an online brand (update social media profiles regularly, create an industry-specific blog, etc). 
 
 5. Demonstrate your value. 
 Show  employers that you’ll be a valuable asset to the company,  don’t just tell them.  You can do this by… 
 
 Sharing  accomplishment stories 
 Quantifying your accomplishments 
 Demonstrating how you can solve their problem 
 Showing enthusiasm for both the job AND the company 
 
 Make sure you figure out the “pain points” of the company and show them how you can alleviate those problems. What do you bring to the table that other candidates can’t? (Also, show them you’re worth their time by respecting their time, sending thank you notes, and following up!) What works for you?  Tweet me at @AriellaCoombs  and let me know!
