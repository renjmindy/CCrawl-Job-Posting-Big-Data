 World Freaks Out As Trump Tells Obvious Truths!!!!! -> 
 Feel Good Story Of The Day!!!! Obama, Clinton Loyalists Can't Find Jobs!!!!!!! 
 Posted on  January 12, 2017  by  suyts 
 
 
 
 This is a couple of days old, and I’ve been using it as a ‘pick-me-up’ type of thing.  When I see or read about something depressing, I just go back to this story and chuckle a bit. 
 I don’t’ have any commentary on this.  It’s just a feel good story! 
 
 Obama, Clinton Loyalists Can't Find Jobs 
 With Republicans now controlling both chambers of Congress and the executive branch, many Democrats are struggling to find work in a city now dominated by the GOP. 
 With President-elect Trump's inauguration just around the corner, thousands of President Obama’s appointees and hundreds of Clinton campaign staffers are looking to enter the D.C. job market—where the demand couldn’t be any lower, according to a  report  in Politico. 
 
 The Trump tornado is tearing up post-election planning around the Beltway. It’s not just that those 4,000 administration jobs are no longer available to Hillary for America alumni, or that failed Senate candidates like Russ Feingold and Katie McGinty won’t be able to hire their staff on the Hill. There are also the lobbying firms, trade associations and corporate government affairs offices that are pitching senior Obama aides’ resumes into the round file while scrambling to hire operatives with Republican connections. 
 It’s insult to injury for a generation of young operatives who are still managing their shock and grief from Hillary Clinton’s loss. And for those who want to fight to keep President Barack Obama’s legacy from being erased, there aren’t a lot of places ready to pay them to do it. 
 
 “It feels like there are just thousands of us trying to find a job, and there are no jobs,” longtime Clinton aide Mira Patel told Politico. 
 According to Julian Ha, who leads the government affairs and trade association practice at the executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles, the demand for Republicans, especially those close to people being chosen for key roles in Trump’s administration, is much more “robust.” 
 “Clients are all pivoting, and they’re all frankly trying to figure it out just like we all are right now,” he told Politico. 
 The report notes that many Obama loyalists are faring better out West in Silicon Valley, but Clinton aides continue to struggle, with one progressive career guru commenting on their palpable anger, frustration, anxiety and burnout. 
 To help each other out, Democrats are hosting jobs fairs in the city, while executives at Google have organized an online resume bank for Clinton and Obama alumni, encouraging 100 other companies like Facebook and Netflix to draw from it, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
 But this shouldn’t come as the surprise it is to these folks—wave elections are an occupational hazard of working in the Beltway. More seasoned Democrats even tried to warn the younger generation. 
 “Never count on a Democratic administration,” Patel remembered being told, reports Politico. “I was like, ‘Oh, come on, this is gonna be great.’” 
 
 Awww …. the poor babes are now experiencing the misery they sowed to the rest of us people.  Awww ……

 I can't keep up with all the companies and jobs the are predicting anymore. 
…but then those jobs are for the bitter clingers 
 Lastest I read was Amazon was going to hire 100,000 new employees. 
 We are, of course, giving credit to Trump…and probably most of it is 
….but I can't help but wonder how much of it is also getting rid of Obama 
 All these companies couldn't have just decided to hire millions of new employees. They had to have been sitting on this for a long time.

 Google once ran a context with a complex puzzle to hire talent. Guess they are no longer interested in talent.

 The basic difference between all of us is to what degree you empower your emotion, or your rationality. Fairly obvious that the balance needs to be brought back more evenly. 
And which one should be making political policy.

 I stole this from facebook…. 
 Know the signs, spot the symptoms, and save a life. 
 Do You Know Someone Suffering From Trump Unacceptance & Resistance Disorder (TURD)? 
 TURD is a pattern of pathologically dissociative and psychotic behavior, first observed in the late hours of November 8th 2016, and increasing in severity with passing time. 
 Sufferers of TURD often exhibit pronounced cognitive dissonance, sudden bouts of childlike rage, rioting and uncontrollable crying. 
 People with TURD are characterized by a persistent unwillingness to accept that Donald Trump is going to Make America Great Again. 
 TURD Is caused by the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States of America. For many, both in America and worldwide, this was a shocking and unexpected outcome; their preferred news sources having failed to inform them that the alternative candidate was a criminal parasite in such ill health she got chucked into the back of a van like a kidnap victim. 
 Research is ongoing, but TURD appears to correlate closely with the following environmental and behavioral factors: 
 Membership in the Democratic Party 
 Identifying as a feminist 
 Currently enrolled in college, and/or possession of a Liberal Arts college degree 
 Living in a densely populated metropolitan area 
 Massive student debt 
 Spotty or non-existent work history 
 Patients with TURD are very resistant to treatment, and dangerous in large groups. Any possibility of treatment requires that they be separated from their hive-mind support apparatus; they cannot begin the process of accepting reality in the presence of encouragement towards delusion and irrationality. Separation may require the assistance of law enforcement. 
 If you have a friend or loved one suffering from TURD, urge them to seek treatment. Together we can beat this scourge

 The Seattle-Atlanta game. From the start I thought that Seattle would have a lot of trouble, and the best team won. That said, Wilson's throws were a little off today, Seattle lost an offensive lineman early, and the defense was off too (they're missing Earl Thomas). 
 Still the officials were obviously against the Seahawks today. Basically, they weren't calling penalties against Atlanta-holdings not called, a helmet-to-helmet after Wilson started his slide wasn't called, and Baldwin was down by contact on that last fumble, to name a few. 
 It's interesting that when officials are biased in favor of the Seahawks-you never hear the end of it. When the officials are biased against the Seahawks-you never hear of it. It's like the Democrats and Republicans. 
 Well, I have no skin in the playoffs now, so I can sit back and enjoy the outcome-or not. I'll be rooting against the AFC team.

 Yeh, it was rough for the Seahawks. I know it was disappointing for many fans, but, in most any regards it was a successful season for the Seahawks. And, yeh, they missed Thomas a lot. I think if they find some consistency at RB for the whole year, next year, they'll be a much better team.

 It was a great GB-Dallas game, except that a few bad calls went notoriously in favor of GB. I think the Cowboys were Seahawked by the officials. 
 Also,I saw a Steeler offensive player with his arms wrapped completely around a KC defender and holding wasn't called. I think KC was Seahawked by the officials too. I believe I heard these KC-Steeler officials are doing the Super Bowl. I guess the fix is in.

 Yeh, I didn't like a few of the calls. And, the Chiefs TE, Kelce is calling out the refs. They were both great games, with poor endings. Thinking about writing a post ….

 The International Monetary Fund is raising its forecast for the U.S. economy this year and in 2018, reflecting an expected boost from the economic policies of President-elect Donald Trump.

 Somebody give me the long version on this….I don't get it 
I know the IMF is shady….but raising their prediction seems like a good thing to me 
Too many people believe what they say (that shouldn't I know) but seems like predicting our economy is going to do better would boost more manufacturing, retail, etc…and influence these companies coming back here
