 Combining your career with family nursing 
 A growing number of people have to balance their career with the nursing care they provide to their relatives. There are lots of ways in which employers can help you combine your career with family nursing. 
 An initiative to combine careers with family nursing has been launched by the Hessian Ministry for Social Affairs and Integration, the AOK (Hessen’s healthcare fund), berufundfamilie gGmbH, and the Education Centre for the Hessian Economy (“Bildungswerk der Hessischen Wirtschaft”). This charter for the reconciliation of careers and nursing care is unique in Germany, and 134 employers with around 300,000 employees have already committed themselves to implementing a human resources policy that respects their staff’s nursing responsibilities. This is a strong indicator of the companies’ sustainable recruitment methods.
