 Careers events during Semester 1 
 Posted on  September 24, 2015  by  researchstudentcareers 
 
 Now that the new semester is underway I wanted to give you an overview of some the careers events which are taking place on campus over the coming weeks. 
 Our updated programme of careers workshops specifically tailored for PhD students is available online. This includes workshops to help you review your career plans and market yourself effectively. There are sessions for those of you who are planning an academic career and for those who are considering wider career options. You will also find MBTI personality type sessions and an employer networking event. Most but not all of these events are organised on a College wide basis so please follow the appropriate links. 
 
 PhD Career Workshops  
 
 In addition, there is an  extensive programme of careers events   open to all University of Edinburgh students . This includes opportunities to network with employers at events including careers fairs and at a series of employer’s recruitment presentations which runs from late September onwards. 
 Around 120 employers will be attending the main annual  Careers Fair  which is being held on  Monday 5th and Tuesday 6th October . This is a great chance to talk to employers about the career opportunities they can offer and to get some advice on what they look for when recruiting. Many of these organisations are specifically  targeting PhD students . Full details of all organisations attending can be found in the  Careers Fair Guide 2015 
 A full listings of all careers events can be found on MyCareerHub:
