 Good Job, Booaaahhh

 Like many people, the past few months of my life have been dominated by  Red Dead Redemption II . On a near daily basis, I was riding the plains, helping passerbys, righting wrongs, occasionally causing wrongs, hunting animals, chasing bounties, and more. It's safe to say that I got my money's worth out of Rockstar's latest game, and it's earned a god-tier level among the many games I've played in my lifetime. 
 Rockstar definitely put their all into this video game, crafting something that truly feels alive and breathing. I don't think there was a single moment where I thought I was seeing something repeat, which is an astounding feat when you consider how many games have repetitive side missions (even  Spider-Man  , another fantastic game from this year, had a few repetitive moments). But Rockstar did an equally impressive feat with the story, which defied all expectations by being engaging despite being a prequel to a well known game. 
 While  Red Dead Redemption II  features the original game's protagonist John Marston, he's not the focus this time around. Instead, Arthur Morgan, the right hand man to leader Dutch Van Der Linde, takes center stage, and goes on a pretty amazing journey. Regardless of the “path” you choose, Morgan is still a complicated man, filled with past doubts and mistakes that really make you feel for him. As the story progresses, that attachment only grows, and is probably heightened depending on how many hours you dump into the game.. 
 Of course, one of the hurdles and complaints I heard from people playing the game was that the beginning was a little too long. And while I agree that it was, if you jumped ship at that point, then you really missed out on something truly special. The commitment to “realism” was a bit over the top sometimes, but it also showed how far we've come with video games as a form of entertainment. Even though I've finished the main story, I still have the itch to jump back on my horse and ride the plains, looking for bounties and trouble. Here's hoping we get some DLC so I can expand my already long adventures.
