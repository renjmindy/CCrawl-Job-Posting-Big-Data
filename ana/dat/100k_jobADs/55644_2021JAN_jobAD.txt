 I received this email the other day for a "par time job offer". Aside from the obvious typo in the subject line, this job offer has other red flags. 
 
 
 Companies don't bulk mail potential employees. They post jobs on job sites or newspapers. 
 
 
 _" JOB TYPE. To receive payment from our international clients/Customers on commission bases of 15% commission from any money you will receive from our customers," _ This is another fake check scam. The checks you'd receive would not be from clients, but fake checks. You'd then be asked to send the money (minus the 15% commission) to someone else by certified check. Eventually, your back would notify you that the check you cashed was fake and you'd be responsible for money you sent…by cashiers check so you can't stop it… to the scammers. 
 
 
 Legitimate companies don't need to use your personal bank account to do business. If they can accept a cashier's check from you, they can accept them directly from their clients. 
 
 
 NEVER, EVER RESPOND TO JOBS THAT INVOLVE HELPING BUSINESSES "RECEIVE" PAYMENTS.  Not only can this scam cost you thousands of dollars, but it could land you in jail for passing a fake a check.

 Thank you for exposing the truth about online scams in your site! It really helps. The best precaution is to never give away your personal details to people you do not trust. Always be very careful with the people you trust too.
