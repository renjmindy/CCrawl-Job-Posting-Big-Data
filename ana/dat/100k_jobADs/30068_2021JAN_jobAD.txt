 I'm looking for a driven Logistics Operations Manager with a specific understanding of HMRC legislation working within the Air, Sea & Road Freight industries who can be part of the new structure to drive the business forward. The company is an undisputed high performing global freight business based in Heathrow. 
 I have an exciting opportunity to join a global freight provider as they look to create a centre of excellence by recruiting a highly capable Operations Manager to focus HMRC guidelines in improving air, sea and road operations. Based near Heathrow airport, the successful candidate will earn a competitive salary up to £48,000, plus benefits and bonus. 
 The successful candidate will have an autonomous role working closely with the Head of Operations onsite, you will take full responsibility for P&L onsite and financial performance of the area. You will be tasked with ensuring the highest levels of performance throughout your team whilst displaying up to date knowledge of all HRMC legislation. The position is needed due to the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit implications and what that will mean from an HMRC perspective, you will need to adapt as these changes become more apparent working collaboratively with your client base to ensure no undue delays. You will lead your team and make process improvements where applicable, training and mentoring the staff as you push forwards. 
 The site is a freight forwarding environment where the key responsibilities will be to engage with all internal stakeholders from top to bottom. Driving a "team" culture where everyone is pulling in the same direction will be vital as you look to streamline and improve upon current systems whilst driving performance excellence. You will need to be a good man manager as engaging with your team on all levels will be critical to your success. 
 Previous experience of working within a freight forwarding distribution environment is paramount, you will strive to ensure that all transport activities are executed in accordance with customer service level agreements. You will monitor that all suppliers are operating at the required levels of performance and that HMRC compliance is of the highest order. 
 This is a great opportunity for the right candidate who wishes to work for one of the biggest names in the freight forwarding market; success in this role will facilitate your development within the business. 
 For more information please apply to the role or contact Phil Birch on 07970 211517.
