 About Request Network 
 The Request Network Foundation promotes the adoption of Blockchain by providing a framework which allows everyone to develop their own financial solutions based on this technology. The Foundation creates and sustains an ecosystem of builders, the so called “Request Network Hub”, that empowers everyone to disrupt the way we do business tomorrow. 
 Request is a decentralized network that allows anyone to request a payment (a Request Invoice) for which the recipient can pay in a secure way. All of the information is stored in a decentralized authentic ledger. This results in cheaper, easier, and more secure payments, and it allows for a wide range of automation possibilities. To become the backbone of world trade, Request integrates a general ledger (in the accounting sense of the term), which is: 
 
 Universal because it is designed to support 100% of global transactions, regardless of currency, legislation or language. Request is built to last. 
 Smart because unlike an existing standard accounting book, Request is at the origin of the exchanges and integrates a computerized trade code, as well as the management of a multitude of payment terms. 
 
 Request can be seen as a layer on top of Ethereum, which allows requests for payments that satisfy a legal framework.It is also possible to see currencies as tools to complete Request transactions. In this sense, Request is more global than any currency. 
 Please see  https://request.network  for further details. 
 About the role 
 At Request, our mission is to interconnect isolated financial systems to create more efficient and inclusive economies. We are accomplishing this by building a completely decentralized and open network for transaction requests.

 Our core technology is an open-source protocol. It allows records of transactions to be easily stored and accessed. This shared network gives financial systems a shared language to communicate. 
 On top of this, we are building Request Invoicing, the biggest crypto-friendly invoicing application. Request users benefit from our unique payment detection solution: the reconciliation of invoices payments is 100% automated. CFOs, accountants and auditors have the clearest financial view they could imagine. 
 Our upcoming priorities may include: integration of more blockchains and currencies, improvement of the payers’ UX with different kinds of wallets (for example: multisig wallets), decentralized escrow system embedded within the smart invoice, fiat on-ramps & off-ramps, mobile app etc.
