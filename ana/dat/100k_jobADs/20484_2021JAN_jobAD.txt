 Gleeson Finance are delighted to be working in partnership with this growing client, to recruit a Group Financial Accountant, based at their Head Office in Kidderminster. This is a real opportunity to be a member of the central finance team for a fast-growing, international, listed Group. We are looking for ambitious people who want to be part of a business that is constantly evolving, and an all round commercial accountant. 
 You will gain enormous hands-on experience of all operational finance matters that impact a large but highly entrepreneurial business, covering a wide-range of areas, principally focused on but not limited to: 
 
 Consolidation of results from the UK and overseas operating divisions around the group 
 Monthly and statutory reporting, for various stakeholders 
 Working with the finance teams made up of various FDs across the international group 
 Supplying the Board with data for key commercial / strategic purposes 
 Producing ad-hoc analyses 
 Helping with improving the in house reporting system 
 Working with various external advisors on other financial reporting-related projects 
 Working with newly-acquired businesses to help on-board them with Group processes 
 
 You will be a qualified accountant, from either practice or industry, ideally newly qualified or up to 2 years post qualified. You will have some consolidation experience and be pragmatic and committed to helping the team achieve the Group's objectives. 
 In return, you will receive a salary of up to £45,000 with bonus, 25 days holiday (+8), pension, private health care, free on site parking and an opportunity for a fast track career with this dynamic business.
