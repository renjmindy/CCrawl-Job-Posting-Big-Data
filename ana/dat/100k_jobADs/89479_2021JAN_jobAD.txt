 The future of work is a hybrid remote model. This allows employees greater flexibility in their personal lives but provides enough social interaction to ensure company cohesion. This creates a new class of challenges for businesses who want to optimise their hyrbid working model. 
 Schej is an early stage B2B SaaS start up that provides office management solutions for hybrid remote workforces. Our first product, Schej Time, is almost complete and we're now beginning to focus on developing traction. 
 We're looking for an ambitious Head of Marketing co-founder who can work part-time to help with our content strategy, SEO, media appearances and online advertising. Expectations that this would be 10 hours per week. 
 This would be a remote role with flexible working hours (you choose) but ideally you are in or close to London as this is where the other members of the team are. 
 Initially this is an equity only role but once we have completed our fundraising round (Q2) we would then pay salaries and expect you to increase your working hours and eventually work for Schej full-time.
