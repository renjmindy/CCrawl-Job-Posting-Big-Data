 Thanks for Sticking Around! 
 On  February 24, 2019  By  This Beautiful Life In  army ,  Career ,  love ,  marriage ,  Military ,  relationships 23 Comments 
 My husband being home has been the biggest blessing. Its been 8 months since his deployment and I'm still just as grateful for to be in his arms as the day he got home. He teases me that I'm more needy/clingy/cuddlely (is that even a word?!) than I was when we were dating and I blame …

 Holiday Anxiety 
 On  November 5, 2018November 5, 2018  By  This Beautiful Life In  army ,  Career ,  lifestyle ,  long distance ,  love ,  marriage ,  Military ,  relationships 12 Comments 
 While most are excited for the holidays, I'm scared. Last year we were so sure that we would get to spend them together. Surely they wouldn't deploy him just 8 weeks after PCS'ing... Thats what we thought at least. He ended up receiving ordered Thanksgiving week and deployed the following week. It was just a …

 This week makes one year. One year since we left Georgia. One year since we last saw our families. One year since we moved into this little house of our. One year since we made Texas home. This is the first time we have had the pleasure of calling somewhere home for more than a …

 Reintegration

 What a month it has been! I know I have been absent these past few weeks but we have been having the most incredible time together. From drive in movie theaters to whole in the wall restaurants, we are having so much fun exploring our "new" state and town. With that said, as wonderful as …

 Can You Hear Me Now?! 
 On  June 29, 2018  By  This Beautiful Life In  Adventure ,  army ,  Career ,  Family ,  lifestyle ,  long distance ,  love ,  marriage ,  Military ,  relationships 17 Comments 
 I swear we sounded like a dang Verizon commercial. We must have asked that questions at least 30 times and said "Babe?... BABE? Are you still there? Wait, what?!" another 30 times. We were able to get in a few sentences and a little conversation but not much before the call would either drop, go …

 Weight Off My Shoulders 
 On  June 12, 2018  By  This Beautiful Life In  Adventure ,  army ,  Career ,  Family ,  lifestyle ,  long distance ,  love ,  marriage ,  Military ,  relationships 21 Comments 
 I am so thankful for understanding managers. One of my biggest stressors these last few weeks has been how to request time off for the home coming. The military can be unpredictable and I have learned not to trust anything until it actually happens. For the longest time we had one date... then it changed, …

 Personal Banker In Training 
 On  May 13, 2018  By  This Beautiful Life In  Adventure ,  Career ,  Family ,  finances ,  relationships 16 Comments 
 I am happy to report that I completed my first week of training and... I like it! It's a huge learning curve. Absolutely everything is new. The newness is a bit overwhelming but I know with time I will become more confident and comfortable. There are so many procedures for giving out money, exchanging money …

 On  May 5, 2018May 6, 2018  By  This Beautiful Life In  army ,  Career ,  Family ,  lifestyle ,  long distance ,  love ,  marriage ,  Military ,  relationships ,  Uncategorized 64 Comments 
 I can not tell you how many times I have been told "Your life doesn't need to stop just because your husband is away at training/deployed.". And while that may be true for your career, social and other parts of life, only recently have I discovered that unfortunately its not true for every part of …

 Take the Risk 
 On  April 26, 2018  By  This Beautiful Life In  Career ,  Family ,  finances ,  lifestyle ,  Uncategorized 43 Comments 
 I did it. I went for it, accepted the new job, put my two week notice in at Golds Gym and begin working at the bank next month! The fear is still there. I'm terrified! I'm not sure that this new job will be the perfect fit for me. I have no idea if I …

 Should I Leap? 
 On  April 22, 2018  By  This Beautiful Life In  Adventure ,  Career ,  Family ,  finances ,  marriage ,  Uncategorized 25 Comments 
 This PCS, has been tough as far as my career goes. Before we moved, I had a great job, with amazing pay and perfect hours. I was prepared for it to take a few weeks, even a few months to find a job like that at our new duty station but I never imagined that …
