 I am curious about the difference between them. I come across one question about them. 
The economic recession has meant that job _ is a rare thing. 
A. security B. safety C. protection D. secureness 
I think, the answer here should be "secureness", the reason why I think so is that "secure" has the meaning of "obtain, get possession of". But the key here is "security". I cannot understand it owing to the reason, I assume, that if you choose "security" you can also opt "safety". It seems reasonable, isn't it?

 No, it's (A) security. The expression "job security" is a set phrase referring to the likelihood of someone keeping their job with a low chance of becoming unemployed. I don't think a native speaker would say "job secureness": it sounds very odd to me.

 It's a pity that the exercise book contains no more details execept this simple sentence and the blank.
