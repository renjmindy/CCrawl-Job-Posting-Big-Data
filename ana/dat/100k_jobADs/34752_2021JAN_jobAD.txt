 What if there was a way to effectively communicate your message to every single employee you have? 
 Merrick Rosenberg, author of The Chameleon: Life-Changing Wisdom for Anyone Who Has a Personality or Knows Someone Who Does as well as Taking Flight!: Master the DISC Styles to Transform Your Career, Your Relationships…Your Life, joins Adam and Naresh to discuss the different types of people we experience in the workplace (and in life & politics), and how we can truly reach them with our words. It's not as simple as simply talking the way YOU think is most effective, it's talking in a way your listener will hear you. 
 Merrick is a keynote speaker and thought leader on personality styles and team development. He co-founded Team Builders Plus in 1991 and Take Flight Learning in 2012.
