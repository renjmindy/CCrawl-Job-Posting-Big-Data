 DWP tells grieving mother to find job 3 days after death of young child: "grief is not an illness"

 Posted  on Twitter  by an NHS GP: 
 Dear @DWP , 
 When a distraught mother has lost her young daughter, please can you tell me why you wont accept "grief reaction" as a sick note diagnosis? Telling a grieving mum this is not an illness is extremely insensitive. You have also wasted NHS time. 
 3 days after her daughter died, she got call from the DWP saying did she realise she couldn 't claim Attendance Allowance anymore & had to sign on Job Seekers. Mother panicked & found herself at a job interview the following week - at which she broke down in tears. 
 She phoned me in a state on way home from the interview. I was horrified they had put her through this. I 'm so upset by it all. 
 Welcome to Theresa May 's Britain.

 Hi 
 I think there may be some confusion over the benefits here. Attendance Allowance is for disabled pensioners I think. Might need some further checking.

 Grief is not an illness my god, I lost 7 friends and family over a 5wk period while working two jobs as a single mum … the pressure of holding not only two jobs, but running a house, a home, looking after kids, looking after the garden and trying to keep hold of any sort of social life already had me at breaking point - and when they all died I physically collapsed when I walked into work after the 6th death.. it felt like an elastic band snapped inside me, I physically felt it go !! … my legs gave way beneath me and the tears started streaming - and they never stopped … The REAL PHYSICAL UNRELENTING PAIN was and still is if I loose control of my continual daily fight to hold my emotions in check worse than childbirth .. so bad I wouldnt even wish this pain on my worst enemy . I've suffered with severe depression ever since .. grief is the worst and most painful emotion anyone can suffer from

 Dear Finella Taylor, most likely the poor mother was in reciept of attendance allowance to allow her to look after the child, who subsequently passed away, we have no way of knowing as there is not enough information .

 Apologies for my previous comment, and agree that there has been some confusion over the type of benefits being claimed. 
My bad, Very tired, and over reacted 
 I suspect the mother received a bog standard letter 
I hope that she will be at least be able to not have to look for work for a while until she feels well enough to cope with the rigours of job hunting

 I don't understand this. I was the full time carer for my mother who had Vascular dementia. She died on the 26/8/18. I still recieved income support and carers allowance for eight weeks after her death. I've been submitting a sick paper from my doctor from the time those benefits stopped,I'm covered by my latest sick paper till the 4th of Feb. Maybe it's because I live in South Wales and the rules are somehow different here. I go to the job centre every month and I have not been pressured to find a job yet,they've been very understanding. I hope things change for this young woman.

 Puzzled by this. Of course the DWP frequently makes mistakes and shows a singular lack of compassion, but if you are getting Carers Allowance then this continues for 8 weeks after the cared for person dies. I'm not sure about Income Support. The benefit concerned won't be Attendance Allowance as that is the disability benefit for people of pension age.

 Is this true? Attendance Allowance is for over 65s, If this is true please fact check the benefit and amend before others start questioning the veracity of the article. 
 [Dear James. This may be a bit complicated, so please concentrate. On the internet there are things called 'links'. You move your 'cursor' over some 'text' and it changes from a little 'arrow' to a little 'hand'. Then when that happens, you can 'click' on the 'link' and - like magic! - you are taken to another website. Now. Look more closely at the article. You'll notice the words 'on twitter' are underlined and are a different colour. This means they are a 'link'. So now, hover your little arrow 'cursor' over those words and 'click' when it changes to a little hand. There you'll see the NHS GP who posted this information. Ask her. Thank you.]- TOM

 It also sickens me to think this is how people like myself, my daughter who is epileptic, with major surgeries on both her shoulders as they dislocate, are treated..to tell amputee's they are no longer disabled, what a joke! Do they honestly think this is right, their limbs do NOT GROW BACK, for goodness sake.. 
I honestly do not understand this government at all, the so good'ers who think they are putting this country in a good place..wish they would honestly get their heads out of the sand, this country is worse off, people are taking their own life's because they cannot cope without any money, .NHS is no better off, the way of living is worse off over this Universal Crap! 
As long as the MP's pockets are lined, they don't have to worry. 
STOP sending money to the third world ,(sorry) but it's their government who are reeping the money not the people, their countries are so corrupt. 
Stop giving money to the immigrants that come over without nothing, because they know this country will give hand outs. 
While our own homeless , families are having to go to food banks, first time this has ever happened,…instead of getting better , it is certainly getting worse, I am really worried for my own family, my granddaughter who has special needs , for their future.

 If she is old enough to claim Attendance Allowance she would be too old to be expected to find work. Sorry for pointing out the inaccuracy, but these things do need to be accurate.

 Nothing new here I'm afraid. Had all benefits stopped and a false accusation of fraud levelled at me in 2010, weeks after losing my son to suicide. 
Sadly it's human nature. You're vulnerable, likely in no fit state to defend yourself, you are seen as an easy target by the mean types who go for civil service type jobs.

 This must have been Carers Allowance and Income support - there's transitional regs to say that on the death of the cared-for person there should be an eight week run-on, as stated by someone above. But, dealing with the DWP is often about pointing out the rules to them, they don't always know them, and staff having a bad day make the wrong choices too.  http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/2020/regulation/2

 Attendance Allowance is claimed by the person who has a disability and because the carer was in receipt of State pension are unable to claim Carers Allowance. Maybe the lady whose child died could have been of retirement age as the “child’s” age wasn’t stated

DWP are so heart less and I'm shocked that they are behaving in this manner . As far as I'm concerned they should apologise 100%.

 I’m gonna call fake news. This would never happen 3 days after a child’s death. Attendance allowance is only for pensioners. Seems to be a bit of scaremongering. In time, a person may be spoken to about returning to some form of work, as the benefit system is about what you can do, not what you can’t but definitely not after 3 days. Bereavement and grief have always been questioned on medical certificates as they are not classed as an illness. A doctor needs to say something like “anxiety and depression caused by bereavement”. Bereavement and grief are situations. Medical assessors need to know the impact of the situation. 
I’m 
Not for a second saying that I support this government and how they run departments within DWP, but this just doesn’t happen.

 I think this needs checking, attendance allowance is a benefit an elderly person can claim. Career allowance can be claimed if you are looking after someone adult or child that needs extra care. You can claim career allowance for 6 weeks after the person dies or goes into residential care. After a death of a child, a doctor would issue a sick paper and the mother could have claimed sickness benefits
