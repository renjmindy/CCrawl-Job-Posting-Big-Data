 Here are some of the top trends in recruiting that promise to change the way organizations identify, engage, and ultimately hire top talent in the coming years and how employers can adapt procedures to these changes to ensure a successful recruiting program. 
 There are three major trends in how companies connect with top talent in today’s challenging recruiting landscape. These include: 
 1. Increasing role of the employer brand 
 Two-thirds of HR leaders surveyed say their organization is more focused on employer branding than they were 5 years ago. Additionally, more than half (57%) attribute their company’s ability to attract top talent to a strong brand. Not only does an enhanced employer brand help draw in qualified candidates, but it can also lead to improved corporate awareness and reputation. 
 Moreover, the top three reasons why organizations succeed in attracting top talent were found to be a pronounced reputation and brand, strong industry appeal, and competitive salary and benefits. These factors further drive the need for companies to continually enhance their brand to stand out as an employer of choice. 
 2. Culture and aptitude fit win over skills 
 Company culture has an enormous impact on attracting and retaining top talent, which explains why many of the companies noted for their unique, enjoyable work cultures are also some of the most profitable. Investing in the creation and continuous improvement of a differentiated company culture should be a priority for C-suite executives. At the same time, aptitude, personality, and cultural fit will emerge as key factors in the talent selection process, favored over traditional hiring factors, such as specific qualifications. 
 Focusing on aptitude and attitude to do the job, and investing in learning and development to build needed skills and qualifications, will enable organizations to expand their talent pool and enhance their culture. 
 3. The rise of online talent communities 
 More employers will build robust talent communities throughout 2015 to engage with a larger talent pool. This will provide access to passive and active candidates, past applicants, current and former employees, and other members who help employers find the talent they’re looking for. 
 Overall, the company found that 50% of employers plan to invest in social media and online community management in 2015 to better tap this source of talent.

 Thoughts of IT, engineering, and computer science don’t normally conjure up images of people who are the life of the party. Or even those who enjoy exchanging pleasantries. But, these unicorns of the tech world—those that have technical talent  and  people skills—do actually exist. You just have to know how and where to find them. 
 What 's in a name? 
 The first instinct of any recruiter or HR professional is to look at the title. This can be a grave misstep because titles are often misleading. Titles like Field Engineer or Systems Administrator may not imply the full extent of the candidate’s experience working with others. While technical-sounding, candidates with these titles actually have to work alongside staff and clients on a consistent basis. What’s a good way to make sure that you fully understand someone’s communication ability through his or her resume? 
 See if they have any consulting experience. The word “consultant” doesn’t have to be in the title, either. For example, an applicant with experience in website coding design probably has had to communicate with clients and staff to deliver the desired result. Producing designs that are aligned with a company’s brand requires a high-level understanding of what a company’s culture is all about. Awareness of company culture is usually an indicator of someone who can appreciate the value of a company’s people. 
 So they can talk the talk, but can they walk the walk? 
 Once you’ve found someone who appears to have all the skills on paper, how do you know if they can walk the walk? A technical skills screen is probably the first thing that comes to mind, but it isn’t the only thing you should be doing. 
 It’s crucial to make the most out of group interviews and phone screens. Seeing how people interact with others is a good way to gauge overall social skills, so is asking questions about what they do and don’t like about their current or previous positions. And then there’s the all-important question: would I enjoy going to dinner with this person? If they seem like someone you’d enjoy spending time with outside of the office, it’s likely they’ll be just as interesting to work with. 
 Hold the phone, social media is important too? 
 The phone screen doesn’t have to be brutally difficult. It can actually be quite the opposite. In addition to observing how easy they are to communicate with over the phone, asking people simple, casual questions—such as what they like to do outside of work or what they’re truly passionate about—can give insight into their like or dislike of social interaction. 
 You can tell a lot from a phone call, but you can tell a whole lot more about an applicant by their presence on social media and in their professional networks. People who have robust, but appropriate, social media profiles and who regularly attend networking events are usually people who enjoy the company of others. 
 However, even the most people-oriented of tech talent may not be on LinkedIn. The reason is simple—tech talent is in high demand and many of the people with those skillsets don’t want to be bombarded by recruiters. If you do find a qualified applicant through LinkedIn with a strong profile and a few solid recommendations, chances are you’ve got someone with potential. 
 You may have found the perfect candidate, now what? 
 So you’ve found the illusory candidate with a mix of tech talent and people skills online. How do you woo them? By being personal. All too often, recruiters search strictly by title without doing any research about the individual before reaching out. Even though you may be searching for people with hard technical skills, they probably are driven by more than just a paycheck. 
 Take time to figure out what someone’s previous work experience is and allude to it in your initial email. Be sincere when you ask them about what they want their job to look like, or what their passions are. A smart recruiter and HR professional shouldn’t just be looking for a technical skills fit—they should also be looking for potential employees who are looking to advance their careers over the long run. 
 Searching for candidates with both the right technical skills and a big personality may seem like a lost cause. However, the more effort that’s put in to get to know the person behind the credentials, the more satisfied the person—and the company—is going to be with the job fit.

 Of course we all are looking for the best fit for the job, right? But how often do you think about their ability to handle your particular management style? This is often an area that managers overlook when asking the candidates questions during an interview. 
 Here are some questions that you should consider asking in your interviews to help assess the candidate’s adaptability to different management styles: 
 
 Describe the perfect manager. 
 Based on your past employment, who would you choose as the best manager you’ve had the opportunity to work for? Why were they good? 
 Based on your past employment, who would you choose as your least favorite manager? Why were they your least favorite? How did you adapt? 
 How do you handle conflict with your managers? Disagreements? How do you resolve issues? 
 
 By asking questions similar to the ones listed above, you’ll find a greater understanding of how the candidate feels about different management styles. If you find that you’re for the most part the ideal manager described by the candidate then you can have confidence that you’ll work great together should you decide to hire them for the position. On the other hand, if you really like the candidate but worry about being similar to the manager that was their least favorite then you can consider ways to adapt to ensure a smooth and successful relationship if you decide to hire them on. 
 You shouldn’t base your hiring decision on whether or not they can or cannot handle your management style but rather use these questions to help prepare yourself for building and maintaining successful relationships with new hires.

 5 Ways To Get Noticed By Recruiters

 1. Show   No Fear 
 “The best way to stand out to recruiters is to stand up to them” says Joseph Terach, CEO at career services firm. “Don't let them overly influence your preferences for work responsibilities, arrangements or salary based on their reported understanding of the employer." 
 Your job search is your own, even if they are helping. Terach recommends listening to the insider information recruiters can provide, “but keep in mind that recruiters have split allegiances and are salespeople at the end of the day.” 
 2. Communicate 
 Knowing what you want is a great way to stand out, Terach says. You’re not just looking for “a job”; you can tell the recruiter the job you want. 
 “If you come to the table with a crisp professional pitch, not only will your recruiter know exactly what it is you want (and don't want), but they will also be more able to discuss you and communicate your background to potential employers,” he says. “It will save you time because you won't be getting calls for interviews that don't interest you; and when your recruiter finds the right job for you (one that fits your pitch), he/she will have zero reservations to get behind your candidacy 100 percent.” 
 3. Be Honest 
 You of course want to put your best foot forward when dealing with recruiters, but it’s important to be candid about any shortcomings you have as well, says Heather Neisen, talent coordinator. “Self-awareness and honesty are extremely important. Be proud to share your strengths and passions, but also be able to openly discuss areas where you need — or better yet, want — to improve.” 
 Many candidates don’t realize being honest about their shortcomings actually offers a chance to shine, she says. “Admit them and offer ways you’re trying to overcome them. Few things are worse than a candidate who believes they have nothing left to learn.” 
 4. Highlight Your Tenure 
 If you’ve got staying power, promote it, says Andy Barberio, account executive at Fortus Healthcare Resources. “I always look at tenure — tenure is really big. When you find somebody that’s been with an organization for a long time or has helped build it up, they are marketable. Switching jobs every year or year and a half over a five to six year period doesn’t present the best on a resume.” 
 5. Let Yourself Shine 
 Barberio says you can’t teach personality, but if you have it, flaunt it. “Personality and fit and being able to relate to staff is tough,” but it’s what recruiters are looking for. Some positions just require “a special kind of person,” he explains, and recruiters will try to get a feel for who you are when they are meeting with you. Being yourself will help the recruiter find the best fit for you and your skills.

 By the way, if you end up in that cartoonish position of having 2,000 online applicants, you probably need to find some knockout requirements to get that pile smaller. Or, you could, for example, decide to look only at the first 250. Whatever system you choose, be sure that it doesn’t discriminate. 
 Your Time Is Precious 
 You need a system to keep all those unqualified candidates’ credentials off your desk and off your computer desktop as well. 
 Clear and Detailed Postings 
 First of all, in all your advertising and posting, be clear about the requirements and be specific about the job. Unqualified candidates will self-select out, and the best candidates will be intrigued by the close match between what you seek and what they offer. 
 Complete and Consistent Data 
 In many cases, you’re stuck with a variety of application material such as application forms filled out by walk-ins, e-mail notes, letters from various people recommending candidates, and letters or résumés with little information in them. 
 Before you review, try to get as much information as possible in the same format. You can’t compare one candidate who submitted a brief letter to one who sent in a detailed résumé and filled out an application. If information is too brief, ask the person to apply online with full information or request a more-detailed résumé. 
 Review Efficiently 
 Next, be careful to review credentials efficiently. In the winnowing process, you want to spend as little time as possible with the obvious rejects—and more time on serious candidates.

 Recruiting today has gotten complex. People want to apply online or use their phones. And services abound to help you with the process. A good place to start is to ask what applicants are looking for and what they are seeing when the check out your company. 
 What You Say About Yourself 
 First, check out what you are saying about yourself. General company website. Does it make the company attractive? Would a candidate say, I’d be proud to work there? Recruiting website. Does it give an attractive picture of what it is like to work at your company? (This is often done by video tours and videos of workers.) Is it easy to navigate? Easy to apply? Social media. Is your organization active on social media? 
 **What Others Say About You ** 
 Look at social media again—what is being said about your organization? And check out websites that collect comments from workers and former workers. Sometimes these sites are “trash” sites. Still, it is interesting to know what is being said. If candidates are going to be reading these comments, you want to be ready to offer your version of the story. 
 For example, maybe the comments say that your workplace is an “evil sweatshop.” You might be ready to say, “It’s true that we work hard here; we have a highly motivated team of achievers that is working on exciting, cutting-edge development. But we also play hard, and we reward our workers very well and you set your own hours and take time off whenever you want. If you’re looking for a workplace where the work is repetitive, slow, and deliberate, we’re probably not the place for you.” 
 **What Are Candidates Looking For? ** 
 First of all, recognize that they will look. Surveys suggest that many jobseekers are researching potential employers by visiting their websites. So, as mentioned, make sure your site is well-designed and friendly. 
 You know your audience, I hope, and what they are looking for in a company and in a job, and you know what you offer. Find a way to marry those two things. 
 And then there’s the issue of applying online. Today’s applicant wants it to be easy, and reports suggest that many will give up if the site is too confusing or doesn’t work the way they want it to. 
 Visit your site. Try to apply. Try it from your home computer, your tablet, and your phone. The exercise could be revealing. 
 Apply-by-Phone 
 Apply-by-phone is in the news these days, with some calling it a “must-have” feature. One advantage is that many people who don’t have easy access to a computer do have access to the Internet on their phones. But most phone applications systems are clumsy and difficult. Further, it’s often hard to upload a résumé from a phone. This is an issue you will have to face if you think you’re losing good applicants over it. 
 There are many recruiting avenues for you to use and most experts recommend trying several—you’ll soon see which ones work for you. And, as an aside, from a legal standpoint, you want to use several avenues to avoid charges of discrimination. 
 But there are still certain basics that need to be in place no matter what system you use to attract and evaluate candidates.

 With the prevalence of social media, employers are finding more and more uses for it in the workplace, for example, as a component of the talent management process. More and more organizations are taking advantage of the growing reach of social networking. 
 Here are some ways to incorporate social media into the hiring process. It can be used to: 
 
 Search for candidates, even finding potential new hires who are not actively job-seeking. 
 Conduct background checks, if done carefully. 
 Receive online applications. 
 Post job openings or increase the reach of existing job posts. 
 Present a consistent and complete company image to potential job seekers. 
 
 Which of the various social media platforms is best for each of these activities? The answer is:  it depends. 
 Each of the various social media platforms, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Pinterest, and Google+, can be used for each of the points above. Which site to target depends on your organization and the ideal candidate for the role. This is because the demographics of the typical user vary for each site. Research the demographics of each site and compare that to your ideal candidate to see which might be a good fit for your organization to target. Don’t be afraid to research some of the smaller social media sites as well.

 Job seekers often start their search by identifying the type of job they want before looking for companies that offer relevant positions. But what if you have your eye on a specific company you want to work for, and you're willing to do whatever it takes to become a part of that organization? 
 Perhaps you've always considered the company to be interesting and innovative and you admire the company's culture. Or maybe the company tops a best places to work list, making it a desirable place to start or grow a career. Sometimes it might be driven by knowing people who work at the company and wanting to work alongside familiar faces. 
 Whatever the reason, pursuing a particular company versus a specific job comes with its challenges. But if you're committed to working somewhere, there are ways to up your chances of getting hired there. 
 Here 's how: 
 Make sure you know why you want to work there 
 You may have convinced yourself that you're destined to work at a specific company, but make sure you can back up your reasoning. 
 Do your homework 
 If you know without a doubt this is the company for you, fill your brain with as much knowledge about the company as possible. 
 Tap your network of contacts 
One of the best ways to get your foot in the door at a company you admire is to seek out people in your professional network with a connection to the organization. 
 Build a relationship with HR 
While the human resources department is sometimes hard to reach, do what you can to connect with someone on the team directly. If you've already communicated with someone in your network who has an "in" at the company, use that person to introduce you to the right HR contact. 
 Make your interest known before a job opens up 
Part of the reason why it's good to establish a relationship with HR and other influencers within the company is to let them know of your interest before a position becomes available.

 Critical Hiring Mistakes

 by Stephen Bruce 
 Selecting the right people is so basic to success, yet many managers do it poorly, due to either haste or ignorance. Here are critical mistakes for recruiters and hiring managers to avoid. 
 1. Failing to Clarify What You Are Looking For 
 Everyone’s in a hurry to fill a vacant position. But filling a job fast will never make up for hiring the wrong person. What’s a few weeks compared to a mismatch between person and job? That’s going to result in poor productivity, low morale (not just for the person but also for coworker), a termination, and often, a lawsuit. 
 ‘Just replace Sally.’ 
 Think about filling the job, not replacing the person. Whenever there’s an opening, it’s a chance to take a look at the organization chart and the strategy just to be sure that hiring someone to the old job description is still a wise idea. Perhaps anticipated changes suggest that someone with a different skill set would be a better fit for the long term. 
 2. Failure to Cast a Wide Net 
 It seems simple to hire today—hit one of the big job boards and go at it. But most experts recommend using more than one source for candidates. It will improve the candidate pool and support diversity initiatives. 
 3. Interviewing Carelessly, Poorly, Inconsistently, or Illegally 
 Carelessly . Careless interviewing, that is, being unprepared or casual or both, results in not gathering enough information to make a reasonable hiring decision. In addition, that lack of interest will leave the best candidates unimpressed. 
 Poorly . Poor interviewing techniques again lead to not getting the information you need to make a good selection. For example, asking yes/no questions, fails to probe deeper than the first (often prepared) answer the candidate gives. 
 Inconsistently . It’s best to conduct similar interviews and evaluations with all the candidates. Naturally, they won’t be the same word for word, but you should cover the same ground. If you cover past accomplishments with one candidate, future vision with another, and local sports with a third, how will you make a rational choice? 
 Illegally . All interviewers need to be trained to avoid questions or comments that can appear to be discriminatory, for example, questions about gender, race, national origin, religion, and age. The courts will assume that you asked the questions because you needed that information to make your decision. That leaves you wide open for a discrimination lawsuit based on asking the question.
