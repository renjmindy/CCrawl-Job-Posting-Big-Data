 The Emerging Ledgers team is responsible for enabling DAML code to run on various underlying platforms 
 Role overview 
 Opportunity 
 The Emerging Ledgers team is responsible for enabling DAML code to run on various underlying platforms including blockchains, distributed ledgers, and databases. We thereby enable developers using the DAML SDK (daml.com) to run their DAML applications on platforms of their choice, as appropriate for their use-cases. For this purpose, we maintain a generic DAML integration kit, contribute code to the DAML runtime maintained by our sister team, and work closely with our platform partners to enable their ledgers to support DAML in production. 
 As a software engineer on the Emerging Ledgers team you have the unique opportunity to work on novel and security-critical technology while also tackling the production challenges of such a system for demanding use cases in fields such as healthcare and the financial industry. This particular role will have you working in a small team creating a new product for Digital Asset from the ground up and affords a significant amount of autonomy for a candidate ready to take on a greenfield project. 
 Key Responsibilities 
 
 Working on Digital Assetâ€™s Scala code bases, writing Scala code. 
 Lead the development of DAML for SQL â€“ our enterprise-grade tool to enable DAML applications to run on centralized databases 
 Supporting our platform partners with architecture and implementation work. 
 Testing and improving our technology to satisfy the production requirements. 
 Following a collaborative approach that fosters, embraces, and insists upon diverse perspectives. We are a team where everyone pulls more than their weight, where everyone matters and all opinions are valuable. 
 
 Key Criteria 
 
 Experienced polyglot software engineer as demonstrated by either your open-source libraries or commercial experience. 
 Writes good, clean and effective code preferentially in Scala. 
 Existing experience with developing and deploying production systems is useful. 
 Bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science or a related discipline; or equivalent demonstrable experience.

 As we grow our team, we will maintain the dynamic, collaborative and pragmatic way of working that has grounded our efforts from the beginning. If you seek to develop solutions others have yet to contemplate, this opportunity may be right for you!
