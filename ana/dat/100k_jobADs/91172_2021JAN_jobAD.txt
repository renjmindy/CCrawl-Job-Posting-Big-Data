  Career Transition: Europe to America  
 Work It Daily 
 March 04, 2010 
 Dear Experts, I recently received my U.S. green card am living/working in Denmark. I am looking for an IT job in Los Angeles, California. My idea is to find a job before I move to America. I've tried different approaches to get a job, such as: - Applying for positions directly via websites like Monster, Craigslist and CareerBuilder - Networking via LinkedIn - Applying for positions advertised on Twitter So far, I haven't received any replies or interview opportunities. I must emphasize I have 5 years of working experience in IT and I find my CV and current/past career quite successful. Recently I had no problems changing a job in Europe - the fact is I started a new job in January this year, just before being granted a green card. All this got me into thinking: How come I haven't gotten any job offers/interviews yet in America? And the best answer I found so far is: It comes only through personal networking! So my question is simple: What would you recommend I do in order to get job offers in LA?  Here is how our CAREEREALISM-Approved Experts answered this question on Twitter:   Q#451  Personal networking is important in your situation given the distance you will move. Keeping working your contacts. (@ gradversity )  Q#451  Try to get someone in IT at a co to meet you for coffee to give you scoop on what it takes to get hired. (@ jtodonnell )  Q#451  Join expat networking groups. Members might be able to offer you support and advisement based on personal experience. (@ CareerCoachPro )  Q#451  Networking is the way to go. You might consider working directly with a 3rd party recruiter to represent you. (@ blogging4jobs )  Q#451  Find someone in LA who you can offer FREE help to remotely. Then do it. Best way to make a friend. (@ beneubanks )  Our Twitter Advice Project (T.A.P.) is no longer an active campaign. To find an answer to the above question, please use the "Search" box in the right-hand column of this website.
