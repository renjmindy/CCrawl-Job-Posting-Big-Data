 Full Time 
 Bloomberg runs on data. It's our business and our product. From the biggest banks to the most elite hedge funds, financial institutions need timely, accurate data to capture opportunities and evaluate risk in fast-moving markets. Enabling clients to access Bloomberg's data and perform custom analytics, the Bloomberg Query Language (BQL) and Analytics platform is at the forefront of innovation for our business. 
 Our team is responsible for developing a low-latency analytics platform and screening engine. We are also working to define and build a domain-specific query language (BQL). This language allows users to express complex analytics and quantitative models for execution on the platform. 
 As a member of the continuous integration and developer experience team, you will ensure our codebase remains stable and help increase the efficiency and development of new features. You will automate code and project management to reduce duplication of efforts and minimize time between implementation and deployment. 
 We 'll trust you to: 
 
 Design and develop CI tooling based around Jenkins, Maven, Docker, and Github 
 Influence and contribute to the design of firm wide CI/CD systems 
 Collaborate with a team of highly motivated software engineers to drive an innovative culture 
 Think critically about the "bigger picture", take calculated risks and come up with creative solutions 
 
 You 'll need to have: 
 
 Advanced Python coding skills with a focus on scripting and extensible frameworks 
 5+ years of experience with Continuous Integration and Deployment, as well as IOC frameworks like Spring 
 Experience integrating Jenkins with existing in-house workflows 
 Experience with Persistence Frameworks, AVRO/JSON and RESTful services 
 Experience with scalable build and deployment systems (ability to build scalable systems for large computes on big data) 
 
 We 'd love to see: 
 
 Experience with Docker, Artifactory, and JIRA 
 Experience working in a test-driven development and agile environment 
 Experience developing tools for increased operational scale 
 Experience with integrating Jenkins with existing in-house workflows 
 
 If this sounds like you, please apply! We'll be in touch if we think you're a match. 
 Bloomberg is an equal opportunities employer, and we value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.
