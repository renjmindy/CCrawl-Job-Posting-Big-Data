  How To Match Your Skills To A Job With Your Resume  
 Jessica Holbrook Hernandez 
 Aaron Sanborn 
 January 26, 2021 
   
 Have you ever wanted to apply for a job you realized did not completely match your skill set? 
 It's happened to all of us at some point in our careers, especially when attempting to switch fields. The good news is, winning a position when not fully qualified is completely possible. By using your resume as a tool, you can show just how great of a candidate you are. 
 Here are some ways to set up your job search, and potential career change, for success. 
 Read The Job Posting Carefully 
 The first step in ensuring you  add skills to your resume  that align with those required by a specific position is to read the job posting carefully. Doing so not only shows you exactly what's required of the job but it also helps you examine your own skills that match.  For instance, if a company mentions in its job posting that it is looking for an administrative assistant with strong organizational skills and experience setting up meetings for company executives, you know you need a certain take-charge attitude to ensure the office is organized. Now, you can include your own organizational skills—and even show proof that you've interacted with top executives in the past. 
 Think From The Hiring Manager's Perspective 
 Thinking from the perspective of a hiring manager is not always easy to do, but it is possible—and necessary—if you want to add the right information to your resume. To start, read the job posting and even take a few moments to  learn more about the company  itself through its website or other sources.  Then, think about what you would hope to see on someone's resume if they set it on your desk. Would you expect to receive resumes from people who only have experience as models or background dancers? No. You would want to see how their experience relates to the position they're applying for. Using this perspective while writing can help you create a resume that will get you hired. 
 Show You Can Learn New Skills 
 It's important to showcase your ability to learn new skills by highlighting previous training, along with a willingness to take on new projects. One way to do this is by listing any training courses you've taken, certifications you've received, programs you're proficient in, and any other details that prove your ability to hit the ground running.  Some people who have acquired their dream jobs did not have all of the experience needed to claim the position—but they did submit a resume that helped them score an interview where they could then prove that they were right for the job. Don't let a lack of skills stop you either. Take the  steps necessary to make your skills a perfect match  for the job you deserve. Now that you know how to match your skills to a job, which position will you land? Is your job search ready for the challenges ahead? Work It Daily wants to help!

  What's The #1 Thing That Holds Professionals Back & How Can They Fix It?  
 Jenna Arcand 
 Amy Hinderer 
 Dr. Jan Urbahn 
 January 20, 2021 
   
 As a professional, you might not know just how much potential you have in your career. There are many factors that can impact your career success, but one of the most significant ones is underestimating our own skills and abilities. 
 What's holding us back from achieving success in our careers? And how can we fix it?  Here's some advice from executives who've learned what it takes to succeed at a high level. 
 ​Amy Hinderer, Business Management & Operations Executive 
 One's belief system is the key to whether professionals will succeed or lag behind their peers. But wait, what is a belief? A belief is a feeling of certainty or conviction about what something means. One's belief system has been unconsciously formed based on their interactions and associations experienced, whether it was in childhood, education, relationships, or at work. These experiences are etched into one's mind and often a challenge to change because it anchored the feeling of a pleasure or a pain it caused.   So I ask, are your beliefs holding you back? Odds are the answer is yes. Let's dive in and show some common examples of limiting beliefs that may resonate with you and how you can change them.   Belief: I do not have the skills or talent required.  – Life requires humans to continue learning and progress. Taking risks and getting outside one's comfort zone is scary and uncomfortable. Take a moment now and map out the areas you want to improve. Establish and commit to your goals, measure the results, and modify as needed. Remember this, you will never know what you are truly capable of unless you try.    Belief: I can do this on my own.  – How many of you know someone who is so certain they are the only ones that can perform the work required? Leaders often hold onto too much. It's hard for them to let it go. This is an opportune time for the person to challenge their belief system. They can choose to view the delegation as a way of providing another individual with a developmental opportunity and perhaps even become a mentor in the process.   Belief: Successful people are simply just lucky.  – Successful people do share some common traits, but it certainly is not luck. It is about being persistent, committed, resilient, and passionate. Think about Stephen King, Vera Wang, J.K. Rowling, or Colonel Sanders. These individuals could have quit when things got bad, yet they continued and persevered to become legends in their fields. We have the power to shift our beliefs to ones that empower us to be our best.   Belief: I have to wait for the right time.  – We can always give ourselves the excuse, "It's not the right time," to jump into whatever it is that we want to do. Do not let the fear of failure keep you on the sidelines. If you never start, you will never succeed.   As Tony Robbins has said,  " The only thing that keeps you from getting what you want is the story you keep telling yourself." Amy Hinderer  is a business management & operations executive with 18+ years of experience in global enterprise and start-up businesses. She has managed teams ranging in size from 10 up through ~35K supporting revenues between $2M - $9B. 
 ​Dr. Jan Urbahn, Automotive & Shared Mobility Executive 
 My observation is that the leading cause for professionals not moving forward with their career is the discontinuation of learning. Two major trends have been developing over the past 20-30 years: We have moved to a society dominated by information, and innovation cycles keep accelerating. It is estimated that the entire amount of innovation of the 20th century was packed into the first 20 years of the 21st century, and the next innovation cycle might be even faster. In order to move forward in an accelerating environment, continued learning is highly important. These following strategies might help you learn new things.   Take an Online Course There are plenty of online courses available covering any possible professional topic. I've made good experience with Udemy.com and Coursera.com, and there are plenty of other platforms available with many free courses. In addition, many universities are offering some of their courses for free online. Furthermore, websites like Brilliant.com offer great daily challenges to keep the mind moving.   Culture Scan   Do a regular culture scan, at least once every three months. For example, I like to go to a bookstore which has a wide variety of print magazines. Take 15 minutes to scan the shelves. Reading the headlines on the covers will give you a good overview of current trends and developments in your field of work and in the broader economy. If you can't find a physical bookstore nearby, websites from Barnes & Noble and Amazon.com have a selection of current magazines to browse through.   Read Something Unfamiliar   Consider reading something about a topic that is completely outside of your area of expertise. You may purchase a magazine you have never read before or consider going to your local library and getting a book about something new. Reading about unfamiliar topics will cause your brain to create new synapses, which eventually will bring you to new insights and ideas. For example, I remember buying a magazine about knitting, which is not an activity I have ever engaged in. The magazine was full of fascinating patterns to knit, encoded in a specific language. The coding format triggered new ideas I could later implement in a project. Dr. Jan Urbahn  is an automotive executive with 20+ years of experience in product development, safety engineering, and operations in automotive and shared mobility business. He helped launch 3 new businesses with up to 1,500 shared cars in fleet size. His most recent leadership position is within the shared mobility space, where he helped develop a new EV battery and guided the coronavirus response. 
 We hope this advice helps you realize your potential. Stop holding yourself back in your career! You're more capable than you think you are.  Ready to take your executive presence to the next level?  Check out Work It Daily's  Executive Presence Program  today!

  How To Manage Career Uncertainty  
 Aaron Sanborn 
 January 13, 2021 
   
 In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic greatly disrupted the economy and resulted in layoffs at multiple businesses. 
 It also served as a reminder to professionals that your employment status can change in an instant. 
 No matter how established and comfortable you are in your career, uncertainty can always be around the corner and there are things that you can do to prepare yourself for these situations. 
 Be Honest With Yourself 
 From time to time, it's important to ask yourself,  "Am I happy with my career?" The answer to this question tells you whether you should be building a  career plan  strategy for your current profession, or if you need to shift gears and get yourself ready for a career change. Every job is temporary! People change, businesses change, and obviously the economy is always changing. The key is to have a good idea of the direction that you want to go in if you find yourself dealing with a job loss. Do you want to continue down a similar career path, or make a change? 
 Make Yourself An Indispensable Employee 
 One of the most consistent pieces of advice that we give at Work It Daily is the importance of showing value at your job. Employees who consistently find ways to save or make the company money have a way of making  themselves indispensable . But beyond that, showing a strong work ethic and commitment to your job are all traits that employers value, and they help you build a reputation as an exceptional employee. Even if the worst-case scenario occurred and you still lost your job at some point, all of these accomplishments and traits can be used to market yourself when you're hunting for a new job. Be sure to use numbers and statistics  on your resume to quantify  how you made your previous company more efficient and profitable, and keep in touch with former colleagues and supervisors who can vouch for you as a good employee. Making yourself indispensable may not work 100% of the time, but it's never a wasted effort because your accomplishments will speak for your work ethic and character, and will help you land on your feet. 
 Embrace Career Growth 
 It's important to be a lifelong learner, both in your professional and personal life. Professionally, while it's important to be in the present and focus on your core job responsibilities, it's also important to keep an eye towards the future and think about ways your role can expand. You sometimes hear stories about managers asking job candidates where they want to be in 10 years and the candidate answering  "I want your job!"  While this isn't the ideal way to answer this interview question, it's good to have that type of ambition. Career growth is a multi-step process that starts with excelling at your primary position and then taking on additional responsibilities. From there, it's about gaining the confidence to bring ideas to the table about expanding your role and then seeking  opportunities for promotion . Those who are willing to grow their careers position themselves well in times of uncertainty. But once again, if you do happen to lose your job, this willingness to learn will serve you well on the job search, and impress potential employers. Always be on the lookout for  ways to upskill . 
 Make A Career Change 
 If you're no longer happy with your career, chances are you aren't doing everything you need to do to grow it, and your job may be vulnerable in times of uncertainty. Making a change will not only be a good move for your own happiness, but it's also the better long-term career move. Sometimes career uncertainty and job loss is the push many professionals need to make a change.  Career change  isn't an easy process, but if you take some time to learn and commit to the process, it can be very rewarding. The good news is Work It Daily can help!
