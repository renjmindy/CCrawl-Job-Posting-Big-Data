 Hackney hardest place to find job in country 
 Posted on  June 15, 2010  |  2 Comments 
 The day before Hackney Unemployed Workers took action with the Defend Welfare network, it was revealed that Hackney is the hardest place to find a job in the country. Figures released by the TUC state that there are 24 claimants for every job advertised in the borough. Read the  TUC's press release. 
 Read Hackney Unemployed Workers'  "What to cut and what to do" . We tried to present it to the Department for Work and Pensions but their security wouldn't let us through the door!
