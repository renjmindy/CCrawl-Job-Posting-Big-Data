 The 5 Stages Of Career Grief (Which One Are You In?) 
     J.T. O'Donnell 
 and 
     Work It Daily 
 April 06, 2020 
 Grief doesn't just occur when we lose a loved one. If you were laid off due to COVID-19 or its financial repercussions, then you could be grieving for your career. 
 
 "Just like anything, any kind of loss, we will get through this, and there's an opportunity to come out stronger on the other side. But, the only way we're able to do that as effectively and as quickly as possible is if we understand all the stages we need to go through to get there" 
 Career grief is a very real and emotional process that no one should have to go through alone. In this episode, J.T. O'Donnell will walk you through the 5 stages of career grief, and what you can do to overcome them.
