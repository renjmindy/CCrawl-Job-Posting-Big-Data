 Are you interested in finding typing, data entry and other virtual assistant jobs from home, but are worried the field is crowded with more experienced VAs? While it's true there are a lot of virtual support workers out there, the need for help continues to grow, giving you opportunities to break into the field. 
 The other good news is that you  don't necessarily need to have experience  as a virtual assistant, office support staff, or administrative assistant to get a virtual assistant job from home. That doesn't mean you won't be expected to have certain skills, but you don't necessarily have to have those skills in a virtual support capacity. 
 Below you'll find information on what virtual assistants do, plus a list of over 50 places you can find virtual assistant jobs from home, including transcription and data entry. 
 What do Virtual Assistants do? 
 The tasks of a virtual assistant, sometimes called a VA, can vary greatly depending on the needs and the field of the company doing the hiring. In general, virtual assistants do any of the following: 
 
 Manage email 
 Manage contacts 
 Manage schedules and calendar 
 Transcription 
 Data entry 
 Answer phone calls 
 Social media management 
 Book events 
 Make reservations 
 Create documents (letters, spreadsheets etc) 
 Invoicing 
 Bookkeeping 
 Payroll 
 
 In fact, here you can get a FREE l ist of over 150 things you can do as a virtual assistant . 
 Note, that some virtual assistants specialize in an industry, such as a  real estate virtual assistant , while others might specialize in a specific skill, such as social media or Pinterest virtual assistant. 
 Along with basic clerical and office skills, a virtual assistant should also have the following skills: 
 
 Quick learner 
 Organized 
 Good communication 
 Writing (clear, plus good grammar and spelling) 
 Ability to multitask 
 Work without a lot of direction 
 Meet deadlines 
 Be discreet 
 Be professional 
 Work under pressure 
 
 What do you need to be a virtual assistant? 
 It goes without saying that you should have a computer and high speed internet for virtual assistant jobs from home. Other equipment or software you might need include: 
 
 Landline phone 
 Mobile phone 
 Phone/ computer headset 
 Microsoft Office products (Word, Excel) 
 Knowledge of online tools such as Google Drive, Google Docs, Slack, Dropbox, etc 
 
 What do Virtual Assistants Get Paid 
 The highest paid virtual assistants have their own businesses. The next highest paid virtual assistants have specialized knowledge or experience. For example, a real estate assistant that has a license is paid more than a general VA. Or a VA with good tech skills is often paid more than a VA that does only clerical work. 
 As a beginning VA, you can expect to be paid anywhere from $8 to $50 per hour depending on the skills required and the industry you work in. 
 Companies that Hire Entry Level Virtual Assistants 
 Most of these companies hire virtual assistants that have little to no experience as a VA. Remember though, you may still be required to have skills and experience in the tasks they want you to perform. 
 The list includes companies that hire general virtual support, and below that are companies that hire for specific tasks such as transcription or data entry.
