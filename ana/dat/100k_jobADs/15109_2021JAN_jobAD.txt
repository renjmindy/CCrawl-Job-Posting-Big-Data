 Well, if you were booked for your first gig, then you must really prepare for it. You must exert an effort to be extra so that there's a possibility that you will be booked once again, and other future clients might see something in you. In the first place, we should always do our best, isn't it? My friend is also a freelance talent in different events were booked severe times just because He did his best, we should also do the same thing and be professional all the time!
