 Sometimes you have to just take the initiative and motivate yourself because your biggest supporter may just be waiting on you to make the first move. 
 
 We all have some things that we can improve upon, and if you think you don't, you are only fooling yourself. Life is a continuous learning process, and that means if there is life, we need to keep on learning. To put it differently, understanding oneself and understanding others can make our life much easier and can also, give you the edge over those who are seeking the same position as you. Soft skills, what do you mean? Well, soft skills according to the online dictionary mean "personal attributes that enable someone to interact effectively and harmoniously with other people." 
 Remember this; there are others who are working to get the same promotion or position that you are working towards. 
 Let's look at soft skills that you may want to think about honing: 
 
 Communication skills - you don't have to be the best orator or writer, but you have to be able to express yourself so that others can understand what you are trying to get across to them. 
 Adaptability - things are going to change and those who can adapt to the change the best will have a smoother transition and at the same time eliminate the possibility of being frustrated. 
 Teamwork - being able to work with others can make a difficult task much easier and also, enhance creativity and build positive relationships. 
 Emotional Intelligence - is having the capability to recognize your own emotions and the emotions of others. Being able to identify the different emotions in yourself and others will help with how you respond to how someone may react to you. 
 Networking - to network with others is a great way to increase one's knowledge. As an individual, we are not going to see all the opportunity that is out there and at times what is available may be seen by someone in your network or seen by you that can benefit others. It's all about upward mobility. 
 Strong work ethic - if you work for others or yourself having a strong work ethic is vital to achieving one's goals. 
 Problem-solving - is the ability to use your creativity, reasoning, experience and information to find solutions to problems. Being able to work under pressure, to solve daily problems is always a plus being that you work for others or yourself. 
 Taking initiative - it is always great to do what you are supposed to do without someone have to tell you constantly what to do. Doing so can increase your value to your organization and can also give you the edge among your peers. 
 Decision making - don't be the one still wondering what to do. Decision making is critical to your advancement and when we are faced different situations we have to decide what action is best to take. 
 Inspiring and motivating others - you can be the influence to those around you, and you can do that through what you do and what you say. 
 Critical Thinking - in today's world we are bombarded with so much and therefore, it is imperative that we have the ability to engage in reflective thinking and independent thinking. In fact, to be a critical thinker is more than having the knowledge but to know how to apply the knowledge that he or she knows. 
 Dealing with difficult people - understanding others will make it easier to deal with others who are difficult, and you are going to have a difficult person to deal with if you haven't already. 
 Entrepreneurial thinking - things have changed and even if you are working for someone you still want to be able to think of new ways to do what you are already doing. Besides, no matter what you are doing you should have a mindset of achieving greatness. 
 
 If you haven 't already, start looking at challenges with a new eye. See those challenges as opportunities. 
 IT IS POSSIBLE TO GO BEYOND LIMITATIONS. IT MAY NOT BE EASY, BUT IT IS POSSIBLE.
