 Austin Ruse's C-Fam Conjobbery 
 First, I recommend anyone who has a sense of humour visit the (anti-gay and anti-women's rights) C-Fam site and read through  Austin Ruse's bio . It's just hilarious. One gets the impression he wrote it while jerking off to his own image in a mirror. Puff doesn't begin to describe it. His accomplishments include _" Mr. Ruse is a Knight in the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, a Knight in the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre." _but of course, he's neither in the military nor an equestrian. Those are basically just two religious (Catholic) groups. The "Military Order" gets to use a corner of a fort in Malta for its charity activities. 
 It goes on to say: (he)  is a founding member of the Diplomatic Society of St. Gabriel.-   yes  , that certainly seems to be a pattern in Mr. Ruse's credentials; he gives them to himself. Just as in founding C-Fam, making himself the president and then using that  do-it-yourself-pseudo-prestige  to make himself seem important. Never has  Smart Draw's print-your-own-diploma software  gotten so much use as in Mr. Ruse's little C-fam office. 
 But wait because the worse is yet to come- and I find this one surprising because it doesn't take a genius to figure it out. C-Fam and Ruse himself have made a monumental hoopla about being  UN recognized . 
 
 Everything they say implies they are somehow members or employed by the UN itself. They often refer to their "special consultative status" as if that means world leaders and ambassadors  consult with them  before making decisions. Let me make this simple:  Any  NGO can  register with the UN  to defend their interests (  thousands on top of thousands on top of thousands have done it  ),  and they can even do it online . And when I say  any,  I mean that C-Fam's  special UN recognition  is the same special UN recognition that's enjoyed by the Nadi District Youth Group in Fiji. They don't even have a website, but here's their Facebook page: 
 
 In fact the UN website even says "Most applications get approved within two or three sessions of the Committee." So much for the hoopla and  very crafty backstory of alleged victimization .  So no, neither Netanyahu nor the Israeli ambassador actually questioned Ruse about his opposition to abortion in all cases.  UN "recognition" is an entirely meaningless bullsh*t line. 
 What's clear is we do have to ask ourselves if Ruse is a Walter Mitty character with pathological delusions of grandeur- or if he's a run of the mill con-artist who uses a whole lot of hype and deception to ensure C-Fam continues raking in donations by faking their importance and impact. Perhaps it's a bit of each.

 Great investigative work, Pinkâ€¦ But I'm a little confused. Who's Ruse, and what's he to you?

 He's an anti-women's rights and anti-gay campaigner. He's also an ardent supporter of Katy Faust aka askthebigot ðŸ˜‰

 Figured something like that. Now, please excuse me while I go and preside over a full-faculty meeting of the Immaculate Order of Golden Axolotls, of which I am, naturally, President.

 He's anti-woman, anti-gay, he prints his own credentials (credentials he gave himself), he likes to pretend the UN consults with him before making big decisions, and maybe a couple of nutjobs donate a few bucks to him (he needs the money for printer ink so he can print out some new credentials for himself, give himself that promotion he's been wanting. So what if he belongs to a few archaic Catholic groups nobody's ever heard of, that and $7.50 gets him a cafe latte. The Roman Catholic Church has officially cut ties with Opus Dei, what does that tell you, that Opus Dei is such a bunch of crazy bastards, the Catholic Church cannot be seen to do business with them. And this Mr. Ruse is involved with fringe groups that make Opus Dei look mainstream.

 What frustrates me the most about people like this is how transparent their claims are. Yet somehow, some way, one can find religious people who are willing to fight tooth and nail to support people like this. People like that get my goat and ride it around the damn room.

 We found out through NOM (The National Organization for Marriage) that groups like this typically have one benefactor who supports them. These small Hate Orgs, if they loose their one benefactor are done with. Well at least Austin married well, his wife at least brings home a steady paycheck working for another Hate Group The Family Research Council. His wife gave a talk to the main assembly at the last World Congress of Families Conference in Salt Lake City. It was at the end of October if I recall. I watched the video WCF posted and half listened and actually his wife looks pretty damned good, I wonder what she see in him? 
 It's kinda interesting how Austin Ruse seems to have hooked up with Robert Oscar Lopez, they seemed pretty cozy on Twitter, one looser attracted to another looser, LOL! 
 Cara wrote that the Roman Catholic Church has cut ties with Opus Dei, I didn't now that. I'll have to go google it. Well Austin Ruse can go sit in tiny Malta and hold hands with Cardinal Burke, that is where Pope Francis demoted right wing caustic Burke to, banished him to Malta. The little nation of Malta is actually quite progressive, they have recently passed laws ending discriminatory laws against sexual minorities. Poor poor Austin, he doesn't even have Malta to cling to any more, they are now Pro-gay, ha-ha.

 The man's jargon sounds innocuous enough to the 'ordinary Joe' and for those who are undecided on the issue of abortion he sounds as though he really cares. All the Bullsh*t ranks he's given himself ( I have more) are designed to impress this person and lead them to think the cause is valid and totally church backed. It sounds like the UN recognise the cause too and back it. Of course you must donate in that case to ensure the cause doesn't fail. 
It's just as well you're no 'Ordinary Joe' or I'd be exhorting you to get the cheque book out. 
The man is evil but just plausible enough to get away with it unless you keep enlightening us all as to who he really is. 
Well done on the investigations. 
Hugs

 All over the placeâ€¦ 
Started a new job role in October which goes together with another degree program in Mental Health. Lots of trainings, meetings, Uni, family on top, plus the wonders of being over 50 ðŸ™‚ 
But, been following you, and am really thrilled to see how great you've progressed. 
Great to hear from you!
