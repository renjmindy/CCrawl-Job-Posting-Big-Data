 Bold Faith 
 I have a job. Jesus has given it to me. I must be faithful in fulfilling it. I can't shirk it off and leave it to others. 
 Jesus, my Master, expects me to live up to it. Jesus has given me the Holy Spirit to give me the power to do what God wants when I don't have capacity within my self. I am a new creation because of what Jesus has accomplished. 
 As an "older man", Paul makes it clear that my job is to: 
 
 Live a life of temperance (moderation or self-restraint) 
 Live with dignity 
 Show wisdom 
 Demonstrate healthy faith 
 Model love 
 Endure until the end 
 
 Others will judge me based on my behavior. I don't want them to look down on God's message. I can't afford to be found a hypocrite. 
 
 Your job is to speak out on the things that make for solid doctrine. Guide older men into lives of temperance, dignity, and wisdom, into healthy faith, love, and endurance. Guide older women into lives of reverence so they end up as neither gossips nor drunks, but models of goodness. By looking at them, the younger women will know how to love their husbands and children, be virtuous and pure, keep a good house, be good wives. We don’t want anyone looking down on God’s Message because of their behavior. Also, guide the young men to live disciplined lives.

 This post reminds me of something that just happened here in my city. A state trooper was fired for "proselytizing" on the job. He pulled a woman over for speeding, gave her a warning, and asked her if she had been saved. Then he invited her to his church. The woman filed a complaint. He was interviewed by the news and he stated that God told him to do that. He said he felt he had to listen to God.

 What is worry? Do we know God? Do we know how God works?

 What is the proper response to God as His covenant people? Is it faithfulness?

 Will we regret it if we make a run for God? 
 What is the proper response to God as His covenant people? Is it faithfulness? 
 What is worry? Do we know God? Do we know how God works? 
 Do we understand love? Do we really get it? 
 What price did Jesus pay to redeem us? 
 Are there examples where Jesus didn't judge? 
 Can a gaabout gossip be trusted? Will someone of integrity violate a confidence? 
 Will we be resurrected? 
 Are we slaves or servants? What does Jesus think? 
 Why does Jesus ask so many questions? What are your answers?
