 I'm a nurse with 2yrs and 3months of experience in a reputable hospital with 100-300 bed capacity. I saw your post regarding a caregiver job in Canada. 
I think it would serve as a good opportunity for me to be in CANADA. I also handled elderly and pediatric cases and can work effectively even under pressure. I'm also good in communicating and very much fluent in English. I'm hoping for your favorable response.Thank you and God bless.

 good day!!! 
I wish to work in Canada too, as everyone here. Just want to ask mam/sir, if is it really needed to apply for the programs that it's gov't made for foreign workers, such as the Federal skilled worker program, Provincial Nomination program and the likes? or, can we work in Canada thru online direct application to employers situated in Canada without even applying for those said programs? 
is there a chance to be considered as immigrant already when hired by the employers without the application for the programs? 
thank you!!! hoping for your response…

 Hi , i am 27 f, from Pakistan. I am experienced for three years in the childcare and nursery of a children hospital. I am a pharmacist by profession (i.e with a medical background). I want to resettle in Canada with a Caregiver job and proceed my career there. 
I am responsible, caring, fluent English speaker-writer, a good driver, and an individual who cares for personal and home hygiene at most. I would take care of my international travel expense if offered an appropriate opportunity.
