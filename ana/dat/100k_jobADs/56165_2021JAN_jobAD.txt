 Caregiving Jobs Abroad 
 Posted on  May 29, 2009  by  caregiver 
 A caregiving jobs employment agency that provides Canadian families and establishments with well trained and reliable caregivers, nannies, home companions, and personal support worker is in need of qualified caregiving jobs applicants for various clients in Canada. The said caregiving agency also serves as an employment resource for local and international workers. The caregiving jobs agency’s main mission is to help caregiving jobs applicants find new opportunities in Canada, a country which promotes just, safe and prosperous society, and become active participants in the rapid growth of Canada’s economy. 
 Canada is the only country that offers a caregiving jobs applicant the opportunity to gain a permanent resident status after two years of continuous caregiver work.

 A high school diploma equivalent to the Canadian secondary education diploma or at least 72 units in university level. 
 A one year paid experience as a caregiver or in a field related to nursing/nursing aide, physical therapy, midwifery, and teaching. 
 Six months full-time caregiver training with a certified caregiver training center. 
 Fluent in either English or French. 
 
 To the chosen candidates for caregiving jobs, their employers will be Canadian families who have children, elderly, or physically challenged family members who are qualified to hire and have complied with the requirements of HRDC and CIC.
