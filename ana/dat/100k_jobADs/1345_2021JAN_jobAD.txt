 Sterling Book Launch For Mark Rothenberg's The Brand Story In All Its Glory 
   THE BRAND STORY IN ALL ITS GLORY 
 Available in paperback and kindle 
 TAMPA, FLORIDA —  Sterling Publishing Group  announces the release of  THE BRAND STORY by MARK ROTHENBERG - a must have for every business owner or entrepreneur. He educates the reader that they must develop a sound branding and marketing strategy to get noticed and stay in the game. 
 Mark Rothenberg, a 25 year veteran in advertising, marketing and branding, knows the importance of the BIG IDEA. He's the owner of  Marksmanship Services  in Houston, TX and in his book he explains clearly the importance of a brand and how to convey your message properly. Your Brand Story is the blueprint that begins the process and becomes the foundation upon which everything else rests, relies upon and, ultimately, succeeds. This is true regardless of the size of the business or the amount of money spent on its promotion. Since nobody is in business to offer the exact same things as their competitors, your unique Brand Story will celebrate those aspects — both tangible and intangible – revealing the “thing” that separates you from them. Discovering your brand story is a process … 
 1. Build Brand Equity, Clarity and Credibility Through THE INTERVIEW 
 2. Discover the Facts and Bring Everything Together In The Blueprint 
 3. Establish a Marketing Position – Make YOU the Focal-Point & Expert 
 4. Reveal New Position, Theme, Slogan - Your USP & The BIG IDEA 
 5. Tell  THE BRAND STORY IN ALL ITS GLORY 
 **Available In Paperback  & ** Kindle   at Amazon
