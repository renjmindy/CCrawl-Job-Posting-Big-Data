 I am Joy Mason, 31 years old single, seeking for a caregiving job. I believe I have the capacity to be trained easily. I am confident I have a good command of the ENglish language in both writing and speaking which makes me fit in an English-speaking environment such as the UK. I believe that the communication needs in my desired field of work will be met. I have a relevant experience in caregiving in a nursing home in the UK for technically two years. Right now, I am in the Philippines seeking for a an employer abroad. Should you consider my inquiry, I would be willing to undergo the rest of the process my application would require. Thanks a lot!
