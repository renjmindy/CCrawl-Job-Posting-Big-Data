 I am one who loves going for a swim or cycle. But these past days I've done so much exercise or at least I think so. Yesterday I walked from school to home to Beccas to town then got the bus home ðŸ˜€ and then to Rachaels. That's quite a lot. Then today I've cycled from home to Tesco to a little shop to Asda to home. And I today I still have to cycle around the place to deliver Avon. On top of this, I have also been doing my own work outs but I really don't think I'm going to manege that today. I sure couldn't yesterday. But this cycle was worth it. I came home with a tomato and herb swirly (which Peta introduced me to and I just had a craving for it), a fashion magazine and pear and apple green tea. 
 I'm not into the gossip magazines but I do love looking at all the clothes so that is why "Company" is a good magazine for me ðŸ˜€ 
I must say "normal" Green Tea does taste planty so I thought I'd give the flavored ones a go and low and behold.. I like it:-) I am strange.. it has to have milk in it. I don't understand tea without milk. Its weird. 
I'm going to have my swirly for lunch:-) then do Avon and have dinner with my favorite people tonight:-)

 Today I met my brother who is back from University until September. I took a cycle to my Dads and found Timmy still in bed (no surprise) and then we cycled to my friends house to deliver Avon and went back to my mum's house and tought Timmy the cup song. It was SO funny! Timmy was welcomed by some of our friends to eat Tapas. It was yummy!! Here are some pictures:

 Every year, I go to Germany. In some ways it is good and some ways bad. It's good to see family and friends and to do all the holiday stuff but it's bad because apart from Australia in the Summer about 5/6 years ago we never really went on any other main holidays. There are SO SO many places I would love to visit! Now, I have two places that I have only been once that I would love to return to. They are Paris and Australia. Although I wouldn't want to live in these places I would like to go to Paris for longer because when I went it was when I was about 10 or 11, with the school, with teachers, you know.. it's not the best when you go with school at 10 because you don't get a lot of freedom. You can't just walk out the Hotel room and take a stroll to town or go up the Eiffel Tower yourself:D But I am so thankful that I got to go because I loved it so much! So, I would like to return there and I would also like to return to Australia. My cousins live there and apart from one of them who came to Scotland when he was younger I have only met them once. The two girls are the same age as me and I feel that I don't talk to them as much as I should. My uncle said we can come any time. I really want to go there again ðŸ™‚ Apart from that I have a whole world tour planned:D I hope I do get to do that but it's not going to go anywhere unless I have a proper job, but we'll see:)
