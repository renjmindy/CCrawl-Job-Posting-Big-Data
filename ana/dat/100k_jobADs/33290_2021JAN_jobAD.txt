  Help! I've Lost Hope in My Job Search  
 Work It Daily 
 April 10, 2009 
 Dear Experts, Yesterday, I got up early, put on my best work outfit, packed a stack of personal business cards and copies of my resume in a folder and headed to a state-wide job fair. I was really optimistic that I'd finally meet some potential employers face-to-face. Turns out over 10,000 other people had the same idea as me (no lie, it was on the news last night that they had to shut the event down early and turn people away because they had only expected a max of 5,000 attendees). To make things worse, they had promoted the fact that there were a total of 1,000 jobs open at the event. I left depressed. Where do I go from here? How do you compete with odds like that?
