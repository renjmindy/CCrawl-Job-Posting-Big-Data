 My Top Ten Charlize Theron Movies 
 
 Happy Birthday To Charlize Theron, who turns 43 today. 
 I like Theron but that's only really happened in the last few years or so. I think  Fury Road  probably helped. She kicks ass in that! 
 So here are  My Top Ten Charlize Theron Movies  , _counting down to my favorite (and including everything I 've seen). _As always, these are ranked by how much I like the movie, not her performance: 
 The Rest That I 've Seen: 
 14. The Astronaut's Wife 
13. Reindeer Games (aka Deception) 
12. Mighty Joe (  I don 't actually remember much of this ) 
11.  A Million Ways To Die In The West 
 Top Ten: 
 10. Hancock  (  I don 't actually remember this very well eitherâ€¦ ) 
 9. The Italian Job 
 8. Snow White And The Huntsman 
 7. Atomic Blonde 
 6. Prometheus 
 5. The Devil 's Advocate 
 4. Young Adult 
 3. Tully 
 2. Kubo And The Two Strings 
 1. Mad Max: Fury Road 
 
 Saw But Don 't Remember At All: 
2 Days In The Valley, That Thing You Do!, 15 Minutes
