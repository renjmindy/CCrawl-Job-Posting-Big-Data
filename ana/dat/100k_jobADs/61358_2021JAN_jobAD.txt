  Challenge: Identify Something You LOVE About A Job You Hate  
 Ariella Coombs 
 February 21, 2017 
   
 Today’s Work It Daily Challenge is to  identify something you love about a job you hate.  You don’t just hate your job, you LOATHE it to the core. You dread going into work each day, desperately wishing to be magically transported into a new job that you enjoy. If you’re all out of love for your job, you’re not alone. According to Gallup's  State of the American Workplace  report , 70% of U.S. workers are not engaged at work. That means seven out of 10 workers are bored and/or unhappy in their current role. If that sounds like you, we want you to rethink how you look at your job. Today, your challenge is to identify one thing you love about a job you hate. If you're constantly focusing on how much you hate your job, you're going to fuel your misery. You don't need that extra burden on your back - you've got enough going already! Instead of zoning in on the cons of your job, think about the pros. For example, you may HATE the work you’re doing each day, but the hours work perfectly for you. Or, you CAN’T STAND the stressful nature of your role, but love the people you work with every day. Understanding what you like about your current situation will not only make you feel a little bit better about it, but it will also give you clues on what to look for in your next role. So, you can make your working days suck less AND identify important information on what you want in the long run. That sounds like a win-win to me! What do you love about a job you hate? Why? Tell us!  Related Posts:   Challenge: Give Yourself Decision Deadlines   Challenge: Perform One Random Act Of Kindness Today   Challenge: Wake Up 30 Minutes Earlier
