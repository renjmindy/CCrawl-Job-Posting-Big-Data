 Nervous Kinetic Enegry, 
 spirals out of the life of me. 
 Once had nerves of steel, 
 but now long gone- 
 so damn nervous, tell me this time- 
 what did I do or say wrong? 
 A Lady called me today. 
 Straight out of the big blue. 
 A person-a somebody-I didn't knew. 
 She was asking about a job application I made- 
 nearly seven weeks ago… 
 She was pop-quizzing me, 
 as if I would recall the exact details 
 of the job or company. 
 I have been applying to so many… 
 its easy to lose track 
 its easy to lose track fast. 
 She almost scheduled the interview with me, 
 but something made her pause to say, 
 can i give you a call back??? 
 I am left holding the bag, 
 wondering if I blew the whole thing already, 
 or if she will in fact call back, 
 Gosh, I hope so…I am sitting on pins and needles. 
 Way too much kinetic energy- 
 with no-place, to go. 
 I just know, that by now, 
 its high time, that I finally get a job. 
 I really need a job Now, not yesterday 
 nor tomorrow, but right away 
 in the present moment, 
 in the blink of an eye 
 and the wink of my tongue. 
 I need me some gluing 
 so I do not become 
 completely unraveled- 
 completely undone.
