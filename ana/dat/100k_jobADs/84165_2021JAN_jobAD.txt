  Poll: Would You Quit Your Job On Live TV?  
 Ariella Coombs 
 November 27, 2012 
 A pair of news anchors from a local TV station in Maine recently made a pretty bold career move – they  quit  their jobs on live TV... and they didn’t even tell their boss their career plans beforehand. After working together for six years, Cindy Michaels and Tony Consiglio of ABC News 7 claimed they had good reasons for leaving the station and plan to explore different areas in their field, according to  NBC News . No matter how much you disliked the circumstances of your employment, would you ever quit in this fashion? Do you think it would be a smart move in this economy? Their stunt got quite a bit of media coverage from major news sources such as the  New York Times  , ABC News, Yahoo!, and more. And, despite not knowing the real reasoning behind their leaving, many people applaud the two for their strong stance and wish them the best. But what do you think? Do you think this was a wise decision? Or do you think it could hurt their future  career ? Please take our poll, and tell us what you think in the comment section below!
