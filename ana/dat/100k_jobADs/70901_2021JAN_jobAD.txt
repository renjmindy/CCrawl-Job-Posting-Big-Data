  How To Make A 30-60-90-Day Plan That Gets You The Job Offer  
 Peggy McKee 
 December 21, 2015 
 Even if you know just how amazing a 30-60-90-Day Plan can be for your job interview, you may not know how to find the information you need to include in your plan.  Related:   How to Make a 30-60-90-Day Plan That Gets You the Job Offer  A 30-60-90-Day Plan is an outline for what you will do in the first three months of your new job. The more you can tailor it to the job, the more impressive it will be to the hiring manager in the interview. A well-done plan highlights your knowledge as well as your initiative and critical thinking skills. How can you find the information you need to  create a job-specific 30-60-90-Day Plan ? Your first step will probably always be the company’s  corporate website . This is where you can find out about the company’s size, locations, mission, values, products and services, and more. Next, you should try a  Google search . This can help you find the latest company press releases, as well as news-worthy events. Then, you should turn to  social media . 
 
 LinkedIn 
 LinkedIn is a fantastic source for company information. First of all, the company may very well have their own LinkedIn page with different information that you’ll see on its formal corporate website—but don’t stop there. LinkedIn is a great place to search for the people who work (or have worked) at that company. You can check out their backgrounds or status updates and get a lot of information. You may even find that you can contact some of these people to get the answers you need. Group discussions can be another rich source of information. What are people in the industry saying about this company? Who are their competitors and what are they doing? Maybe you can start your own discussion to find out information. To access group discussions, you must be a member of the group. 
 Twitter 
 If you know the names of people who work for the company you’re interviewing with, you can follow them on Twitter for a few more clues. What are they saying about the company’s current activities or future plans? You may be able to ask questions here, too. 
 Facebook 
 Facebook is similar to LinkedIn in that you may be able to find a company Facebook page or group discussions about the company. But because Facebook itself is focused primarily on social contacts (not business ones), the information you can find here may be different and helpful. 
 If You Want More Direction… 
 Even knowing good places to look for the information you need, it can be difficult to create a good plan on your own. To help you, I’ve developed a perfect 30-60-90-Day Plan Template that includes my coaching for how to create and use your plan in the interview. Talking about the plan in the interview is the most important part of the entire process, and it can be the most difficult if you’ve never used one before.  Find out more about my 30-60-90-Day Action Plan Template and Coaching   , get it and start developing your plan today.
