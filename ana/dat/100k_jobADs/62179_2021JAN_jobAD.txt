 An Update on the Garden. 
 Posted on  June 25, 2014  by   Christine Lucas

 I've not written for a while as: 
 
 
 I don't think anyone reads what I write, so why botherâ€¦ and 
 
 
 I have started a new position in Knowsley, in a day centre for adults with learning difficulties, strokes and degenerative illnesses. It's an admin job supporting a blind receptionist (she even has a guide dog!). So my days are now filled with travelling, (almost 3 hours in total daily), and working 3-5 hours a day, filing, taking phone calls, helping with general admin work. It doesn't seem hard work, not as taxing as the work at the Royal was. The people all seem nice and it's a job. It may only be 18 hours a week, but it's better than the dole! 
 
 
 Every day I come home and wander around our small garden/yard. The Phlox that I have recently bought is starting to flower. The Sedum is 'huge' and is ready to 'pop' at any time and my Salvia is growing again! The Salvia was a prolific grower last year, it had flowers well into October!

 The biggest anticipation for me is the blooming of the Passion Flower. The plant has loads of buds on it and some have now turned purple. I keep looking daily to see if one has flowered but it is keeping me waiting! ðŸ˜€ 
 
 Passion Flower Bud 
 The Cat Mint is still choking up the garden and attracting Bees, but different Bees than the first influx of Bumblebees. I think the picture below shows a Honey Bee enjoying the flowers? 
 
 Honey Bee? 
 There have been new baby birds visiting the feeders too. There have been two baby Blue Tits, (that I could see). Baby Great Tits but I could not see how many, (they make quite a racket begging for food.) There have been up to three baby Sparrows who only come for the food and then once fledged they bugger off! And now the Goldfinch babies with their brown heads are visiting. There must have been about four the other day flying from the feeders with their parents!

 Interview Nerves.

 An extract from 'After Plato'. 
 Charlotte stood buttoning up her blouse as her reflection smiled back at her. She shrugged on a grey jacket that matched her knee length skirt. She remembered the lines in the typed letter that she had received. â€˜We thank you for your application and would like to invite you to an interview.â€™ Charlotte had stood frozen to the spot as she read the letter out to Harry after the postman had delivered it a week ago today. 
 â€˜Do you think they will like me?â€™ Charlotte asked, stroking down the creases of her skirt. 
 â€˜I donâ€™t see why not, you know your playwrights, you would probably be more useful in the press office than the box,â€™ Harry replied. He was sitting on the edge of the bed watching Charlotte get ready for her interview at the local theatre. 
 â€˜Well itâ€™s a start. I could work up the ranks.â€™ 
 â€˜A career woman eh?â€™ Charlotte giggled as Harry grabbed at her, pulling her onto the bed next to him. He felt her body tremble as she lay in his arms. â€˜You donâ€™t have to be nervous. They will adore you, like I do!â€™ 
 â€˜Oh Hal, you are sweet,â€™ Charlotte smiled throwing her arms around his neck and welcoming his soft kisses on her lips, her neck. 
 â€˜Just take deep breaths and think what you are going to say before speaking.â€™ 
 â€˜I will,â€™ Charlotte sighed. â€˜Iâ€™ll think of you when I am in the interview. Your love will carry me through,â€™ she closed her eyes and held Harry close. 
 â€˜Donâ€™t think of me too much or itâ€™ll leave you breathless.â€™ Charlotte smiled and clung to Harry like he was the sustenance that gave her life meaning.

 I know I can be quite a whingeâ€¦ I can be quite self indulgent, though too much for my own good, but I find the new information regarding my position as a support worker at the Royal Liverpool Hospital rather hard to take. ðŸ˜¦ 
 I know the decision is the best for my clientâ€¦ though I have to say the news isn't the best for me! ðŸ˜¦ 
 I will finish work at the Royal Liverpool in November. Meaning I will be jobless over winter, yet again for a second year in a row ðŸ˜¦ (This news isn't the best!) I am so totally gutted!! You may recall I had only just started the position in June/July this year! Four months in a new job is nothing really! ðŸ˜¦ 
 What really upsets me is that I have just settled into the job. I get on really well with my 'boss' and everyone in the Royal seem friendly. 
 During a conversation with Randstad, my boss said my conduct was 'professional' and I try to be. You have a job to do, so you just have to do it!! 
 Though life and circumstances have again thwarted me! ðŸ˜¦ 
 I have long known I will never be rich (nor famous!). Now I know I will never have many friendsâ€¦ I could have made a friend for life with my new boss. ðŸ˜¦ But just working four months and leaving in November, means I have had little time to make the ties of friendship bondâ€¦ 
 Again I find myself jobless and so unhappyâ€¦ Maybe one day soon, I will find happiness? Find a job I can be proud of and be respected for the effort I put into it? Who knows? One just has to plod on, along their life pathâ€¦

 About two weeks ago, I got an email from Randstad about an Access to Work booking for a client who worked in the Royal Liverpool Hospital. The work entailed reading and replying to emails, taking minutes in meetings and general admin duties for their client. I was umming and ahhing about the post for about a week before I sent in my CV. 'What the hell' I thought, 'it'd be better than going on the dole!' 
 Then last Wednesday I had a meeting with the lady in the Trust whom the work was to be for and she seemed nice. You can imagine my surprise when about two hours after the 'interview' I got an email saying I was successful and the lady wanted me to start the following week! 
 I have now had my first three days of work in the Royal and I have thoroughly enjoyed it! It has been diverse, different from the work at the University, but ultimately I still get to meet and work with lots of people. I have been working from 8.30 in the morning 'til 2.30 of an afternoon, so beating the rush hour! I hope that the work continues to keep me occupied over the summer! 
 I am now sitting back and relaxing, enjoying a nice glass of pinot grigio and looking forward to a restful day tomorrow, then wallpapering in the dining room over the weekend, in the final push to get the house 'ship shape' before we move in! 
 During dinner time this evening I noticed six Goldfinch adults at the sunflower heart feeders in the yard and amongst them there was a baby Goldfinch! My first of 2013! I have not been seeing many Goldfinches lately so maybe now they have weaned their young they are starting to show them the feeders? See below for a video of the newcomer!
