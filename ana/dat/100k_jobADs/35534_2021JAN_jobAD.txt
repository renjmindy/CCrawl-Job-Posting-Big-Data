 A way to CLEAR off your debts 
 Sep 11 
 Posted by  NaranTeam 
 Client 
 I came to know about your blog on Aug 15 2013. I saw one switch word combination, “MOVE ON FIND COUNT DIVINE JOB” for getting a job. I started chanting it from Aug 15 itself. 
 Then I sent you a mail with my job problem and you replied with "QUITE CLEAR" Mantra on 25th of Aug 2013. I chanted that too. Yes, I did chanting it, very much all the time. 
 Also, I used to chant Ambika Anaadhi…Mantra before interviews. And then the magic happened. On 28 Aug I got two offers. I have accepted one of the offers and joined the company, just 2 days back. 
 Your guidance has been like Divine guidance for me. I have got this job after 1.5 years. Alas, I could not find your blog before! Thanks to You!! Also, thanks to GOD!!! 
 Now, I am chanting "Lalitham Sridharam, Lalitham Baskaram…" Mantra, since I have debt of 10 Lakhs because of my divorce settlement and unemployment. Please advise if it’s the right mantra to clear off my debt and remain employed. 
 Naran 
 “LALITHAM SRIDHARAM, LALITHAM BASKARAM, LALITHAM SUDARSHANAM” mantra will give you light and source of good income. 
 Lalitham - the one mother who is so compassionate, that she will forgive all my past. Forgiving all the past she allows Sridharam (wealth), to bring money from Baskaram - the provider of wealth, and activates Sudarshnam, to continue the flow of money (after the debts are paid-off). 
 Bow down to the (Lalitham) Mother in reverence and chant the mantra. And when you chant this powerful mantra, chant it with all the trust in divine, without expecting anything in return.

 Making others believe you 
 Oct 12 
 Posted by  NaranTeam 
 Surya 
 I have completed many projects to a quite a few of my clients and many underway. Unfortunately, either they don’t pay the money in full or sometimes they delay the payment and for too long. I don’t know how to fix this situation. 
 Naran 
 You would have told many lies in the past – might be in child-hood days, in college days, or would have cheated your friends and relatives in some way. There might have been situations in which you did not speak the truth. This has corrupted the energy field of your throat chakra, which stands for truth. 
 On the contrary, these days you may be truthful, by all means. However, your clients are not able to comprehend it. Instead of trying to fix your past, let me tell you a solution that will solve your current financial situation. 
 Chant “OM HUM NAMAH” as many times as possible. This will clear the congestion in your throat chakra. Then, your clients will start believing you. 
 I am peaceful at last 
 Khes 
 People on my current job and boss too are so aggressive and full of covert hostility. At some moments, I used to cry or even being nasty too. 
 But, as I am reading your sites all the time I have found mantras. I just want to say that I am European and have difficulties to understand the thing with mantras. Anyhow I gave a try. 
 Guess what! I have chanted OM HUM NAMAHA, while on work. I was peaceful, and even happy, although I was given lower-ranked job that night. 
 Naran 
 "Om hum Namaha" will activate the throat chakra, which stands for truth. When that chakra is activated, you are exhibiting the energy of truth. 
 What is truth? 
 When our actions match our intentions or words Truth (divine order) is exhibited. By chanting Om hum Namaha, a mistaken view of the situation or a person is changed. 
 For Reiki Practitioners: draw the Reiki Symbol “Sei he ki” on the throat. Go on drawing. All untruths will clear off.

 Sashi 
 Just want remedies or any mantras for following:- 
 a) Success in his education (will be doing MS in health care management in USA) 
 b) To get 100%scholarship for his education 
 c) To get a part-time job in his campus only, so that he can save time and money in commuting to all places 
 d) to get a good/divine place to stay, which will be nearer to his campus 
 e) To protect himself from any hurdles, negativity or calamities or problems (from people, circumstances etc.) 
 Naran 
 
 Chant “RED CHESTNUT” as many times as possible, whenever anxiety about your son comes in order to overcome your concern for him. 
 Daily in the morning pray to flowers requesting them to protect him. “WATER VIOLET, WALNUT, SWEET CHESTNUT, STAR OF BETHLEHEM and ROCK ROSE! Be active around him for the next 24 hours and heal him”. Do it once a day. 
 Call Wolf to be beside him always. Just Say, “Wolf” and say whatever you want it do for your son. Wolf is for help. It will do the needful. 
 Pray OM ARUNAAYA NAMAHA (say three times) and request, “Lord Aruna! Protect my son from anything unwanted.” 
 Then “The Mother Bhuvaneshwari, protect the limbs of my son, from all the ten directions”. Do it once. 
 Call St. Michael the arch angel and say “Please keep your blue flaming sword around him and allow divine light and love only to enter”. Do it three times. 
 “Violet flame! Give umbrella protection to my son wherever he is”. Do this prayer once. 
 
 Sashi 
 My son reached US safely, without any customs issues (London /Dallas /St. Louis). Also he got a good apartment for rent and even his roommates are good. 
 I told my son to chant "Find Divine" throughout the journey, and his journey from Mumbai to US was hassle free. 
 Millions thanks to hassle free mantras.

 I lost all hope that I will succeed in Life 
 Aug 1 
 Posted by  NaranTeam 
 “Ambika Anaadhi Nithanaa Ashwaroodaa Aparaajithaa” 
 Hello I want to succeed in my competitive exams and my study. Lost all hope but I started chanting Ambika mantra. Is it really helpful? Thanks 
 Khushi 
 That is why students should study well daily. One always repents and loses hope if he wasted his time during study days. Nothing will help the 11th hour specialists. 
 Anyhow, chant the mantra with full trust. If you pass, commit yourself to become responsible and study well. 
 Naran 
 I am only giving 8 hours to my study and in that I have to manage my husband and household stuffs. I did my engineering but after that I didn’t get a job. I tried so much. But after 5 years I really want to study but competitive exams are too tough for me. Whatever I am doing, it seems that it’s not working. That’s why I asked about this mantra. Thanks for your suggestions 
 Khushi 
 I am really happy to know that you are studying in the midst of your household work. Mantras will work for those who have ambition, trust and perseverance. 
 Affirm, “I pray to Ambika, the one whose origin you cannot trace, and the one who is ever-present since and before the beginning of this world. She only can help me overcome my mind, because I know that one who overpowers and channelizes the mind can win anything and become invincible.” 
 This is the meaning of the mantra. The trust and regular reciting of this mantra will make you reach heights. 
 You can also write 398 in a piece of paper and keep it in front of you while studying. When sleeping keep it under the pillow. On the date of examination keep it with you. Competitive exams will be easier for you. 
Best of luck 
 Naran

 Learn to be Strong, Stable, Patient and Lead a Life of Comfort 
 Dec 17 
 Posted by  NaranTeam 
 If you chant the mantra “Vallabam Gajaananam Yeka Thandham”, while doing the Meru Mudra then it is good for the spinal cord. Refer the blog to check out on Meru Mudra:  http://healbymudra.wordpress.com/2010/05/22/uses-of-meru-mudra/ . 
 It drives out our fear also. If you chant regularly, your back will become solid and strengthened. 
 In day-to-day life, we think, ‘My time has yet to come for my marriage/my job’. Our time is different from divine time. Everything happens only ‘with’ and ‘in’ divine time. This mantra synchronizes your time with divine time. By chanting it, continuously one can get a job or get married. 
 If anybody is impatient, then Vallabam mantra will make him patient. All of us have to chant this mantra as one time or other when we become impatient. 
 Children do not know the value of time. Chanting this mantra will make them to understand the importance of time. 
 BAM (in Vallabam) gives the effect of comfort. To settle down in a job or house this mantra can help. However, we have to chant from the heart. The effect it produces is enormous.

 Peace brings a job! 
 Mar 28 
 Posted by  NaranTeam 
 Mahir left the job he had been working for last 6 years in Arizona, USA. Even though there were fewer jobs around, he had decided to do it, as he was not happy about the job. 
 Initially, he was little bit stressed out. To add to his worries, his father, who was living alone in Mumbai, was not feeling well, due to old age problems and with nobody to support him. 
 Mahir lost his peace of mind. Because of this, he couldn’t focus on his interviews. In the two interviews he attended, even though he was meeting the job requirements, he wasn’t selected, as he didn’t do well in the interviews. 
 He wanted to fix his lack of concentration, which would improve his preparation for the interviews. When he contacted me, I suggested to him various stuff, right from Bach Flower Remedies, Switch Words, to Mantras. 
 Somehow he got hooked to the Lalitham mantras and started chanting, “Lalitham Sridharam Lalitham Baskaram Lalitham Sudarshnam” many times during the day, whether he was working or driving. Naran says, each one of us would be attracted towards a specific mantra or a healing technique, the benefits of which can be found only by that individual. 
 In a matter of few days, Mahir started feeling peaceful. He could focus on his interview preparation – both studying as well do searching on the Internet. 
 Within a couple of weeks of chanting, the company, which rejected him, in the first place, called him once again. The same person who was not confident about Mahir earlier surprisingly interviewed him. 
 Mahir did well. And this time the interviewer gave an excellent feedback about him. Mahir was selected for the job. 
 Now, Mahir wants to listen to the Alpha CD prepared by Naran S. Balakumar, where the Lalitham mantras are played on the foreground. 
 – R Mohan

 Relived from lower back pain 
 Mar 16 
 Posted by  NaranTeam 
 Savitri is well over 70 years of age. One morning, she couldn’t get up from bed because of lower back pain. Through her husband she informed Naran S, Balakumar, who asked her to chant continuously the mantra, “Vallabam Gajaananam Yeka Thandham”. Savitri chanted for more than two hours. Soon after she could get up from bed and start her normal work at home. 
 Thus, this Vallabam mantra works very effectively on lower back pain as well as in the root chakra. It’s good for getting a good and secured job too.
