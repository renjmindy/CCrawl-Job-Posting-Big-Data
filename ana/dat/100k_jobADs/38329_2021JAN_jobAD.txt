 In Wake of Canoe 
 I’m going after God, 
not content with 
God's coming to me. I’ll 
seize the divine 
cloak – here in 
oak, there in 
wave slipping away 
in wake of 
canoe. 
 It won’t do 
for me to sit 
patiently like Job 
did until he didn’t. 
I’ll raise a fist to divinity 
and a pint to mystery. I’ll 
cheer the thunder 
clap resounding as 
lightning ferrets 
out traces of 
the divine. 
 I’ll look into her 
eyes, rimmed with 
hope and worry 
both and I’ll see 
God seeing me, 
God coming 
after 
me.
