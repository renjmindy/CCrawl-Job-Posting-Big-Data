 you're comfortable working independently to draw conclusions and take action, having demonstrated a strong level of comfort in driving projects forward

 Benefits 
 We believe in a healthy work-life balance. Don't get us wrong, we are passionate about what we do and super ambitious; yes, there are days where we are all huddled up in an office at 10pm to strategise about our next big move but this is the exception and not the norm. We believe that great things can be achieved through efficiency & strategic thinking rather than just 'doing' and 'rushing' without a proper plan. 
 
 Work remotely:   Distance makes the heart grow fonder, so we encourage a sporadic change of scenery whenever you need some time out of the office 
 Generous holidays  : 28 Days + Bank holidays + Christmas break + Birthday (Everyone is strongly encouraged to take at least five days off each quarter) 
 Location:   Office in a lively Co-Working Space close to Highbury-Islington Station (Victoria Line + Overground). We plan to move to our own amazing office in North-East London within the next 3 months 
 **Share our success:  **We know our future growth is only possible if we all work together as a team, so every full-time team member has share options. 
 **Our team:  **We're an energetic, sociable and talented bunch who are super passionate about what we do and determined to make a difference. We're all in it together and we learn from each other.
Employee Perks: We're young and still working out how we reward our employees beyond the standard offerings. As part of our founding team, you will be directly involved in helping us shape this offering. E.g. Training budget, getaways (bi-annualy), well-being budget, noah credits, regular team events, home office budget 
 
 **Salary Range:  **We are flexible based on experience and this is a vital role in shaping the future of noah, we offer  comprehensive share options for our founding team. 
 If you have always wanted to join a young and rapidly growing startup as a founding member with significant impact, please do not hesitate to reach out to us! 
 You can contact us here with your CV (PDF) and a short cover letter, including your idea for our next Starter Kit. 
 We are an Equal Opportunity Employer and strongly believe that building a diverse and inclusive team is fundamental to our success. We want to hear from you regardless of your gender, race, religion, age, sexual orientation, marital status or disability.
