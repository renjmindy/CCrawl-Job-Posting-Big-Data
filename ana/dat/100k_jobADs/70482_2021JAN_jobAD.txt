  3 Tips For How To Keep Your Dream Job  
 Amanda Green 
 April 24, 2013 
 The world is experiencing serious economic recession that has led to high unemployment rates. This shouldn't discourage you from pursuing your  dream job , though. However, you should keep in mind that finding a job is one thing and keeping it is another. So many people have the potential to get their preferred jobs in various fields, but without the ability to maintain these jobs, it becomes hard to win the trust and favor of their bosses. Do you know how to keep your dream job? 
 
 3 Tips For Keeping Your Dream Job 
 As a concerned employee, you need to ask yourself, “Will I manage to maintain my current job?” Considering that it's not easy to get a job nowadays, you should always try your best to maintain your current source of income. This means one thing: you have to please your boss and promote the entire company by following the tips explained below. 
 1. Think Outside The Box 
 Most employees are normally obsessed with their salaries, but as a smart worker, don’t let your boss know that you’re more interested in your pay slip than the company’s success. As interested as you may be in your salary, the only way to get a fat pay slip is by working hard. This can be achieved by letting your boss know about your vision for the company. Most companies are always competing for a wider market - this is the time when your employer needs you more than ever. Don’t wait until your boss decides to call an office meeting for you to break the news about your vision for the company. Instead, approach your superiors with a clever business strategy in mind and you will be sure of earning their trust and favor. You’ll no longer be an ordinary employee, and if the company ever decides to fire some of its employees due to some reasons such as economic recession, you’ll not be part of the list. 
 2. Neutralize Competition From Rival Companies 
 Sometimes, expansion policies are not always the ultimate solution for any company that wishes to succeed in the crowded job market. Your company might be producing ineffective products and if it expands its business to other areas without correcting such mistakes, it’ll make things worse. It’s even better to operate a small, professional, and effective business that has a higher chance of attracting customer loyalty instead of a large business with a negative reputation in the market. As an employee, try your best to stand out from the rest by approaching your boss at the personal level to explain various challenges facing that particular business and how they can be neutralized. For example, if rival companies are producing similar products at a lower price, you can suggest the introduction of discounts, coupon codes, and other offers to attract more clients. Don’t be afraid to approach your boss - this is the only way you’ll be able to understand each other, appreciate your strengths and weaknesses, and more importantly, work as a team for the sake of the company’s success. 
 3. Study Your Current Workplace And Provide Recommendations 
 From the above two tips, it’s safe to say that your company’s success depends on its image and target market. On the other hand, you also need to think about the inner image. This takes time since you don’t want to provide recommendations and ideas before settling into your new job. As you establish yourself as one of the most adored employees in that particular company, you can start suggesting various  ideas  to improve the interior appearance of your workplace. For example, there are so many cities in the U.S. where you can find  specials on used office furniture , such as Baton Rouge. You can convince your boss to take advantage of such offers in this city to save money while upgrading the interior appearance of the office, therefore creating a professional image to their clients. Have you ever wondered why there are so many people who lose their jobs as quickly as they get them? Well, now you know there’s a great difference between learned employees and the smart ones who know what it takes to maintain their jobs.
