 Yesterday we started a unique collaboration between  BIF , M.C.Overalls and 2nd year students of  University of Westminster's Fashion Marketing & Promotion BA Hons : 0-1. 
 Alongside BIF head honcho Matt Hart, we kicked off a learning programme which explored the mindset to get from 0 to 1 in the workplace - combining some neuroscience with practical insight into how to harness your creativity in an enterprise economy: learning by doing, finding inspiration and long, hard yards. A far cry from the traditional weight of worrying about a 'career'… 
 We have invited the students to a series of workshops at our store, in which other brand owners and fashion leads get to tell their 0-1 story. 
 Finally, we set the students a real brief about our business. In due course, they will get to execute it with us. 
 It is after all #ApprenticeshipWeek. 
 Huge thanks to course lead Caline Anouti for welcoming us.
