 Ireland's award-winning careers fair goes virtual - Here's why you should be there! 
 With the graduate recruitment drive of 2020 being like no other that has gone before, employers ' diaries are likely filling up with an increasing number of virtual careers fairs. While careers fairs have traditionally played a fundamental role in the gradu   ate recruitment process, they can be costly and time-consuming for employers to attend and there is a limit to the number of applicants, with no opportunity for employers to screen for suitable candidates. 
 Virtual fairs have no such limitations, and events such as the upcoming gradireland Graduate Careers Fair on September 30th and October 1st, represent a unique opportunity for employers and graduates to connect in a customised virtual environment. Produced in partnership with third level institutions throughout Ireland, the virtual Graduate Careers Fair will attract thousands of students over two days and will feature a wide range of Ireland's top employers and post graduate providers. In addition, we will have a packed schedule of virtual seminars and workshops designed to provide students with practical information during this uncertain time. 
 Despite the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, students and graduates continue to invest significant time in exploring their career paths and applying for jobs. With many fairs cancelled during virus restrictions, virtual events are increasingly attractive to students and graduates. Using our bespoke graduate fair platform, your virtual booth can be created quickly and easily, including content and marketing materials, and you can reuse content for future virtual events too, saving time and collateral. Attendees can interact with your company through webinars, real-time chat and videos. 
 With time and resources at a premium, events like the gradireland virtual Graduate Careers Fair are a cost and time-effective solution. You can access the event from anywhere at any time, with members of your team being logged into the event together. Additional time-saving benefits for employers include applicant screening and CV search tools which allow you to identify candidates of interest ahead of the event. Attendees can also request meetings with you, allowing you to build up a pipeline of promising talent well ahead of the event even going live. 
 While the energy and buzz of traditional fairs are impossible to replicate, the virtual experience can eliminate a lot of the unnecessary and unproductive exchanges that are inherent in a physical setting. At the gradireland virtual Graduate Careers Fair, you will have a far higher chance of engaging with candidates that are the right fit for your business. Also, the virtual experience benefits students who may be nervous in physical settings. It also cuts through the social mobility divide, allowing you to talk to students and graduates from all regions and backgrounds. 
 The gradireland virtual Graduate Careers Fair takes place on September 30th and October 1st. To get all the information you need, and to book your place, click  here .
