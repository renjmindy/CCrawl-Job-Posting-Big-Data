 New Job, First Night Shift! 
 30 Nov 
 Howdy ladies and gents, time for me to divulge another chapter from my life and luckily it is one of the happier variety. Recently I just got a new job and it was honestly one my favourite first-day-on-the-job experiences I've ever had. 
 This is honestly how I felt after I got my new job. New job, new possibilities! ðŸ˜€ 
 For those who have followed this blog for a while, you may remember that I had a job back at the late side of summer, it was a hard job, but the staff and atmosphere was incredible, but I got let go in early September. To be honest it was my fault because I blogged about my workplace and used visual examples (idiot). So yeah I've been without a proper job for a while now, but after drifting through the ocean of unemployment, someone threw me a lifeline and now I'm back in the game with consistent work up until New Year's. 
 Now for obvious reasons I'm not gonna disclose any information relating to my job in case someone's watching me from the shadows (and waiting to try and mess me up). So all I will tell you that the job is similar to stuff I've done before and the location I work at is proper fancy and cool. 
 Last night I started my first shift there and it was first of many night shifts! Now I've always heard a lot about night shifts and had been curious to try it out myself one day just to see if I'd survive. My dad had been doing it for years and I always thought he was hardcore for doing so, I think he was my inspiration for taking on this type of work. So let's just say that my job requires me to continuously keep moving and help out of people, it is crazy, busy, chaotic and can get messy. However once you get into the groove of things, it's actually pretty fun and I had a good session. It helped that the music was varied, cool, nostalgic and got some oft he other staff dancing. And speaking of the staff they're some of the most helpful, funny and coolest people I've come across in any job for a while. They were great and to be honest I couldn't have asked for better people to work with. 
 My work hours was initially meant to be from 7.30pm to 6am! That scared the life out of my at first, but it wasn't that bad, plus I got left got slightly early at 4am which was wicked. I pretty much slept like a brick until around 4pm today, so I obviously haven't been up for that long haha. 
 The only thing that worries me about this job is how it clashes with my 3rd year uni work. My animation module is getting proper crazy with the deadlines and presentation at the moment and in all honesty I'm not sure how I'm gonna juggle it all, but hell imma try. Gotta survive and rise above! ðŸ™‚
