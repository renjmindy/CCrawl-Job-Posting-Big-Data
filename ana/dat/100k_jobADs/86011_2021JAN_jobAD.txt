 Don’t fall down on the job! Get ready for the 2018 stand-down 
 April 11, 2018  /  BWC Social Media Team 
 By Mike Marr, BWC Technical Resource Consultant 
 Do you know what the leading cause of worker fatalities is in construction? Each year, between 150 and 200 workers die, and more than 100,000 are injured, as a result of falls at construction sites. 
 Additionally, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) lists fall protection in construction as its  most frequently cited standard . 
 To raise the level of awareness and reduce injuries and fatalities, OSHA promotes an annual  National Safety Stand-Down to Prevent Falls . The stand-down encourages employers across the nation to hold events in conjunction with the multi-day event, May 7-11 this year. As always, the stand-down encourages employers to pause during their workday for topic discussions, safety demonstrations, and trainings in hazard recognition and fall prevention. 
 We’re hosting a free fall protection training event 9 a.m. to noon May 7 at our Ohio Center for Occupational Safety and Health in Pickerington. To register, visit the  BWC Learning Center  and enter Stand-Down Event in the search field. The training, provided by Guardian Fall Protection, will feature a fall protection trailer demonstration and classroom instruction. 
 On May 7, our Garfield Heights Claims Office will also host a stand-down event at 9 a.m. Call Ana Cammarata at (216) 318-9178 to register. 
 Additionally, we’re partnering with Boak & Sons, Inc. and MALTA Dynamics for a no-cost fall protection training from 7:30 – 8:30 a.m. May 8 at Boak & Sons Inc. location in Austintown. To RSVP, email  David.C.12@bwc.state.oh.us  or  David.L.2@bwc.state.oh.us . We may add more events in the coming weeks. 
 Don’t forget the  BWC Library  offers an extensive collection of audiovisual materials related to fall hazards and fall prevention. We also offer year-round classes throughout Ohio to address fall protection requirements. 
 It’s not too late for your company or organization to plan a stand-down event. We’re here if you need help planning your activity. Just call 1-800-644-6292 for assistance. 
 To see a list of events in Ohio and across the nation, visit OSHA’s  stand-down events page .
