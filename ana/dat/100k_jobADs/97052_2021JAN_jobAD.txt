 Front-End UI/UX Developer REMOTECONTRACT 
 Job Description 
 Flipbox is a small, experienced back-end development shop specializing in large integration projects, plugin development and infrastructure architecture. To date, we’ve worked closely with ad and branding agencies who were responsible for UI/UX and front-end development. Currently, we’re looking for an experienced individual to fill this void. 
 Expectations 
This is a remote contract position; starting at an estimated 20hr per week (with a monthly commitment). Depending on fit and experience, this could become a full-time position (where you would run all creative at Flipbox). Compensation is based on experience. 
 Skills/Technologies 
We’re building new processes around Vue.js and Tailwind CSS frameworks and pre-processors such as Laravel Mix and Webpack. These will become the pillars for new projects and experience with these is beneficial. Existing projects also use AngularJS, jQuery, Sass, Bourbon/Neat, and Gulp and we'll be working to migrate away from these over time. 
 Responsibilities/Projects 
Much of our work involves services clients (retainer work). You will be expected to work directly with client’s; recommending and executing UI/UX changes. Also, we have a variety of internal projects which include; site/microsite/landing page creation, Craft CMS plugin admin UI/UX, and email campaigns.
