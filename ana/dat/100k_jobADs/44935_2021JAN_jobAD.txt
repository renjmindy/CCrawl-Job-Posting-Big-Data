 Sarah P 's comments : Thanks, Librarian  Ray Pun , for sharing this opportunity… 
 There is a vacancy for a Business Librarian at the University of Oxford (Bodleian Libraries) to lead and manage information services in the fields of business, management and finance at the highest level. Responsible for the development of innovative, user-focused services, provision of information resources and the management of library staff, the Bodleian Business Librarian is a key member of the Saïd Business School and the Bodleian Libraries, and works to ensure that the Sainsbury Library is widely regarded as a leading library among top and emergent business schools. 
 The current incumbent is retiring after 9 years in the role during which time the Library has made significant advancements in: expanding access to research resources; the online dissemination of the School’s research outputs; new approaches to instructional support and a number of improvements to the library study environments. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to build upon this work and develop new services to meet current challenges and emerging needs.
