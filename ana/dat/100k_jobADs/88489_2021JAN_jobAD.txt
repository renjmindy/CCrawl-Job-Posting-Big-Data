 ScalaJS frontend developer to implement visual programming language for biologists. 
 Role overview 
 Radix is an early stage start-up building a next generation visual programming language and optimizing compiler that takes biotech procedures and compiles them to instructions that can be executed in a physical biology lab. Biologists describe their protocol in our front end language and our compiler and run-time system realize this in their physical lab. The user experience here is key because biologists shouldn‚Äôt need to be programmers to not have to spend 5 hours every day doing manual pipetting for hard to reproduce unoptimized minutia that isn‚Äôt innovative. We hope to accelerate biotech innovation like early compilers did for computing by enabling lab protocols to seamlessly operate and be optimized across physical labs. We have funding from some pretty cool people (YCombinator, Firstminute Capital, MIT's The Engine, and Nikesh Arora) and have multiple pilots in academic research labs and commercial biotech corporations, and this number is growing. We‚Äôre looking for pragmatic individuals who appreciate great interfaces and want to make a big difference for our users‚Äîbiologists and lab workers and biology as a discipline, and enable them to have good tooling that simply abstracts away menial work. 
 We‚Äôre 100% a Scala shop. While we don‚Äôt require that you already know Scala, you will need to become proficient in it quickly. If you have experience with Scala, Erlang, Ocaml, Prolog, Haskell, and/or Java, we‚Äôre especially enthusiastic to hear from you. We don‚Äôt hire people who don‚Äôt enjoy learning and teaching. You can expect to learn from and teach world class engineers. 
 Key skills: 
 
 Human factors, user centered, graphic and/or general design implementation‚Äîthe more the merrier! 
 Experience with front end web development for interfaces that are straightforward, intuitive, simple, and beautiful 
 Think writing web code with functional programming in Scala, specifically Slinky (a React wrapper for Scala.js)‚Äîwith a talented team of dev-ops compilers, and automation engineers behind you sounds like a fun and exciting adventure 
 Have Thoughts and Feelings about visual programming language design and graphical based protocol version control systems 
 Strong critical thinking and causal reasoning skills 
 Experience with functional and object oriented programming or a strong desire and demonstrated capacity to learn 
 Keen to learn and collaborative 
 Experience with GNU/Linux (we work in Linux) and Git for version control 
 
 Nice to have: 
 
 Have done some things in a bio lab or think this sounds cool 
 Interested in or have experience with interpreters, compilers, and/or run-time systems‚Äîeither professionally, as a hobby, or as a curiosity 
 Experience tracking down annoying, hard to find, and arcane software bugs 
 Experience implementing actor systems ‚Äì we use Akka 
 Experience working with and deploying fail-safe soft real time distributed systems (especially the hashicorp stack, Apache Kafka, Aeron UDP, and/or AWS) 
 
 Radix is a exciting work environment. We care about each other. We‚Äôre also LGBTQ+, polyamoroy, kink, gender, minority, and most other things supporting. We're an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, veteran or disability status.

 Biology has talented PhD Biologists spend 5 hours a day on hard to reproduce, unoptimized minutia that isn‚Äôt innovative. Radix Labs hope to accelerate biotech innovation like early compilers did for computing by enabling lab protocols to seamlessly operate and be optimized across physical labs. Our software makes biology reproducible, faster, more efficient, and lets smart biologists focus on the science instead of managing the implementation. This has direct implications during COVID-19 when biologists are trying to move faster than ever before to develop vaccines, treatments, and discover fundamental science behind SARS-CoV-2. Radix is an early stage startup building an optimizing compiler that takes biotech procedures and compiles them to instructions that can be executed in a physical biology lab. Well plates are our ‚Äúmemory‚Äù and our move instruction is telling a lab worker or pipetting robot to move a substance or physical object from one location to another. We build fundamental abstractions over biology labs including work-flow specification, optimized program compilation to varied back-end targets (real labs) and put it behind great UX. We have funding from some pretty cool people (YCombinator, Firstminute Capital, MIT's The Engine, and Nikesh Arora) and have multiple pilots in academic research labs and commercial biotech corporations, and this number is growing. We‚Äôre looking for pragmatic individuals who appreciate well done code and want to make a big difference for our users‚Äîbiologists and lab workers and biology as a discipline, and enable them to have good tooling that abstracts away menial work.
