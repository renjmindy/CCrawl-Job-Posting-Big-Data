  Can I Make Up My Job Title?  
 Work It Daily 
 August 25, 2009 
 Dear Experts. I was hired as an administrative assistant at a small company two years ago. Since then, my job has changed a lot and now, 90% of my time is doing things for our company web site. I've taught myself all sorts of programs and am very good at it. I saw a job in the paper to do this full-time and want to apply, but know they won't give me a second look if they don't see the 'web designer' in the title. Is it okay to change it on my resume to reflect that since it's really what I do now?  Here is how our T.A.P. experts answered this question:   Q#262  Maybe use Web Designer (Admin Asst) - to show actual role alongside true title. Emphasis on what u do vs title. ( @ValueIntoWords )  Q#262  Title shud reflect what ref ck will reveal. HOWEVER sell UR design value B4 they reach job title on rez. ( @dawnbugni )  Q#262  You can highlight that in a header at the top & discuss in cover. U should not change ur title considered lying. ( @DebraWheatman )  Q#262  1st ask 4 title change 2 reflect what u do now; don't change it urself as ref check will expose ur lie. ( @juliaerickson )  Q#262  Always use title you were given - don't want confusion down the line. Just add "/Web Designer" after it. ( @jtodonnell )  Q#262  Yes, but it would be better to negotiate a title change with your employer to avoid confusion and future problems. ( @gradversity )  Q#262  Since 90%of your duties have changed - include n job title on resume "admin asst/web designer" 4 accuracy. ( @kgrantcareers )  Q#262  Include real title/Web Designer. KEY=CONTENT must focus on making connections btwn U & their needs. ( @keppie_careers )  Our Twitter Advice Project (T.A.P.) is no longer an active campaign.
