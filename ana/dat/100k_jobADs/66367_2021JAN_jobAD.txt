 Now bigger and better. 
 “In 2018 Librans have the bricks and the mortar and are digging the foundations for a new and better you. All the tools are in place and the plans just need to be finalised. So be the architect of your future and start doing to designs for the lifestyle you want to be living. In 2018 the vital parts of the design are the foundation and so you need to work on a solid self esteem and high self worth to make sure your new house will survive any hurricane that comes its way. 2018 is also about a gold rush; yes, you are prospecting for gold hidden within – character traits and abilities perhaps yet undiscovered or un tapped which contain a wealth of ingredients for success. You are successful in business and with money yet material goals are just a small part of a year that is significant in terms of how you feel about you and your sense of value and worth. The real gold is the pot of gold inside you; that store of energy, love, indestructible drive and optimism.” 
 A big thank you to all the amazon and B&N buyers who supported me over the past 4 years and also to my youtube channel subscribers.
