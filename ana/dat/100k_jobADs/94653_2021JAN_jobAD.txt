  Will Volunteering Help Me Land Job?  
 Work It Daily 
 August 14, 2009 
 Dear Experts, The job I am interested in and have already applied for is hosting a volunteer event in a month. Would it be considered inappropriate to show up and volunteer or could it help me in the application process?  Here is how our T.A.P. experts answered this question:   Q#248  YES! Volunteering shows character, commitment & teamwork. It's also best way to network w/ GOOD people. ( @jtodonnell )  Q#248  Volunteering shows commitment but also may help you make connections & learn more about the org. for interviews. ( @louise_fletcher )  Q#248  Definitely show up & volunteer. Gr8 way 2 demonstrate your commitment and interest. Network it! ( @DebraWheatman )  Q#248  May / may not help in application process, but if done right (sincerely), could add value 2 ur message. (2:2) ( @ValueIntoWords )  Q#248  Volunteering=generally good. Approach w/genuine interest; b friendly, helpful, intrsted in event needs. (1:2) ( @ValueIntoWords )  Q#248  VOLUNTEER also if search is slow or U may find physical, mental & emotional sluggishness sets in. ( @RTResumePro )  Q#248  Just became unemployed? Volunteer now to increase your marketability, U can rest later. ( @RTResumePro )  Q#248  1 month away may be too late. If it was closer, I'd say to definitely try. Couldn't hurt to attempt! ( @beneubanks )  Q#248  It would be a good move, if only for the networking opportunities that it will bring. Go for it! ( @gradversity )  Our Twitter Advice Project (T.A.P.) is no longer an active campaign. To find an answer to the above question, please use the "Search" box in the right-hand column of this website.
