 Psychedelic Research Center 
 Published: Yesterday  Bids: 2 
 I want to build a building, designed for the sole purpose of researching psychedelic chemicals and allowing people a safe place to trip. 
 Note: This project won’t be rushed, and ideally everyone that helps with it, should have some psychedelic experience. The building will most likely be built in Brazil, where the majority of psychedelics are legal, but If we get the approval of the usa government, we will start in the usa. Eventually though my vision is to have centers in every country and every state that allow for safe, and responsible psychedelic adventures!
