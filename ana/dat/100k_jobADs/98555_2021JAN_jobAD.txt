 This is the Jewel in My Heavenly Crown 
 This is the task my master has given me 
 “My only aim is to finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me—the task of testifying to the good news of God's grace.” (Acts 20:24 New International Version) 
 While enjoying my morning meal of “The Breakfast of Champions” Bible reading (after all, read the treasures within. Isn’t it chocked full of champions?) this verse stood out to me. It made me feel good. 
 Imagine a king or emperor giving a special task, just for you. 
 My task is being a Christian writer and the longer I partake of my divine task, the less of a task it is. Every time an article helps someone draw closer to Christ that will be another jewel in my crown in Heaven. 
 Then when Christ, the Chief Shepherd, comes, you will get a glorious crown that will never lose its beauty. 1 Peter 5:4 New Century Version 
 Do you know why the crown will never lose its beauty? 
 It is because the jewels which are more precious than jade or diamonds are the people I have been blessed to help draw closer to Christ. THEY are the jewels. 
 We all have our calling in the heavenly family. When you do your part, you too will inherit a precious crown. Are you doing the task our master has assigned you? When you feel exhausted or dejected and want to quit, remember your crown awaiting you in Heaven. Do not believe any task is little, small or insignificant? 
 The truly generous is the truly wise, and he who loves not others, lives unblest. Henry Home 
 When I was a teacher I planted the seeds in some of my students. I look forward to meeting them in Heaven and sharing huge hugs and tears of joy with them. 
 So too it is with you. The little seed you plant today may become a beautiful apple tree that produces much Heavenly fruit tomorrow. 
 Read about the great evangelists of yesterday like Billy Graham and Spurgeon or Billy Sunday. Some were real party boys. They heard one little sermon or had one little encounter with a Christian and they went on to set the world on fire. 
 You too could be the match that sets the next Billy Graham on the world. 
 "Use what talents you possess; the woods would be very silent if no birds sang there except those that sang best." – William Blake 
 No you do not desire your crown for pride but rather joy. The joy being that you have in some way guided another to heaven. It will be joy for them not pride for you. Joseph- Anthony: Green 
 If you believe you only have little in the way of skills or resources remember this: Little in the hands of Jesus can do much. 
 As well every time you serve Christ whether in your vocation, volunteer work or every day life, you will be putting another jewel in your crown. 
 There is no small act of kindness here on earth that is not great in Heaven. Joseph- Anthony: Green 
 Prayer: Thank you Jehovah Jireh (God our Provider) for the wonderful privilege of having so many precious jewels in my crown. I ask my beloved that You bless me with so many more opportunities to add more jewels to this crown. As well oh cherished one, may these jewels have their own crowns to give even more glory to You. I give thanks and ask for this blessing in the name of Him who wears the most treasured crown, Jesus Christ. Amen. 
 May the sunshine of Jesus’ sweet love bless you today and every day.

 Will Find It.

 And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me. He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for My sake will find it. Matthew 10:38-39 New King James Version 
 How many for eons have folks wondered the meaning of life? 
 They foolishly waste their time amassing material wealth. 
 Those with the most toys when they die are not the happiest nor the riches, they are the saddest and poorest in spirit., Joseph- Anthony: Green 
 Chasing after satanic religions like buddihism or new agers still leaves them with a empty feeling and purpose. 
 There is only one way to enlightenment and that is through the Holy Spirit. All else is satan disguised as light as he leads you down to an eternal Hell. Joseph- Anthony: Green 
 Some try to maintain a super fit body all of their lives, sorry but you will be in for quite the shock on your death bed when you realize it was all for naught. We all die and then go to our eternal rewards’. That is not to say we should not take proper care of our bodies, just do not worship them. 
 Some find it in raising a family. Oh the deep sadness when their children grow up and they are left with an empty nest and an empty heart, especially if they distance themselves from you which is all too common today. There is nothing wrong with enjoying having a Christian family but those who worship their children and grand children are raising selfish, self centered child which grow into selfish, self centered adults. The only time they call mommy or daddy or grandma or grandpa is when they want money. They do not appreciate it and give nothing in return. They never call, come to visit or help. They are waiting for them to die so they can get their inheritance and spend it foolishly. I unfortunately see all too often as seniors live a daily hell of loneliness and deep sadness in isolation. This is a shame upon the children and a disgrace. 
 Others worship their careers. It is all for naught. They will lose it when their career is out dated, which happens all too common today. In many instances people are replaced by robots. How about when you retire, then what are you going to do with your life if it has been centered on your career? 
 But when we become free willing servant to Christ our King we will find the true meaning of their lives when Jehovah blesses us with revealing it to them. It will not be easy the following path Jehovah has chosen for you but well worth it in our daily lives and in our eternal ones. 
 Following Christ is not easy but the rewards are Heavenly. Joseph- Anthony: Green 
 Prayer: Thank you Jehovah-Rohi – Shepherd for being such a patient and wise Shepherd to this at times obstinate little , sheep. Please bless all who place their faith in You with guiding them to the lives You have purposed for them before they were even born. I exalt You and humble beseech You in the name of the greatest shepherd Jesus Christ. Amen. 
 May Jehovah bless you today and every day with His precious love, joy and peace.

 Fight When Right 
 Do you see an injustice? 
 Than have confidence in God and stand up to them. 
 I have many times. 
 You know what; you might be surprised who will stand up with you. 
 One time in a tree panting camp a foreman was treating rookies very bad. 
 I stood up to him. 
 This angered the camp supervisor and he arranged a little show down between his goons and me. 
I told them “You may beat me, but I will get back up, spit my blood in your face and kick your buts. When I am right I WILL FIGHT even unto my last breath.” 
 I was prepared to receive a butt kicking. 
 I heard a small voice saying: Don’t worry. I am sending you help.” I was expecting a legion of angels to come thundering out of the clouds. 
 What I didn’t know was that when hearing this many of the other planters quietly moved behind me, a road crew repairing a damaged section of the Alaska Highway joined in. 
 What started out as fifteen of them against me were now forty of them with me against fifteen of the camp supervisors goons. Now believe these boys were no angels. Ha ha but I believe God moved their hearts to step forward and risk an all out war. We would have all gotten fired as well. 
 Needless to say the goons quickly backed down. I then TOLD the foreman and camp supervisor to get over here and apologize to these boys or I am coming over there and kick your butt. They had to humble themselves in front of the whole camp. 
 Later many people came over and mentioned how they admired that I stood up. My reply was that it is the duty of every Christian to stand up and fight for what is right. 
 “A man dies once, a coward dies many times.” Mexican proverb 
 And it is so true. Remember: it is our Christian duty to stand up and fight when we see an injustice. 
 "And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell" ( Matt. 10:28  New International Version) 
 "For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart"  Hebrews 4:12  (New American Standard Bible). 
 Prayer: Oh Jehovah Nissi( the Lord is our banner, that means He goes out in front of us when we fight the right fight) I admit sometimes when I see an injustice I tremble in fear. Please give me a strong and courageous heart that has faith You will be right there with me, like David. A faith and ambition like Paul's . In the name of the mighty warrior king Jesus Christ I pray. Amen. 
 May the sunshine of Jesus’ sweet love bless you today and every day.

 There is Nothing Concealed. 
 So do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. Matthew 10:26 New International Version 
 Since becoming close with Christ I have noticed a familiar pattern pattern emerge in my social contacts in every aspect of my life. There have been so many times wicked individuals have, unbeknownst to me, laid traps for me, sometimes by themselves, others in groups. 
 Being naive and gullible as I am I was always an easy mark for the wicked schemers and con artists. 
 However, the result was always the same. 
 The trap they laid for me I escaped from and they always fell into their own wicked traps. They were stunned and enraged at me. Many times they pretentiously fake innocence. They slowly learned not to attempt such foolish endeavors again. As well, they avoid me like the plague because they cannot get away with their scams. They are so dishonest they cannot function in any other way in their lives but to lie, connive, deceive and or manipulate others. 
 When you hear of the wicked and powerful thinking up ways to ensnare you, do not be afraid of them but have faith in the wisest most powerful protector of them all , Jehovah God. He continually will arrange circumstances so that you walk away looking righteous while others laugh at the wicked fools as they end up covered with protectorthier own dung heaped upon their faces. 
 I have experienced this at school, work, with family and in relationships. It covers all aspects of our social life, school life and work life. 
 The wicked think they are so smart as they lay traps for the righteous but God in Heaven laughs at them as He guide the righteous around the traps and the wicked fall into their own traps. Joseph- Anthony: Green 
 When you have a respectful, loving relationship with Christ He will protect you from such scam artists if you are obedient unto His heeding. This has been oh so true in my walk with Him. 
 Prayer: Thank you Jehovah Hoshe'ah (The Lord Saves) for rescuing me from the evil plots the wicked arrogantly lay before me to trap me. I joyfully thank you in the name of He who outwitted the Pharisee’s when they tried to outwit Him Jesus Christ. Amen. 
 May the sunshine of Jesus’ sweet love bless you today and every day.

 How are You Using Your Talents? 
 “Again, it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his wealth to them. **** To one he gave five bags of gold, to another two bags, and to another one bag, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey. **** The man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five bags more. So also, the one with two bags of gold gained two more. **** But the man who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money. “After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have gained five more.’ **** “His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’ “The man with two bags of gold also came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with two bags of gold; see, I have gained two more.’ “His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’ “Then the man who had received one bag of gold came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.’ “His master replied, ‘You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest. “‘So take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags. **** For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Matthew 25:14-30  New King James Version  **** 
 Jehovah has blessed each of us with a talent to be used in His Kingdom work. Now whether you use them for His service or whether you use them for your own is your choice. 
 So we will say Jehovah has blessed you with awesome cinema making talents. 
 How are you going to use them? 
 Are you going to use them to make pornos which creates lust of the flesh in men and womens hearts (and yes women watch porn) or are you going to use them to make movies which create a desire for Christ in the lost worlds hearts? 
 Beware. 
 You will be held accountable for how you are using those talents. 
 You may be blessed with more than one talent. 
 For me I was blessed with being a teacher but also a mentor (there is a difference between teacher and mentor. A teacher you teach and a mentor you lead the way. A teacher is for a short time while mentoring can last years. A teacher teaches many in one class but a mentor teaches one on one). 
 And Bezalel and Aholiab, and every gifted artisan in whom the Lord has put wisdom and understanding, to know how to do all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, shall do according to all that the Lord has commanded. Exodus 36:1  New King James Version  **** 
 Now Jehovah has blessed you with a skill. Will you give Him credit for it or will you foolishly believe that that came from your own skill. 
 So think f it like this. You train someone to become an Olympic gold swimmer. When interviewed they take all the credit and not even mention your name. 
 Will you not feel insulted? 
 How much more will Jehovah feel insulted because you refuse to honour Him with your talents in His kingdom or refusing to give a tenth of your wages? 
 Yes, Jesus is our Saviour, as such that means we are His servants. Servants do not tell the King how, when or where they will serve, they just obey their Kings commands. Joseph- Anthony: Green 
 Prayer: Please Jehovah-Bara (The Lord God our Creator) instill in me a desire and knowledge to use opportunities You present before me both big and small to fulfill Your predestined purpose for my life. I sincerely ask this in the name of He who was obedient all the way to the cross to fulfill His predestined purpose Jesus Christ. Amen 
 May the sunshine of Jesus’ sweet love bless you today and every day.

 There are Six Killers 
 
 There are six killers that destroy society today. 
 “But if you refuse to listen to the Lord your God and do not obey all the commands and decrees I am giving you today, all these curses will come and overwhelm you:Your towns and your fields will be cursed. Your fruit baskets and breadboards will be cursed. 
Your children and your crops will be cursed. The offspring of your herds and flocks 
will be cursed. Wherever you go and whatever you do, you will be cursed. “The Lord himself will send on you curses, confusion, and frustration in everything you do, until at last you are completely destroyed for doing evil and abandoning me. The Lord will afflict you with diseases until none of you are left in the land you are about to enter and occupy. The Lord will strike you with wasting diseases, fever, and inflammation, with scorching heat and drought, and with blight and mildew. These disasters will pursue you until you die. Deuteronomy 28:15-22 New International Version 
 There are six killers that destroy society today. 
 One: Electronic entertainment. 
 Now I am not saying there is anything wrong with TV, the internet or mobile phones. 
 What is wrong is that people spend too much time in front of the idiot box, on the internet and texting each other instead of personal contact with each other. 
 Instead of spending time doing things together as a family, most people are zombies with their electronics. 
 Have you ever seen people sitting at a table with each other and spending time texting instead of talking with each other. 
 I always inform people that if they want to spend time with me, they must turn off their mobiles first. 
 Religion. 
 It is not important whether it is Christianity, Judaism, Muslims, or Buddhism they all have the same core values. People need that in order to have the proper values in their lives. 
 Family. 
 How many people are spending so much time working that they are neglecting their marriages and children? 
 Who is better to raise your children: a mother and father or the internet or TV or texting? Instead of sitting around the supper table and talking about each others day, how many families are zoned out watching the idiot box? 
 I was at an acquaintances house for dinner one time. Everyone was glued to watching a rerun that they knew what it was about after the first scene. When I tried to start a conversation I was hushed. 
 As well how many people spend one day a week doing thing together as a family? How many people are strangers living in the same house? 
 Political correctness 
 There is no absolute right or wrong in society. 
 Everybody wins a prize. There is no failure permitted. 
 Consequently there are educated idiots graduating from schools today that are lucky if they know how to tie their shoes. 
 How many of the great people first suffered failure before they experience success? 
 Read about Thomas Edison and see how many times he failed before he invented the light bulb. 
 We need to understand that just as in the past when everybody did as they pleased it lead to the destruction of their society and ultimately to their country. 
 Look what happened in France in the seventeen hundreds as an example. 
 Commercialism. 
 Everywhere we go whether it is on the idiot box, on the mobile, on the bus, on the internet we are bombarded with buy, buy, buy. 
 How many countries are in debt up to their eyeballs and the people suffer because of greed? 
 How many people are maxed out on their credit cards because they foolishly though buying the newest toy would bring them happiness and are now slaves paying off their debt? 
 And of course the number one reason for the doom of any society is when they turn their backs on God. 
 How can you expect Gods blessings if you do not have an loving obedient relationship with Him? 
 Prayer: Jehovah Yahweh (God of His people) please turn the hearts of the people back to You in order to prevent the doom and destruction of their personal lives, their family lives and their society lives. I humble request this in the name of the King of the most exhaled society, Heaven, Jesus Christ. Amen. 
 May you be blessed with Gods divine love, peace and joy.

 Rely on Him. 
 
 Rely on Him not you. 
 “Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight. Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the Lord and shun evil. This will bring health to your body and nourishment to your bones. Honor the LORD with your wealth, with the firstfruits of all your crops; then your barns will be filled to overflowing …” (Proverbs 3:5-10 New International Version). 
 The right way, the only way. Rely on Him not you. 
 Before I make any decisions I always try to follow a Jewish tradition. That is, to wait three days before making and decisions and pray and read the Bible. 
 One time a really nice contract was offered to me. I wanted it bad but was told to decide right then and there. I chose to walk away because not being offered the chance to wait and pray. It was crushing. Another teacher laughed and took the contract. For three months he was laughing at me and bragging about how good the contract was. Then, the company started demanding more and more from him and began cheating him worse and worse on his wages (a common occurrence here). He begged me to find some way he could get out of the contract to no avail. 
 There was a so called Christian preacher that I really liked and wanted to have a friendship with him. Then he started asking personal questions I felt uncomfortable with and decided to wait and pray before sharing this information with him. The answer was to avoid him like the plague which was very difficult as he seemed like such a cool guy. Turns out he was a charlatan and only wanted the information to control and domineer me like he was doing to some others. 
 We see a little, God sees the complete picture. That is why it is of the utmost importance to always wait and pray and read your Bible, then to obey. It will be hard but from my experience it has resulted in a LOT less grief and trouble. 
 It is like someone wants to sell you a gold mine but really it is just a swamp. The seller may show you little gold flakes and claim he is too old to mine it anymore but is doing you a favour. Instead of going and asking the local mayor who knows everything and is honest and would inform you the cretin is really a snake oil salesman, you rashly and foolishly buy the mine. You end up with a swamp while the snake ends up with all your money. 
 Giving it all to Christ is the best and smartest move of your life. Joseph- Anthony: Green 
 Prayer: Please Jehovah Jireh (God our provider) always provide me with the patience, wisdom and strength to wait and call upon You before I any decisions. Then my beloved give me the strength to follow through on Your wise choices. I ask this in the name of the greatest councilor Jesus Christ. Amen. 
 May the sunshine of Jesus’ sweet love bless you today and every day.

 I am an unpaid live in care giver for my aged mother. As well I regularly do volunteer work with a local church group helping working poor establish themselves independently. . I love being in nature. I say the closer we get to nature the more we see Jehovah. We are blessed in this area with many amazing, easy to ride bicycle trails on old railroad lines that takes us all over Southern Ontario.
