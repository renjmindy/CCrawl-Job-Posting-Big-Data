 Performance-based Intervention with an Employee Affected by Alcoholism and Experiencing Job Performance Problems 
 
 
 Performance-based Intervention with an Employee Affected by Alcoholism and Experiencing Job Performance Problems 
 Posted by Daniel A. Feerst, BSW, MSW, LISW-CP on  Jan 17th 2017 
 
 After reasonable suspicion training, supervisors refer to a testing facility when an employee is identified via signs and symptoms or some other requisite criteria, but there is more to the story if treatment is recommended or there is no larger system of employee assistance programming, no testing protocols, and no referral mechanism to help salvage the worker. Help must still be available to the small business owner--and 80% of USA employers are micro, mini, or family owned businesses. This is the intervention approach I formulated at the Arlington Hospital with the ASSIST for Business program we established there, and used in reaching small businesses from law offices to apartment complexes, gas stations, and local banks. And it worked ethically, effectively, and consistent the chronic disease model, the EAP core technology, and principles of influence and leverage associated with job security as a lever for motivating the alcoholic (usually although we had some PCD and Cocaine referrals) and follow through with treatment, aftercare, follow-up, and recommend treatment programming. Key always is follow up and use of a follow up tool to catch diminishing involvement in a recovery program prior to relapse.
