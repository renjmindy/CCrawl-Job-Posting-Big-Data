 Congressman Joe Neguse Launches Virtual Job and Resource Fair to Help Coloradans Amidst COVID-19 
 July 30, 2020 
 Washington D.C.—Today, Congressman Joe Neguse announced the launch of his first-ever virtual job and resource fair to assist Coloradans navigating new unemployment and the job search process amidst COVID-19. More than 30 million Americans across the country have applied for unemployment since the onset of the virus, many experiencing shocking and unexpected unemployment due to the economic impacts of the virus. As workers navigate the new economic moment, Congressman Neguse’s office is hoping to connect workers to employers in their area, resources, and training through the Virtual Job and Resource Fair. ____ 
 
 “The COVID-19 pandemic has put tremendous strain on workers at every level of our economy, and as a result many Coloradans are facing new unemployment or looking for a change in work to accommodate health and safety conditions,”  said Congressman Joe Neguse.  “In Congress, I am pushing for a robust next-stage economic stimulus package that will support Colorado workers with another round of economic impact payments, an extension of the expanded unemployment insurance many are relying on and support for our small businesses so they can keep staff on payroll. While we continue that important work, our office hopes to be a resource at the community-level as well to provide resources, employment connections and to lend a helping hand through our Virtual Job and Resource Fair. While the challenges of this pandemic are large, no one should have to weather this crisis alone.” __ __ 
 Congressman Neguse has launched a virtual hub online to connect workers to employers in their community, local organizations that can provide resources and a series of trainings and workshops. Congressman Neguse’s office will facilitate two training and resource sessions for workers in Boulder and Larimer County, to connect them with resources, experts and employers in their area. The sessions will be hosted on Wednesday, August 12th at 3:00pm MST. ____
