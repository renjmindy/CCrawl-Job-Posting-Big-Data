 Senior Finance Business Partner in Birmingham - 70k - 80k + Bonus 
 Are you a Commercially minded Accountant who enjoys partnering with internal and external partners, driving change and providing financial insight? 
 This role will see you working for a growing service provider and being the face of finance across a region. The Regional Finance Business Partner will be home-based but will need to travel to sites (1/2 days a week) and will primarily focus on supporting the business with financial insight and detailed analysis, that will invariably support decision making and drive performance directly associated with the Operational teams. 
 This role would therefore be perfect for an individual who is looking to spend more time in the business, visiting different sites and pushing business performance though detailed analysis. An inquisitive mindset will be essential due to the need to improve processes and offer cost savings solutions.

 To prepare and review the financial statements / reports for the relevant business area in a timely and accurate manner 
 To maintain the integrity of the businesses accounting transactions and ensure anomalies / variances are resolved with relevant parties.
