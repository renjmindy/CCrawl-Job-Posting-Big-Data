 Job Summary 
 
 ProspectingThe first and foremost role of the executive in a company is prospecting. It is the sales executive who has to bring leads to the company through the use of multiple procedures like cold calling, generating inquiries, handling inquiries and other such sales tactics so that they continually bring good leads for the company.2) Building the pipelineThe pipeline comes into the picture which can be built only by the sales executive and which is one of the most important job responsibilities of executives. In this, the executive has to break down the pipeline into hot, warm and cold customers. This stands for customers who are very interested, who are somewhat interested and who are not interested respectively.3) Handling complaintsThis is a very tangible element in sales. By self-management, I mean that the sales executive should know the product of the company in and out. He should also know basic tricks such as negotiation tactics, the best ways of prospecting and converting the prospect to a customer. At the same time, grooming him, improving communications and having discipline are things which the sales executive has to manage himself. These things have a direct impact on the performance and hence the appraisal of the executive.Skills and responsibilities:
