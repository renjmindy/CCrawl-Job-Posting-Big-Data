 Job 26 
 1 But Job answered and said, 
 2 How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength? 
 3 How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is? 
 4 To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee? 
 5 Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof. 
 6 Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering. 
 7 He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing. 
 8 He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them. 
 9 He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it. 
 10 He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end. 
 11 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof. 
 12 He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud. 
 13 By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent. 
 14 Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?

 I will teach you about God’s power. I will not conceal anything concerning the Almighty. 
Job 27:11 NLT 
 This should be our motto everyday with everyone. People should know that we serve a great and powerful God. We need to find ways to add Him to every conversation. No more secret agent Christians. No more concealing the Almighty in superficial relationships. He has given us the power to be witnesses.

 Job rebukes Bildad as he reiterates the greatness of God in this chapter. It reminded me of the song "Redeemer": 
 Who taught the sun where to stand in the morning? 
Who told the ocean you can only come this far? 
Who showed the moon where to hide 'til evening? 
Whose words alone can catch a falling star? 
 Well I know my Redeemer lives 
I know my Redeemer lives 
All of creation testify 
This life within me cries 
 I know my Redeemer lives 
The very same God that spins things in orbit 
He runs to the weary, the worn and the weak 
And the same gentle hands that hold me when I'm broken 
 They conquered death to bring me victory 
Now I know my Redeemer lives 
I know my Redeemer lives 
Let all creation testify

 14These are just the beginning of all that he does, 
merely a whisper of his power. 
Who, then, can comprehend the thunder of his power?” NLT 
 can you say without a doubt that God is an awesome God. He is powerful enough to step into existence and just softly speak to any storm and it settles. He can speak healing and the disease is gone. He can speak joy and trials are over. He can speak life and the hold of death has to release. There is no doubt that my God is all powerful, all knowing, and everywhere at the same time. 
 We find that his voice is not like we hoped it would be but When God spoke to Elijah in 1 Kings 19- 
 11And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake: 12And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice. 
 So we must seek first the kingdom in order for us to be keen to the power of God’s voice. Sometimes we have a tendency to miss it because we are looking for it wrong. God grant me the attentiveness to hear your voice. 
 I love the Kingdom!

 God's power goes beyond our comprehension. To know him is to know his power. We might understand everything God does, but please understand this, he's working for our good. The devil knows how much power God has. This is why he continues to try to get us to doubt him. When we start doubting, we forget that God has all power. Let your faith be increased and your understanding open to see what God can really do.

 “To whom have you uttered [these] words? And whose spirit [inspired what] came forth from you? 
 “The spirits of the dead tremble Underneath the waters and their inhabitants. Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead) is naked before God, And Abaddon (the place of destruction) has no covering [from His eyes].” 
‭‭JOB‬ ‭26:4-6‬ ‭AMP‬‬ 
 Look at the difference here. First this is job rebuking Bildad then he goes on to exalt the Lord to prove his point on Gods power. 
Out all the chaotic things Job has gone through he’s still finds ways to glorify God. This is a man of God right here. He defends what he believes and stands firm on what he believes. Job leaves a great example how our attitudes should be in test and trials.

 Sometimes we need to determine who’s speaking through us. Is it from God or our flesh. Are we listening for that still small voice or are we satisfying our own thoughts? How’s your altar?

 Job 27: 12-13 [Amp] He stills or stirs up the sea by His power, And by His understanding He smites proud Rehab. [13] By , His breath the heavens are garnished, His hand pierced the ( swiftly) fleeing serpent. [ Ps.33-6] By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all their host by the breath of His mouth. [ llPeter 3:5 ] For they willfully overlook and forget this ( fact) , that the heavens

 -There is no beginning or ending to God or His power. Our minds cannot comprehend such limitless power, we just know that He is and has more than enough, we have nothing to fear. 
 All of the earth is His 
And the fullness thereof 
He's everything that I need 
You can be sure of 
Jehovah Jirah He is my God 
 So why should I worry bout 
The highs and the lows

He is my El Shaddai 
He always looks out for me

 I am not afraid 
 6 Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering 
 So many Christians seem to be scared to death of the devil and hell. I have to ask this type of Christian a very, probably, rude question. Are you really a Christian or are you just acting like it? There is no reason for us to be afraid of the devil or hell. Jesus Christ ,in whom we believe , has already taken the keys to hell and defeated the devil on the cross. Really the devil can’t do anything to us unless we allow him to. People compare their lives to Job all the time but it is not a fair comparison for a lot of reasons but the most important one is that Jesus had not gone to the cross yet. We are never going to be sifted like Job because we don’t have to be. Most of our problems come from bad decisions and lack of discipline. We cannot blame the devil for that. Therefore I am not afraid of the devil or hell because I know that I have Jesus as my buckler and hell and the devil are naked before him. If I truly believe I have no fear rather an assurance of continual victory in Jesus.

Job 26:14 NLT 
 Despite the problems, Job never limits the power of God. Sometimes we unintentionally put up walls or limits to what we think God can do simply because we fear our own problem. But my God is bigger and greater than anything we could ever face - "My God is so big, so strong and so mighty, there's nothing my God cannot do!"

 Job 26 
 “Yet these are just the fringes of His ways [mere samples of His power], 
The faintest whisper of His voice! 
Who can contemplate the thunder of His [full] mighty power?” 
 God’s miraculous power ! His voice like thunder . Strength beyond our greatest imagination. Yet in one moment of time He reaches down and calms the clamor of the chaotic mind. He wipes the tears of the broken hearted . He says peace and all is still. What a miraculous God we serve. We can transcend His peace into others through the power of the Hy Ghost . A touch ,a word of confidence, a reassuring smile. Thank you Jesus that though your voice is like thunder and can shake Heaven and Earth yet so gentle as a whisper. 
You are more than enough. 
 IHe seen the tears as they fell down your face. 
The emptiness of your soul. 
Life had caused so much pain your mind seemed to be in sane. 
But you heard a voice that sounded like thunder and it’s Power was so great. There was no fear when you heard it for though powerful it was ever so gentle. 
He reached His hand down into the depth of your soul and said Am I not the One in control. 
Peace be still weary soul 
Insanity be gone this is not My will 
His voice like thunder roared with power 
His strength poured into me as being drenched in a summer’s shower. 
Oh how marvelous when He speaks so powerful yet so meek . 
Who can comprehend His ways ? 
All Glory and Power in Him displayed! 
 Psalms 29:4 
New International Version 
The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is majestic.

 Job recognized great power that God has but had failed to realize his authority in these moments. It's not enough to know God's power but you recognize his deity and authority to do as he pleases because whatever he chooses is right. This is the only place where Job failed, he trusted in his own righteousness over God's ability to allow hard times to come. When things come against us we must understand that God has things in control and that there is a purpose

 https://bible.com/bible/1/job.26.8-11.KJV 
 What it must feel like to have the power to create life from nothing. It is a power that we will never have nor get an understanding for. I know that I'm not God; I also know that nobody around me has exhibited that type of power. This is where I just lift my hands and say ok Lord I have no control over life. No matter the situation God can fix it and fill life with purpose. That doesn't mean that He can't use us to fulfill that purpose. Any one of His children can be used; God knows when and where to use somebody. Like here He is using Job ads an example of faith. No matter how many speak against the will of God; Job has rebuked them and pushed deeper into his faith of God. Jesus I thank you for building my faith.

Jesus responded, “Why are you afraid? You have so little faith!” Then he got up and rebuked the wind and waves, and suddenly there was a great calm. 
Matthew 8:26 NLT 
 https://bible.com/bible/116/mat.8.26.NLT 
 He is the almighty God! the wind and the sea obey his every command. He is always doing great things, we are only seeing a little glimpse of the things he can do in our lives, in this region, it was very encouraging what Brother Parker said last night. But that's not all God has for us, I dont think we've yet been able to tap in to the power that God has for us, if we are children of the King shouldnt we have the same power, we do, but we need faithfulness, and consistency in our relationship with God! He isnt going to allow us our inheritance unless he sees himself in us! Help me Lord to be faithfull in building my relationship with you!

 The sea represents life and it's uncertainty. The sea monster he references named Rahab. Rahab means chaos. So thank You, God for crushing the chaos and calming the uncertainty of our lives. When our lives are torrential and raging You are the peace that we need to man the waters. Thank You, God for Your hand on my life.

 Job is basically telling this feller (and I paraphrase it), "Hey, who are you helping…Who are you teaching Exploring God's Word to…Who are you reaching out to…Who are you mentoring?"

 What are you talking about? This is a question we ask. When we dont u understand what someone is saying. As we continue to grow in God, there should be some changes that take place in our speech. 
 Luke 6:45 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh. 
 Whatever is in your heart, your mouth will speak. This is why it is so imperative to keep our hearts right with God. For if we allow foolishness to come in, then foolishness will come out. But if we have the Word of God come in and be righteous in out thinking, then it will be His Word that comes out. Seek ye First the Kingdom. When I awake, when I fall asleep, seek ye first the Kingdom.

 14 Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand? 
 If you have just moved to Texas, just visiting Texas or have lived here your whole life, there is one thing that is unpredictable, ever-changing, and at times quite bi-polar. The Weather. 
 Through vicious storms, mighty winds, and blazing heat the weather has and can shake up the comfort of our lives. Loss of homes, materialistic items, and even friends or family. 
 Through chapter 26 Job is explaining just how much bigger God is then any storm. "He wraps the rain in thick clouds, and the clouds don't burst" vs.8 NLT. 
 It reminded me of Jesus calming a storm, by simply stating "Peace be still". 
 Yet, through all the examples, all the laid out information for us, who can truly understand the true thunder of His power? 
 Can we relate the unpredictable, ever-changing, and at times quite bi-polar Texas weather to the times and trials of our own lives? With the understanding, He will wrap up the rain and calm the storms of our lives. We don't always have to fully understand the true thunder of His power, we have to know God Can Do Anything.

 FIRST THE KINGDOM 
SEEKING 
 14 Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand? 
 The wisdom and knowledge of GOD is so great and grand that everything we know about HIM is only a part or portion of HIS ways. 
 Seeing this opportunity to SEEK and KNOW more about GOD we are invited to and intrigued to seek HIM. Therefore we foster and develop the life of SEEKING GOD through HIS Kingdom. 
 By SEEKING the FACE of GOD we will find HIS Heart (will) and HIS Hand (Favor). 
 The Hand of GOD can move any mountain, dry any sea, raise any dead, forgive any sin, heal any body, turn any situation, change any dilemma and use anybody. 
 Lets focus our hearts and lives on seeking JESUS and Kingdom to witness HIS ways and experience HIS thunder.

 In the Amplified Bible this lower portion of this chapter is entitled 
 The Greatness of Our God - Everything that we do should point to the greatness of who our God is. Even when we don't understand, which obviously Job didn't understand why he was being tested, we still must understand that God is still great! 
 The Greatness of Our God - Newsboys 
From the dawn of Creation 
This world has been cryin' out for hope 
For a hero to save us 
We long for the supernatural 
But there is only one God Who can save the day 
So clear the stage, prepare the way 
'Cause Heaven and Earth are singing 
 Glory, hallelujah, let the whole world see 
The greatness of our God 
In awesome wonder, He reigns forever 
We know the greatness of our God 
His pow'r is endless, He lives within us 
We know the greatness of our Go-o-o-od (Whoa-oa-oa-oa) 
The greatness of our God 
 There's no one above Him 
Only our Savior wears the crown 
There's none who can stop Him 
Not even the grave could hold Him down 
But there is only one King Who can save the day 
So clear the stage, prepare the way 
'Cause Heaven and Earth are singin' 
 Glory, hallelujah, let the whole world see 
The greatness of our God 
In awesome wonder, He reigns forever 
We know the greatness of our God

 12 He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud. 
 I think at one point of time or another, this is a test we all have to go through and grow through. Pride can easily slip in us all, if we are not careful. No one is exempt from going from Confidence to Pride.. in who we are in The Lord, or any position God has put us in. Whether it be at work, home life, leadership, business, or relationships. But one way God teaches us that we are wise in one way and foolish in another way… Is when he chasteneth us. Because it humbles us "Real Fast" in secret and sometimes in Public. I know I don't take it well when being punished by the Lord, but when he does chasten me because he loves me enough, not to let me stay in a foolish way of thinking or living. When the trial is "ALL" said and done, I end up saying "It Was Good For Me That I Was Afflicted" because he taught me, through experience as easily as he give it, he can easily take it away, By the power of his MIGHT. However, whatever lesson God gives me to learn the hard way, he eventually shows me mercy and blesses me afterwards for going through it and not losing my faith, that he will turn whatever was brought upon me around and make it work for my GOOD. For his anger endureth but a moment, and his FAVOUR is for a lifetime, Weeping May endure for a night but Joy comes in the morning. (Psalm 30:5) 
I think this was very truthful words spoken by JOB because he had to do some things to learn some things, and he had to Seek out God to know the thoughts of GOD towards mankind.

 Job made these statements broad enough to include not only himself, but also anyone else that Bildad and his friends failed to help. 
Job wondered who else had been damaged by the insensitivity and misapplied wisdom of his friends. 
 We have to be careful when someone comes and says they have a word from God for us. Not everyone has a word from God and they go by emotion. One thing I have learn in my walk with God is “ if the man of God (Pastor) doesn’t come to say he has a word, I am very careful in listen to others.” I am a strong believer that if God has a word for me, Pastor is the one who God will show him or give him what I need.

 Job 26:7-14 (nlt) 
7) God stretches the northern sky over empty space and hangs the earth on nothing. 
8) He wraps the rain in his thick clouds, and the clouds don't burst with the weight. 
9) He covers the face of the moon, shrouding it with his clouds. 
10) He created the horizon when he seperated the waters; he set the boundary between day and night. 
11) The foundations of heaven tremble; they shudder at his rebuke. 
12) By his power the sea grew calm. By his skill he crushed the great sea monster. 
13) His Spirit made the heavens beautiful, and his power pierced the gliding serpent. 
14) These are just the beginning of all that he does, merely a whisper of his power. Who, then, can comprehend the thunder of his power? 
 Jeremiah 32:17 says, "Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing to hard for thee." 
 Our God is the Creator of all things, and He is Omnipotent. He is All-Powerful. Although we may never be able to comprehend (grasp or understand) the Full-Power of God, we can be sure of one thing: "There is nothing to hard for God."

‭‭Job‬ ‭26:14‬ ‭NLT‬‬ 
 Job understood a lot about God, but he understood enough to know there was far more than he did not understand. 
 Job's description of the power of God is amazing and impressive; yet even Job knew that this description did not begin to fully describe God. 
 We can never fully understand God’s ways, we could never entirely describe His greatness. Yet the more time we spend with Him in prayer and in the Word, the more time we spend seeking Him, the closer we’ll get.

 Job 26 
 7b He hangeth the earth upon nothing. 
 
 
 He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them. 
 
 
 He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it. 
 
 
 He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end. 
 
 
 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof. 
 
 
 He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud. 
 
 
 By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent. 
 
 
 14b) the thunder of his power who can understand? 
 Our God can do anything! 
Praise Him!

 He spreads the skies over unformed space, hangs the earth out in empty space. He pours water into cumulus cloud-bags and the bags don’t burst. He makes the moon wax and wane, putting it through its phases. He draws the horizon out over the ocean, sets a boundary between light and darkness. Thunder crashes and rumbles in the skies. Listen! It’s God raising his voice! By his power he stills sea storms, by his wisdom he tames sea monsters. With one breath he clears the sky, with one finger he crushes the sea serpent. And this is only the beginning, a mere whisper of his rule. Whatever would we do if he really raised his voice!” 
Job 26:5‭-‬14 MSG 
 Wow!!!! And there are still people out there that say GOD does not exists. Baloney!!!! That is what i say!!! You must try and keep your didstance from people like this. 
 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. 
Genesis 1:1‭-‬4 KJV 
 We can see the beauty of GOD all around💖💖💖

 He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing. 
He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them. 
He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it. 
 God does things we can't even fathom. The Earth literally hangs from nothing. I remember when I first found out I was terrified, but then I realized that God had it all under control. Because he's God he can literally do anything. He still amazes me each and every day.

 But Job answered and said, 
 2 How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength? 
 3 How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?

 From the beginning of time God has set a boundary between light and darkness. We must uphold the boundaries that have been set and keep ourselves Holy before God. This chapter tells of some of the great mysteries of God. I'm so grateful that He hold back the sea from the land yet He still has enough time to hold my hand and hold me in the palm of His hands.

 God made everything oj this earth. We might think that something's dontvjave a reason, but God has a plan for everyone and everything. It is hurtful in Gods eyes when he sees us not respecting his work. God spent time for everything we have. We should always respect who and what he has put in our lives. That is why we always have to respect the house of God. We wa t new visitors to come and learn about our holy savior so we will all be praising him when the trumpet sounds. REACH OUT POFW!!!!!😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁

These are pretty harsh words coming from Job. It reminds me of what God said to him later. 
Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?

 14 Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand? 
 Jesus has so many things in store and planned for me. I may have not seen all God can do but I know He has it in store for me. Good thing about God is that everything is free. Jesus will never fail because he has everything.

 13 His Spirit made the heavens beautiful, and his power pierced the gliding serpent. (NLT) 
 The Creator of all things on earth also made everything beautiful in heaven. Without him nothing is created, including the serpent. God made the archangel, lucifer, to serve as the minister of praise. That same beauty of praise consumed him, and he desired to have place above God. This lead to his eviction from heaven. He is reduced to only reigning in worldly systems. This again is temporary for this false praise is coming to an end. The same Spirit that made him and the heavens is coming to overpowering to pierce the serpent. The power of God is moving, and looking for those who will praise him in the midst of the storm.

4 To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee? 
 Many times I have had to check my spirit, and check my attitude, as I have stepped into judgement against someone, and Jesus asks me just the few simple questions, rebuking me.

 “These are just the beginning of all that he does, merely a whisper of his power. Who, then, can comprehend the thunder of his power?””(‭‭Job‬ ‭26:14‬ ‭NLT‬‬) 
 Our God is the beginning and the end. He knows all things for his name is above all. He’s all powerful the omnipresent God he sees all things. There’s no one that can stop him for the darkness trembles when his presence is around.

Job 26:14 NLT 
 How great is your God? We know by knowledge that God is greater than anything that comes against us in opposition. But it is our minds and heart that act as a thumb in front of your eyes blocking the sun. We know the sun is the biggest star we see in our universe, but our thumbs in front of our eyes seem so big that it covers it. And all we see is the thumb of your problem, your giant thumb, your big thumb mountain that you cant seem to get over, its bigger and its blocking the Light to get to you. When your situation sticks out like a sore thumb all you see is how bad you have it. But the Word instructs us to fix our eyes on Jesus the author and finisher of our faith. Lift up your eyes unto the hills from whence comes your help. Your help comes from the Lord who made the heavens and the earth. Greater is our God. So we ought to get those hands and thumb from in front and raise them up in total surrender and worship and watch God act. Becuase now you know who really is great. 
 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle. 
Psalms 24:7‭-‬8 KJV

 Amen! God the all powerful and all mighty! Righteous and holy! Jesus is the only one that can make everything shift, move, stop. Not even the devil can do something without God letting it happen! When God moves somethings shifts and shakes!

 “Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.” 
‭‭Job‬ ‭26:6‬ ‭KJV‬‬ 
 Hell and destruction are uncovered. All is known, there is nothing hidden from God. When we walk with God he gives us an understanding of hell and destruction. We know that they bring death. And only Jesus bring light and life.

 2“How you have helped the powerless! How you have saved the weak! 
 Yes, we help by volunteering our time. Going to outreach, going to milk and bread, supporting the financial side for the community. But only if you volunteer, otherwise you're only an observer.
