 Job 23 
 1 Then Job answered and said, 
 2 Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning. 
 3 Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat! 
 4 I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments. 
 5 I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me. 
 6 Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me. 
 7 There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge. 
 8 Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him: 
 9 On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him: 
 10 But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. 
 11 My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined. 
 12 Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food. 
 13 But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth. 
 14 For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him. 
 15 Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him. 
 16 For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me: 
 17 Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face.

 One of the things they kept Job where he was during his storm what's his attitude during his turmoil. He constantly complained about how he didn't deserve what was going on. Sometimes when God is bringing us through a storm that's only meant to be short-term it can end up being lengthened because of our bitterness. Along with guarding our hearts and our minds we need to be very careful about the attitude that we have. Our attitude will determine are direction and actions ultimately.

 “But he knows where I am going. And when he tests me, I will come out as pure as gold. For I have stayed on God’s paths; I have followed his ways and not turned aside. I have not departed from his commands, but have treasured his words more than daily food. 
Job 23:10‭-‬12 NLT 
 https://bible.com/bible/116/job.23.10-12.NLT 
 God takes us through the fire, but it's not to weaken us. It is to strengthen us. The fire is used for many things. It removes impurities, it refines, it strengthens, it molds and shapes. When we go through struggles we should count it as a joy. God's at work in our lives. What are You teaching me, Lord? Take me to the next level.

 8 Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:

 10 But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. 
 Sometimes that when we go through trials and tribulations, we find out whom we can count on and who we can’t. I have found that in the 29 years living for God, there have been times that I have felt exactly how Job is describing his own situation. There have been times where family and friends could not walk through the circumstances for me, it was a time that I have been the loneliest and then as I was coming through I knew I had God walking right beside me. He was there from the beginning and he is there right now. 
 Even when I don’t feel him, he is working 
Even when I don’t see him, he is working. 
 He is a way maker 
He is a promise keeper 
He is a miracle worker 
He is a light in the darkness 
That is who he is. 
 I know he is the hand that guides me and when he is done I’m stronger, I’m more intense to praise him and most of all he has reconciled me unto himself. He never leaves nor forsakes us. That is why it is so important to seek first the kingdom of God so that there will never be a moment of loneliness. 
 I love the Kingdom!

 Verses 10-12 MSG “But he knows where I am and what I’ve done. He can cross-examine me all he wants, and I’ll pass the test with honors. I’ve followed him closely, my feet in his footprints, not once swerving from his way. I’ve obeyed every word he’s spoken, and not just obeyed his advice—I’ve treasured it." Even though it seems that we maybe going through some storms in our life, we just need to remember "God knows". God will bring you through and notice to the devil "Devil if you only knew what I was gonna be after the storm, You wouldn't have even bothered me" as the song "I Want It All Back" says.

 Job 23 
“Even today my complaint is contentious; 
His hand is heavy despite my groaning. 
3 
“Oh, that I knew where I might find Him, 
That I might [even] come to His seat! 
4 
“I would present my cause before Him 
And fill my mouth with arguments. 
5 
“I would learn the words which He would answer, 
And understand what He would say to me. 
6 
“Would He contend against me with His great power? 
No, surely He would give attention to me. 
 There is no greater friend like Jesus . 
Job was able to bear his heart to God . He makes a declaration that God would give attention to him. His friends had pretty much buried him with their words. Job did not allow their continuing outting him down keep him from proclaiming God’s love. He knew God was there . Though He seemed a long ways off and Job felt as if He could not find him. He knew that God would give him time and attention. 
Oh that we will be mindful of those who need just a gentle touch an assurance God is right there. Even when we do not get an answer it can’t hear His voice. 
Revival of the soul of man or woman when all seems to be lost. In Jesus name!

Job 23:8‭-‬12 KJV 
 https://bible.com/bible/1/job.23.8-12.KJV 
 There have been times that I felt like I couldn't see him, but was it that I couldn't see God or was it I didn't want to see God. You know that when we can't see the King of kings; it's because of something that we have done. Remember God will never leave or forsake us. We are His children. Now that doesn't mean that He won't let us go through things on our own. The power of free will; once we chose to go through the storm; it's the reward on the other end that counts. Each time I try to do something on my own: it never works out. Once I put it in God's hands; everything begins to fall into place. I don't know exactly how to put it in words, but know this. The Father has us all; it's what we do with it that will shape us on the potter's wheel. I wan to be putty in God's hands; I can do it on my own, but why would I when I have a Father that can put my steps and actions into order. Thank you Jesus for ordering my life this day.

 For I have stayed on God’s paths; I have followed his ways and not turned aside. I have not departed from his commands, but have treasured his words more than daily food. But once he has made his decision, who can change his mind? Whatever he wants to do, he does. So he will do to me whatever he has planned. He controls my destiny. No wonder I am so terrified in his presence. When I think of it, terror grips me. God has made me sick at heart; the Almighty has terrified me. 
Job 23:11‭-‬16 NLT 
 https://bible.com/bible/116/job.23.11-16.NLT 
 God Chos3 Job for a reason, The bible said to fear God, but being terrified is a whole nother thing! It is hard to put all your trust in God, I have to, and to do that I literally have to tell myself I dont trust myself , but I trust God , I know me, I have to be real with me! I have to Give it ALL to God, because I know .e and I will try to control! It's easy to go through all your wrongs and know that your wrong, but when your not, and you know your not wrong, you literally have to find everything good, you have to say ok Lord I dont know what is going on. Honestly if I wouldn't have known that Job was innocent from the start, I would have Ben like "what did he do wrong" because we never think that this was only a test!

 ““But he knows where I am going. And when he tests me, I will come out as pure as gold. For I have stayed on God’s paths; I have followed his ways and not turned aside.” 
‭‭Job‬ ‭23:10-11‬ ‭NLT‬‬ 
 Going through a test or trial is scary sometimes. You don’t what’s gonna happen how long this test will last and how far it’s gonna go. Job says he just stays on the path of God and follow his ways then immediately after says not turned aside. When we follow his ways and stay on his path then not turning aside doesn’t become really an option if your head is straight forward seeing the light at the end of the struggle. 
 Be blessed in Jesus name

 Psalm 42: 
1. As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. 
 2. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God? 
 3. My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God? 
 Job and David seem to be having the same feelings - longing for God more than food or water, but can’t seem to find Him, but it’s like the little saying goes…even in school, the teacher is quiet during the test.

 God’s got a plan for us. Even through test until we pass them we will go through them sometimes in the same or different forms. Job kept a great attitude throughout the whole thing and never turned away from God though his “friends” and others said otherwise. We need to realize who is in charge of our destiny. Be blessed today and stay close to God, He will never leave nor forsake you.

 FIRST THE KINGDOM 
SEEKING 
 3 Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat! 
 Seeking GOD is a lifelong process. He grants us enough revelation to know HIM, but we know there is much more to HIM. Job speaks for many of us on this desirous journey of HIS Kingdom. There are times and situations that compel us to focus closer, push farther, dig deeper and seek passionately. 
 My prayer today is that I will seek JESUS like determination whether I face a crisis or enjoy a blessing. In times of peril it is common to feel like we are absent from HIM, lost without HIM and desperate for HIM. 
 This verse for me paints a vivid picture of what it means to "SEEK" the King and HIS Kingdom. As the apostle put it: 
 Hebrews 4:16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. 
 It is the will of GOD that we are SEEKING HIM and approaching HIS seat.

 When you’re discouraged, don’t go to sin for comfort. Sin leads to an eternal death. Go to Jesus. He will add to your strength, guide your steps, and give you peace IF you let Him.

 A true test of your faith. 
 10 But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. 
11 My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined. 
 It's easy to live for God when we see what He is doing. It is easy to see what He is doing when there are so many great and wonderful miracles and blessings happening around us. Yet, the test comes when all hope is lost, when there is no food in the pantry, when the car has an orange light that means no gas, when the job says we no longer are in need of your services. How then, will you respond? Will it be out of anger, because God is suppose to take care of us? Will it be out of fear, because we are not in control? How would you respond to these situations? Although Job, felt many of these, he still understood that God was in control. And his faith was strong enough to know that if God was done with him, that he would take off. Job knew that he did his best for God. 
When we seek after God and His Kingdom, we must do so with a heart of oneness, that the Kingdom should be the first thing we think of. When our altars are built and ready, we must sacrifice to Him.

2 Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.

6 Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me. 
7 There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge. 
 Job continued to feel desperate. The wisdom and counsel of Eliphaz and the others was of no relief to him, and just made his mental and spiritual agony worse. 
Job felt separated from God. Surely, this was not the first crisis in his life (though, of course, it was far beyond any previous suffering). He had found comfort and solace in God in prior times, but in this catastrophe he felt he could not find God. 
 In a way almost infinitely less, yet nevertheless real, Job experienced what Jesus experienced on the cross: A man who had previously been in the fellowship and favor of God, now felt utterly forsaken. This was the greatest source of torment in Job’s life. 
This not only tells us of Job’s sense of the loss of the presence of God, but of his longing to have it back. “Good men are washed towards God even by the rough waves of their grief; and when their sorrows are deepest, their highest desire is not to escape from them, but to get Closer to God.

 Job 23:10-11 [Amp] But He knows the way that I take [ He has concern for it , predicates, and pays attention to it]. When He has tried me, I shall come fourth as refined gold [ pure and luminous]. 
[11] My foot has held fast to His steps; His ways have I kept and turned aside. [ Ps.17 :3 ] You have proved my heart; You have visited me in the night; You have tried me and find nothing [ no evil] purpose in me]; I have purposed that my mouth shall transgress. For you, O God, have proved us; as silver is tried, refined, and purified. Blessed happy to be envied is the man who is patient under trail and stands up under temptation. For when He has stood the test and been approved, He or she will receive the victor's crown of life which God has promised to those who love Him. Through all trails we must hang on to our Lord because we are overcommers and victorious. And we have a promise and a purpose from him.

 Trials from the Lord have a purpose, they prune off things that shouldn’t be there and add character or integrity that should be there. In other words, it will accomplish what he designs it to do. However, some things are just life and we must discern a trial from the flat tires of life.

 MSG - 8-9 “I travel East looking for him—I find no one; 
then West, but not a trace; 
I go North, but he’s hidden his tracks; 
then South, but not even a glimpse. 
10-12 “But he knows where I am and what I’ve done. 
He can cross-examine me all he wants, and I’ll pass the test 
with honors. 
I’ve followed him closely, my feet in his footprints, 
not once swerving from his way. 
I’ve obeyed every word he’s spoken, 
and not just obeyed his advice—I’ve treasured it. 
 Many times we feel like we are all alone in the middle of a trial and no one is listening to us or even sees where we are. But have no fear, JESUS is always with us. We have the promise in HIS word that He will never leave us nor forsake. 
 Sometimes we just have to go through things when we must encourage ourselves and let the enemy know that God has trusted enough to go through this dark, lonely place and that we will come through a WINNER! 
 If God be for us who can be against us!

3 Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat! 
Sometimes it feels like we are a million miles away from Jesus. This makes us think that we have done something to remove ourselves from Him. I truly believe that this is not always the case. Anyone can do what's right when the presence of God is so very strong, but not everyone can do what is right when it feels like Jesus is a million miles away. We have to keep our integrity no matter what the situation is… Job said he would pay God a visit if he could find Him. 
 He said he would never leave us nor forsake us. He is always with us and just because we don't feel Him doest mean we have done something bad.

 Well, my first blog seems to have disappeared, so here is the short version. 
 He will certainly accomplish what He has decreed for me, and He has many more things like these in mind. 
Job 23:14 HCSB 
 For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord , thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you. And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart. 
Jeremiah 29:11‭-‬13 KJV 
 God is thinking about me, and He always has a plan. In my weariness with the battle, I must cling to His promises. His Word will sustain me. He has brought me through before, and this, too, shall pass. My suffering here is temporary (life is a vapor), but His promises are eternal. I can do all things through Christ. He is for me. I am not alone. He has an expected end for me, that even when He is silent, I can find in His Book.

 God is terrible and powerful but he is kind and loving too. There are times when he swallows up the children of Kora in the earth and there are times when he loves us so much he endured the cross. When we come to God as his children, we should not come in fear that he will work against us but we should know that his purpose is to help us and to make us stronger in him. Sometimes for him to do that it feels like a beat down and even though you don’t understand it right now, I have been through this enough now to understand that you will understand it on the other side looking back at the situation. We just have to trust him enough to keep moving forward even when we don’t know where we are going . He is victorious in the end so I’m going to stick with him.

 “No wonder I am so terrified in his presence. When I think of it, terror grips me. God has made me sick at heart; the Almighty has terrified me. Darkness is all around me; thick, impenetrable darkness is everywhere.”

 Living holy becomes a challenge when we give in to sin. The bible declares the way of a transgressor is hard. We must not allow sin to lead us, but allow the word of God to guide us to where he wants us to go. Our life is in his hand and he can do whatever is best in our life.

 Gold has to be refined and put through the fire, only then does all the attached minerals fall off. In the same way, when we are tried by trials and tribulations it purifies us. Going through the fire is painful but it burns those thing we have been holding on to, and do not need. The process means we will come out as pure gold.

 9 On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:

 We must keep the mindset that Jesus is working on us, and he knows what we need.

 11 My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined. 
 12 Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food. 
 What an example.. to live and walk by the Word of God. Oh that we may get this kind of desperation for His Word. That we may live according to all his statutes and commands. The are not to rob us of liberty but on the contrary to enjoy the full benefits of the freedom we have in Christ.

 “Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him: On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:” 
‭‭Job‬ ‭23:8-9‬ ‭KJV‬‬ 
 Our walk with God is so much more than we can see. It’s more than what we perceive. We don’t always know where he is, but he is there. He loves us too much to let us just go without watching and waiting. Even when we can’t see him or feel him, he is working. He never stops working.

 Whenever a test comes I always remind myself, "My God does all things well!" We may not understand or know where exactly we're headed but if we trust Him, the reward of His glory will always be more than enough.

 3 If only I knew where to find God, I would go to his court. 
 Many ask this question to themselves. Where is God when I needed him? They feel that God has left them because they are going through a hardship. God is always there, whether you're going through hard or good times. Praise God no matter what the situation is.
