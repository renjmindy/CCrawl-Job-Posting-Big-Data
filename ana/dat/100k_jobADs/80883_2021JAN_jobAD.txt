 Fired for storming the Capitol? Why most workers aren’t protected for what they do on their own time

 Can you be fired for joining a violent mob that storms the Capitol? 
 Of course you can. 
 Among the jarring images of white insurrectionists who broke into the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 was a  man marching through the building holding a Trump flag  with his work ID badge still draped around his neck. 
 It didn’t take long for internet sleuths to zoom in on the badge and alert his employer, Navistar Direct Marketing, a Maryland direct mail printing company. 
 The company promptly fired the man and contacted the FBI,  issuing a statement  that “any employee demonstrating dangerous conduct that endangers the health and safety of others will no longer have an employment opportunity.” 
 Even though the Capitol Police let  all but 14 of the rioters  walk away, the FBI and District of Columbia police have begun  tracking them  down.  Other   companies  have also  taken action   against employees  identified in the many photos from inside the Capitol. Even the  CEO of a data analytics firm  found himself without a job following his arrest. 
 Based on  my experience as a law professor  and lawyer specializing in employment law, I doubt that Navistar management is losing sleep over whether its decision was legally justified. 
 It’s not even a close case. Non-unionized workers in the United States – about  90% of all workers  – are employed at-will. That  means you can be terminated at any time , without notice, for any reason. It doesn’t even have to be a good reason. Unless the company has guaranteed your job in writing, or there is a specific law that protects your conduct – such as laws protecting union organizing or whistleblowing – your fate is up to them. 
 The law is more protective when it comes to unionized workers and government employees. These workers may  have the right  to be terminated only for cause, and they might get a hearing process prior to being disciplined. Government workers are also protected by the First Amendment, particularly when it comes to free speech in their  capacity as citizens  rather than speech related to the workplace. 
 That’s why the teachers and off-duty police officers spotted at the Capitol have only been  suspended pending investigations , rather than fired outright. For these workers, their fate may depend on whether they were peacefully participating in the day’s earlier rally – an activity that would be considered protected speech – as opposed to engaging in violence or joining the capitol invasion, which would be unprotected illegal conduct. 
 Things get murky if these government workers were displaying white supremacist symbols, like a confederate flag, at the rally.  Courts have recognized limits  on the public speech of police officers to uphold public confidence, community relations and department morale.

 But as the Brennan Center, a liberal-leaning law and public policy institute, observed in an  August 2020 report , “few law enforcement agencies have policies that specifically prohibit affiliating with white supremacist groups.” The absence of such policies could make it harder for departments to later discipline off-duty police officers for their role. 
 [  Deep knowledge, daily.   Sign up for The Conversation’s newsletter .] 
 State lawmakers  who participated  are a different matter. Because they were elected by the people, they can’t be removed like ordinary employees. That  might require  a recall election or a state impeachment process. 
 But for most of the folks who snapped selfies in the Capitol – or ended up in someone else’s – if they don’t get a knock on the door from the FBI, they may soon be getting one from HR.

 Are you burnt out at work? Ask yourself these 4 questions 
 Posted on  June 6, 2019  by  particularkev 
 In today’s digital age, we’re losing the ability to switch off from our work.

 It’s normal to feel stressed at work from time to time. But for some people, the stress becomes all-consuming, leading to exhaustion, cynicism and hatred towards your job. This is known as burnout. 
 Burnout used to be classified as a  problem related to life management , but last week the World Health Organisation  re-labelled the syndrome  as an “occupational phenomenon” to better reflect that burnout is a work-based syndrome caused by chronic stress. 
 The newly listed dimensions of burnout are: 
 
 feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion 
 increased mental distance from one’s job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one’s job 
 reduced professional efficacy (work performance).

 In the era of smartphones and 24-7 emails, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to switch off from the workplace and from those who have power over us. 
 The new definition of burnout should be a wake-up call for employers to treat chronic stress that has not been successfully managed as a work health and safety issue. 
 How do you know if you’re burnt out? 
 If you think you might be suffering burnout, ask yourself the following questions: 
 
 
 has anyone close to you asked you to cut down on your work? 
 
 
 in recent months have you become angry or resentful about your work or about colleagues, clients or patients? 
 
 
 do you feel guilty that you are not spending enough time with your friends, family or even yourself? 
 
 
 do you find yourself becoming increasingly emotional, for example crying, getting angry, shouting, or feeling tense for no obvious reason? 
 
 
 If you answered yes to any of these questions, it might be time for change. 
 These questions were devised for the  United Kingdom Practitioner Health Programme  and are a good starting point for all workers to identify if you are at risk of burning out. 
 (You can also complete the British Medical Association’s  online burnout questionnaire , although it’s tailored for doctors so the drop-down menu will ask you to select a medical specialty). 
 If you think you’re suffering burnout, the first step is to talk to your line manager or workplace counsellor. Many workplaces now also have confidential external psychologists as part of their  employee assistance programme .

 What causes burnout? 
 We all have different levels of capacity to cope with emotional and physical strains. 
 When we  exceed our ability to cope , something has to give; the body becomes stressed if you push yourself either mentally or physically beyond your capacity.

 People who burn out  often feel  a sense of emotional exhaustion or indifference, and may treat colleagues, clients or patients in a detached or dehumanised way. They become distant from their job and lose the zeal for their chosen career. 
 They might become cynical, less effective at work, and lack the desire for personal achievement. In the long term, this is not helpful for the person or the organisation. 
 While burnout isn’t a mental health disorder, it can lead to more  serious issues  such as family breakdowns, chronic fatigue syndrome, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and  alcohol and drug abuse . 
 Who is most at risk? 
 Any worker who deals with people has the potential to suffer from burnout. This might include teachers, care workers, prison officers or retail staff. 
 Emergency service workers – such as police, paramedics, nurses and doctors –  are at even higher risk  because they continually work in high-stress conditions. 
 A  recent survey  of 15,000 US doctors found 44% were experiencing symptoms of burnout. As one neurologist explained: 
 
 I dread coming to work. I find myself being short when dealing with staff and patients. 
 
 French research on  hospital emergency department staff  found one in three (34%) were burnt out because of excessive workloads and high demands for care. 
 When you’re close to burnout, there’s a fine line between coping and not coping.

 Lawyers are another profession vulnerable to burnout. In a  survey  of 1,000 employees of a renowned London law firm, 73% of lawyers expressed feelings of burnout and 58% put this down to the need for a better work-life balance. 
 No matter what job you do, if you are pushed beyond your ability to  cope  for long periods of time, you’re likely to suffer burnout. 
 It’s OK to say no to more work 
 Employers have an organisational obligation to promote staff well-being and ensure staff aren’t overworked, overstressed, and headed towards burnout. 
 There are things we can all do to reduce our own risk of burnout. One is to boost our levels of resilience. This means we’re  able to respond to stress  in a healthy way and can bounce back after challenges and grow stronger in the process.

 Corporate resilience training works – but what are we being asked to bear?

 You can build your resilience by learning to switch off, setting boundaries for your work, and thinking more about play. As much as you can, inoculate yourself against job interference and prevent it from ebbing into your personal life. 
 No matter what your profession, don’t let your job become the only way you define yourself as a person. 
 And if your job is making you miserable, consider moving jobs or at least have a look at what else is out there. You may surprise yourself. 
 If you or anyone you know needs help or support, you can call Lifeline  on 13 11 14.

 Three charts on: job prospects for refugees in Australia

 While refugees will always face major challenges in making the transition to employment, new  research  indicates their job prospects improve the longer they are in Australia. 
 But for those who do find work, it’s not always in their chosen profession. Most are in low-skilled occupations. 
 The  Building a New Life in Australia study  is longitudinal, following the journey of almost 2,400 humanitarian migrants, including refugees and asylum seekers, from their arrival in Australia or when granted a permanent visa. The participants come from 35 countries and speak close to 50 languages. 
 Some 89% have experienced significant trauma such as war and persecution. Most have arrived in Australia with little or no English, and many had their schooling interrupted. 
 The challenge of finding work 
 At the first interview for the study (three to six months after arrival for most), 6% of participants aged 18-64 were in paid employment. This had risen to 16% around one year later (during wave 2) and 23% two years later (wave 3). This is a four-fold increase between the first and third interviews. 
 
 https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/RgyUZ/8/ 
 
 Employment rates for men were higher than for women, with 36% of men in paid work at wave three compared to 8% of women.  Many women  take on family and caring obligations in the early years of settlement, which partly explains their lower rates of employment. 
 We found searching for a job can be challenging and time-consuming for many humanitarian migrants. 
 Most participants had been in Australia for only a few months at the first interview. Over 80% of those job seekers found it hard to get a job. Consistent with previous research, humanitarian migrants’ employment is expected to gradually increase as they spend more time in Australia. 
 Importantly, humanitarian migrants in Australia  seem to be entrepreneurs , showing  higher-than-average  engagement in small and medium-sized business. 
 
 https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nspuB/9/ 
 
 One of the most challenging factors associated with employment is English proficiency. Not surprisingly, participants with good understanding of spoken English were much more likely to be employed. 
 However, there are  other barriers  to employment. These include lack of Australian experience and ongoing discrimination against certain ethnic groups in the labour market. For example,  research  has shown that African and Middle Eastern refugees had poorer employment outcomes than ex-Yugoslavs despite having similar levels of knowledge, skills and qualifications. 
 So  educating  employers on the skills of humanitarian migrants may be worthwhile. 
 What jobs can refugees get? 
 Even though more humanitarian migrants are finding jobs, certain areas remain a challenge. Our analysis shows some evidence of what is known as “ occupational skidding ”. 
 That is when humanitarian migrants cannot obtain jobs in line with their skills and qualifications. Think of the stereotypical surgeon who ends up working as a taxi driver in their new country. 
 The following chart shows a decline in the proportion of 18-64-year-olds working as managers and professionals, after arriving in Australia. 
 
 https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/KUMPJ/6/ 
 
 As you can see from the data, the most common occupations among humanitarian migrants were labouring (37% at wave 1, 36% at wave 2, and 42% at wave 3) followed by technicians/trades (29%, 26% and 22%). 
 This contrasts starkly with pre-migration occupations, where sizeable percentages were working in professional occupations (21%) and technicians/trades were most common (28%). Examples of professional occupations include engineers, teachers, doctors and lawyers. 
 There were almost as many managers as there were labourers prior to migration (11% and 16%). By the time of the third interview, no participants reported working in managerial positions. 
 Previous Australian  research  shows there are niches (cleaning, aged care, meat processing, taxi driving, security and building) where humanitarian migrants tend to find employment and that the process for recognising skills can be difficult in Australia. 
 Employment prospects improve over time 
 The longer humanitarian migrants spend in Australia, the more likely they are to find employment. Despite some improvements, many still struggle to obtain work in Australia commensurate with their previous skills and qualifications. This is also a problem in other resettlement countries such as  Canada  and  Sweden . 
 The Australian government is piloting the  Careers Pathways Pilot for Humanitarian Entrants  and has recently launched a new  Humanitarian Settlement Program . 
 We expect these programs will improve outcomes as employment helps to create new social and professional networks, improve English skills and can lead to financial independence.

 Cricket: The Ashes Report - 15 July 2013 
 Posted on  July 15, 2013  by  particularkev 
 In the end it was a very close match that England won and Australia lost. The first test of the current Ashes series is over with plenty of controversy and action a plenty. It was a great game, though sadly it will be remembered for the controversy surrounding the DRS as much as for the game itself. But having said that, Australia really did a bad job in the way it used the DRS system, while England handled the DRS masterfully and full credit to them. With just 14 runs between the two sides, the second test has a lot to live up to following this match. 
 I can't really make any useful comments on the English team, but as far as Australia is concerned I think it is time for Ed Cowan to be shown the door and for David Warner to return. Failing the return of Warner, who I believe has been sent to Africa with Australia A for some batting practice, perhaps it is time for the return of Usman Khawaja. The Australian batsmen really need to lift their game, because in reality the match was a lot closer than it should have been and they have the lower order to thanks for that - particularly the bowlers. 
 As for the bowling effort - work needs to be done also. There was far too much waywardness in the fast bowling ranks. Thankfully Nathan Lyon should be banished to the sidelines given the performance of Ashton Agar - a spinner who actually spins the ball and he can bat, which is very handy in the absence of a reliable upper order.

 Australia: Kevin Rudd Has Resigned as Foreign Minister 
 Posted on  February 22, 2012  by  particularkev 
 The Foreign Minister, Kevin Rudd, has resigned. Will he now challenge the Prime Minister and try and get his old job back? One thing is for sure, despite the rhetoric coming from Julia Gillard and her supporters, Kevin Rudd is not to blame for the woes of the ALP government. Sure, they can use Kevin Rudd as a scapegoat as they are attempting to do, but everyone knows that the Gillard led government is something of a joke and they have no chance of winning the next election. 
 To win the next election there needs to be change and that has to start with the leadership. Simon Crean is not the answer - which appears to be something that has been suggested in recent days. That would be a very poor choice. As much as some members of the government would hate it, I do believe as many do, that Kevin Rudd is the best chance the ALP has of winning the next election, whenever that may be. That is my own opinion of course, but to do so (win I mean), he would have to a much better job than he did last time and actually govern.

 Plinky Prompt: The Most Important Thing I Learned This Year 
 Posted on  December 31, 2011  by  particularkev 
 Interesting, 01 
 This will be a lesson I should have learnt some time ago, but seemingly forgot. It's a really simple lesson really, though apparently easily forgotten. Simply put - don't over commit at work. Certainly, work to the appropriate level, not denying that - just don't over do it. What I mean is, putting in a heap of extra hours doesn't do your health any good - physically, mentally, etc. So keep the job in perspective and in balance with the rest of life.

 Plinky Prompt: Name One of the Best Decisions You've Ever Made 
 Posted on  December 29, 2011  by  particularkev 
 resignation 
 One of the best decisions I have made, if not the best, was to resign from my job after 20 years of work there. I moved on and now work in a lesser paid job - however, my health has improved across the board as a result and I am far happier now than I was back then. I no longer work the excessive hours and have more time to do my own thing. What's not to like.

 Christian Woman Freed from Muslim Kidnappers in Pakistan 
 Posted on  March 19, 2011  by  particularkev 
 Captors tried to force mother of seven to convert to Islam. 
 LAHORE, Pakistan, March 11 (CDN)  — A Christian mother of seven here who last August was kidnapped, raped, sold into marriage and threatened with death if she did not convert to Islam was freed this week. 
 After she refused to convert and accept the marriage, human traffickers had threatened to kill Shaheen Bibi, 40, and throw her body into the Sindh River if her father, Manna Masih, did not pay a ransom of 100,000 rupees (US$1,170) by Saturday (March 5), the released woman told Compass. 
 Drugged into unconsciousness, Shaheen Bibi said that when she awoke in Sadiqabad, her captors told her she had been sold and given in marriage. 
 “I asked them who they were,” she said. “They said that they were Muslims, to which I told them that I was a married Christian woman with seven children, so it was impossible for me to marry someone, especially a Muslim.” 
 Giving her a prayer rug (musalla), her captors – Ahmed Baksh, Muhammad Amin and Jaam Ijaz – tried to force her to convert to Islam and told her to recite a Muslim prayer, she said. 
 “I took the musalla but prayed to Jesus Christ for help,” she said. “They realized that I should be returned to my family.” 
 A member of St. Joseph Catholic Church in Lahore, Shaheen Bibi said she was kidnapped in August 2010 after she met a woman named Parveen on a bus on her way to work. She said Parveen learned where she worked and later showed up there in a car with two men identified as Muhammad Zulfiqar and Shah. They offered her a job at double her salary and took her to nearby Thokar Niaz Baig. 
 There she was given tea with some drug in it, and she began to fall unconscious as the two men raped her, she said. Shaheen Bibi was unconscious when they put her in a vehicle, and they gave her sedation injections whenever she regained her senses, she said. 
 When she awoke in Sadiqabad, Baksh, Amin and Ijaz informed her that she had been sold into marriage with Baksh. They showed her legal documents in which she was given a Muslim name, Sughran Bibi daughter of Siddiq Ali. After Baksh had twice raped her, she said, his mother interjected that she was a “persistent Christian” and that therefore he should stay away from her. 
 Shaheen Bibi, separated from an abusive husband who had left her for another woman, said that after Baksh’s mother intervened, her captors stopped hurting her but kept her in chains. 
 Release 
 Her father, Masih, asked police to take action, but they did nothing as her captors had taken her to a remote area between the cities of Rahim Yar Khan and Sadiqabad, considered a “no-go” area ruled by dangerous criminals. 
 Masih then sought legal assistance from the Community Development Initiative (CDI), a human rights affiliate of the European Center for Law & Justice. With the kidnappers giving Saturday (March 5) as a deadline for payment of the ransom, CDI attorneys brought the issue to the notice of high police officials in Lahore and on March 4 obtained urgent legal orders from Model Town Superintendent of Police Haidar Ashraf to recover Shaheen, according to a CDI source. 
 The order ultimately went to Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) Asghar Jutt of the Nashtar police station. Police accompanied by a CDI field officer raided the home of a contact person for the captors in Lahore, Naheed Bibi, the CDI source said, and officers arrested her in Awami Colony, Lahore. 
 With Naheed Bibi along, CDI Field Officer Haroon Tazeem and Masih accompanied five policemen, including ASI Jutt, on March 5 to Khan Baila, near Rahim Yar Khan – a journey of 370 miles, arriving that evening. Area police were not willing to cooperate and accompany them, telling them that Khan Baila was a “no-go area” they did not enter even during daytime, much less at night. 
 Jutt told area police that he had orders from high officials to recover Shaheen Bib, and that he and Tazeem would lead the raid, the CDI source said. With Nashtar police also daring them to help, five local policemen decided to go with them for the operation, he said. 
 At midnight on Sunday (March 6), after some encounters and raids in a jungle area where houses are miles apart, the rescue team managed to get hold of Shaheen Bibi, the CDI source said. The captors handed over Shaheen Bibi on the condition that they would not be the targets of further legal action, the CDI source said. 
 Sensing that their foray into the danger zone had gone on long enough, Tazeem and Jutt decided to leave but told them that those who had sold Shaheen Bib in Lahore would be brought to justice. 
 Fatigued and fragile when she arrived in Lahore on Monday (March 7), Shaheen Bibi told CDN through her attorneys that she would pursue legal action against those who sold her fraudulently into slavery and humiliation. 
 She said that she had been chained to a tree outside a house, where she prayed continually that God would help her out of the seemingly impossible situation. After the kidnappers gave her father the March 5 deadline last week, Shaheen Bibi said, at one point she lifted her eyes in prayer, saw a cross in the sky and was comforted that God’s mighty hand would release her even though her father had no money to pay ransom. 
 On four previous occasions, she said, her captors had decided to kill her and had changed their mind. 
 Shaheen Bibi said there were about 10 other women in captivity with her, some whose hands or legs were broken because they had refused to be forcibly given in marriage. Among the women was one from Bangladesh who had abandoned hope of ever returning home as she had reached her 60s in captivity. 
 Masih told CDN that he had prayed that God would send help, as he had no money to pay the ransom. The day before the deadline for paying the ransom, he said, he had 100 rupees (less than US$2) in his pocket.

 Plinky Prompt: What does your Fitness Routine Consist of? 
 Posted on  January 29, 2011  by  particularkev 
 Dumbbell 
 My fitness routine - ha ha ha. Actually, I do have one, or at least will soon have one again. It has been difficult to get back into that following my car accident 3 years ago. 
 Currently it consists of a lot of 'cardio' via my job. I also cycle to and from work each day (5 days a week) and the bike is also my means of transport about town (I don't have a car). 
 I'm about to get back into the weights with my home gym set up. I have a regime that I'll be following 4 nights a week.

 Muslims Force Expat Christian Teacher to Flee Maldives 
 Posted on  October 9, 2010  by  particularkev 
 Mistaking compass she drew for a cross, parents of students threatened to expel her. 
 NEW DELHI, October 5 (CDN)  — Authorities in the Maldives last week had to transport a Christian teacher from India off one of the Islamic nation’s islands after Muslim parents of her students threatened to expel her for “preaching Christianity.” 
 On Wednesday night (Sept. 29) a group of angry Muslim parents stormed the government school on the island of Foakaindhoo, in Shaviyani Atoll, accusing Geethamma George of drawing a cross in her class, a source at Foakaindhoo School told Compass. 
 “There were only 10 teachers to defend Geethamma George when a huge crowd gathered outside the school,” the source said by telephone. “Numerous local residents of the island also joined the parents’ protest.” 
 The school administration promptly sought the help of officials from the education ministry. 
 “Fearing that the teacher would be physically attacked, the officials took her out of the island right away,” the source said. “She will never be able to come back to the island, and nor is she willing to do so. She will be given a job in another island.” 
 A few days earlier, George, a social studies teacher, had drawn a compass to teach directions to Class VI students. But the students, who knew little English, mistook the drawing to be a cross and thought she was trying to preach Christianity, the source said. The students complained to their parents, who in turn issued a warning to the school. 
 Administrators at the school set up a committee to investigate the allegation and called for a meeting with parents on Thursday (Sept. 30) to present their findings. The committee found that George had drawn a compass as part of a geography lesson. 
 “However, the parents arrived the previous night to settle the matter outside the school,” said the source. 
 According to local newspaper Haveeru, authorities transferred George to the nearby island of Funadhoo “after the parents threatened to tie and drag her off of the island.” 
 The teacher, who worked at the school for three years, is originally from the south Indian coastal state of Kerala. Many Christians from Kerala and neighboring Tamil Nadu state in India are working as teachers and doctors in the Maldives. 
 Preaching or practicing a non-Muslim faith is forbidden under Maldivian law, which does not recognize any faith other than Islam. The more than 300,000 citizens of the Maldives are all Sunni Muslims. 
 A string of 1,190 islands in the Indian Ocean off Sri Lanka in South Asia, the Maldives is the only country after Saudi Arabia that claims to have a 100 percent Muslim population. As per its constitution, only a Muslim can be a citizen of the country. Importing any literature that contradicts Islam is against the law. 
 Many of the more than 70,000 expatriate workers in the Maldives are Christian, but they are allowed to practice their faith only inside their respective homes. They cannot even get together for prayer or worship in each other’s houses – doing so has resulted in the arrest and deportation of expatriates in the past. 
 The Maldives was ruled by an authoritarian, conservative Muslim president, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, for 30 years. The nation became a multi-party democracy in 2008 with Mohamed Nasheed – from the largely liberal Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) – as the new president. 
 Gayoom’s right-wing party, the Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party (DRP), however, managed to win a simple majority in the People’s Majlis – as the parliament is known in the Maldives – in the 2009 parliamentary election. The Maldives follows the presidential system. 
 The DRP-led opposition often criticizes Nasheed’s government, accusing it of being liberal in cultural and religious matters, which DRP leaders claim will have a bearing on the country’s sovereignty and identity. 
 A key ally of the MDP, the Adhaalath Party, also holds conservative views on religion and culture. 
 Many in Maldivian society, along with religious and political leaders, believe religious freedom is not healthy for the nation’s survival, although the Maldives does not perceive any threat from nearby countries.
