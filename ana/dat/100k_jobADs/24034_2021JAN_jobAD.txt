 Flipside enables blockchains to live up to their full potential, by decoding and explaining blockchain behaviors. Our proprietary process extracts all of the data from blockchains and applies labels to transactions in order to identify and understand on-chain behaviors. The data is then streamed into our Business Intelligence Dashboards, to provide a clear view of real-time stakeholder behaviors and all asset flows. Flipside provides analytics to more than 80 cryptocurrency organizations and distributes ratings products via partners such as CoinMarketCap, Messari, MarketWatch and TheStreet. Flipside Crypto is backed by True Ventures, Founder Collective, CoinBase Ventures, Digital Currency Group, Galaxy Digital, and other investors.
