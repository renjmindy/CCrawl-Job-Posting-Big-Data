 Reporting to the group finance controller day to day you will work closely with various stakeholders including the P2P GPO, O2C GPO, Project COE and other transactional teams to deliver consistent design, deployment, process improvements and better financial control whilst ensuring cost effectiveness across the record to report processes. 
 More specifically you will be responsible for the global design and adoption establishing a clear vision for global R2R processes; defining processes, policies, procedures and systems and developing the global strategy. Compliance will play a major part of the role ensuring financial accounting data quality standards are properly defined and data integrity maintained. You will also be in charge of achieving operational excellence holding yourself responsible and accountable for continuous improvement. 
 The successful candidate will have a proven track record in an R2R GPO role ideally from a FTSE 250 business.
