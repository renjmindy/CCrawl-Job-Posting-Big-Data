 Commercial Finance Manager - Cambridge - 65 - 75k + Bonus 
 Gleesons are working with one of the fastest-growing tech organisations in the country and have partnered exclusively to build a new finance team. The business has seen rapid expansion with 40% year on year growth and an IPO on the horizon. 
 This is a new role that will see a Qualified Accountant (ACA, ACCA, CIMA) bridge the gap between finance and the commercial teams to ensure all new contracts are financially viable and supporting the ongoing education of the sales teams. The role will require an individual who wants a commercially focused role that will report directly to the Finance Director and will engage with the leadership team on a daily basis. 
 Previous experience in a contract focused environment and knowledge of the evaluation process will be an advantage, but not essential. Although the role is not month-end or technically focused, there will still be a requirement for the Commercial Finance Manager to understand the numbers and how the slightest change in the margin or payment terms can affect revenue. 
 The environment in the business is ever-changing and will suit an individual who is looking to build a plethora of commercially focused key achievements. The role will develop further and provides a unique platform to build a team and have a direct influence within a rapidly growing PE environment. 
 The right person for the role will need to have previous experience in a Finance Business Partnering role, with a keen eye for detail and a hands-on attitude. The business is changing daily and needs someone who is not phased by tight deadlines and sometimes work into the evening due to the organisation's global reach. 
 Commercial Finance Manager Package 
 
 £65,000 - £75,000 
 Bonus 
 Flexi working
