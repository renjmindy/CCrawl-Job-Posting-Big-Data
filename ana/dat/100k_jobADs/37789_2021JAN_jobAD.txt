 Unfortunately, the demand for Home Health Aides and Personal Care Assistants is just beginning to explode. The need will only increase as more baby boomers begin to experience chronic illnesses or disabilities that require assistance around the home. 
 This can range from assisting with basic day-to-day tasks to supporting doctors and nurses in providing ongoing health care.
