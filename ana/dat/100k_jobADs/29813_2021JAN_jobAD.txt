 Full-Time Jobs in New Plymouth 
 The New Plymouth and Taranaki region offers plenty of great opportunities for full-time employment. As a key contributor to the national GDP, dairy farming is one of the region's largest sectors of employment. Full-time jobs in this sector are regularly available for skilled candidates. 
 The area is also home to New Zealand's growing oil and gas programmes, with a high demand for candidates who have previous experience working these sectors. Other thriving industries throughout the region include engineering, healthcare and construction. 
 If you are a foreigner hoping to get a full-time job in New Plymouth, you must have the correct visa to work in New Zealand. If you already have a job offer in one of New Zealand's skill shortage industries, you may be able to apply for a resident visa, which will allow you to live and work in New Plymouth indefinitely. 
 You can check the skilled migrant system to discover your eligibility. This points-based system assesses your eligibility based on your age, health, character, qualifications, previous work experience and other relevant factors. For further details about the New Zealand visa process, check out the Immigration New Zealand website.
