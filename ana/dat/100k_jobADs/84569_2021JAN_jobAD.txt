 My client, a world leader and award winning employer require a Finance and Treasury accountant for 6 months. Not only is this a great opportunity to work for a global business but also the chance to scope and shape the role for future development. 
 This role is based at head office which is situated in an amazing location in West London. Specifically, the position is responsible for the production of financial and management information for statutory and internal reporting requirements. Primary responsibility is the financial accounting for one entity and several subsidiaries. In reality the role is interesting and varied with the opportunity to improve the existing manual processes, work with the treasury team and make suggestions regarding the future content of the job. 
 The successful individual will be a qualified accountant with a demonstrable record of head office reporting and technical accounting. You will also have strong excel skills and some experience of, or a keen interest in, working within treasury. Finally, we require an individual who can build relationships internally, is flexible in their approach and who can manage their time and workload in an appropriate manner for a head office environment. 
 This is a super opportunity to work for a business that is passionate about its people, in amazing surroundings with the chance to make a real impact on the future of the corporate finance team.
