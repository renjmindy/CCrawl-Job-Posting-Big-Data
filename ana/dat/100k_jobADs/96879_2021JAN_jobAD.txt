 Blindly bidding on the job without reading completely will end up in rejection. Our team is looking for an experienced writer who can dedicate 4-5 hours a day when required. At times when the work is slow, lesser number of hours is fine. 1- No grammatical mistakes in the content is expected. 2- Should be able to write on all niches including - Travel, dating, Home improvement etc. If you have any issues writing for dating niche, no need to apply. Its better to let those apply who do their work professionally. Ours is mostly non technical and hence we do not need technical writers. 3- Should be able to take up work from the team responsibly and deliver on time. 4- No teams or freelance companies who outsource the work to others. A big no from my side. Only individual freelancers apply. 5- If you have too much time constraints and are busy with already existing work, please excuse but we need more hours when needed. 6- The prices do vary a bit between 20-30 ppw paid weekly. 7- Since the work volume is high, we need consistency. 8- Non plagiarised content. If you think you match up all these requirements, do send us some of your published urls or writing samples. Also mention your charges in the bid.
