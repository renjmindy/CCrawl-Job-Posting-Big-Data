 How do you respond to the question "When are you going to get a REAL job?" 
 August 18, 2014 by  Erica Martin   Leave a Comment 
 
 If you work at home, at one point or another someone has probably asked you when you're going to get a "real" job. There are a lot of different ways to respond to this question. In this blog post, I'm going to share a few people's responses to this question. 
 Full-time blogger Charles Floate has been working from home since November 2013. In addition to blogging, he also manages SEO and Marketing clients. Whenever his family and friends ask him when he's going to get a real job he says "I'm living my life, and I hate answering to anybody." 
 Small business marketing strategiest Gail Gardner has been working from home for 14 years, ever since she quit her job at IBM. Her favorite response when someone asks her when she's going to get a "real" job is "What part of I will never have another J.O.B. (Just Over Broke) do you not understand"? 
 Internet marketer and blogger Paul Manwaring has been working from home on and off for about 5 years. When he first started working from home, his family and friends used to ask him when he was going to get a real job - he showed them how much he was earning working from home, and how much he was saving not having to commute, and they left him alone. 
 Marketing communication specialist Gilbert Pacheco has been working from home since 2002 - he provides marketing communication services and professional writing and web design services to his clients. Whenever someone asks him when he's going to get a real job, he explains the difference between a W-2 employee and a 1099 contractor. He is a 1099 contractor and loves his job, and that he can manage his time and freedom and has the satisfaction of knowing he's creating employment opportunities for others. 
 In addition, here are a few responses from some of the bloggers I follow regularly: 
 "If it's not a real job, then stop hitting me up for fake money" - Kim Artlip, owner of the Work at Home Mafia website. 
 "If it's not a real job, then please tell the IRS, because I sure paid some real taxes last year" - Leisa Good. 
 Working from home is great, but it can be tough to know how to respond to people when they ask you when you're going to get a real job - I hope this blog post has provided you with some ideas and insight about how to answer this question when and if your're asked.
