  5 Tips For Navigating A Career Transition Successfully  
 Six Sigma Online 
 May 03, 2014 
 A career transition from one type of job to another can be a chosen path or it can be like a Tsunami wave that seems to engulf everything in its path.  Related:   Career Transition For Middle-Aged Professionals  In either case, the way a person navigates a career transition translates into the difference between amazing success and failure. Here are five tips for navigating a career transition as effectively and successfully as possible: 
 
 1. Accept Help When Faced With A Career Transition 
 If you are taking on a career transition on your own ask friends and colleagues in the field for advice, counsel, tips, and introductions. They will be flattered and more times than not they will help you. If you find that one person’s advice and counsel is particularly useful ask them to mentor you on a regular basis. A good mentor can make the transition from one career into another much easier. At the same time they are teaching you, they will be gaining a valuable ally and colleague for future projects and connections. Even though you will be getting more from the relationship initially, every good mentor knows that there will be chances to reciprocate over time. Use transitional services if they are available to you through your previous employer or a government organization. Ex-military, mature workers, immigrants, low income youth and people with disabilities or problematic health issues (especially those that have caused work issues in the past) all have access to government programs and services to help navigate a career transition. In some cases, large corporations will have career transition services available to laid-off employees. Training, resume services, life counseling, and job placement services are often available. 
 2. Set Up A Weekly Schedule To Learn Them 
 Successful career transitions rarely happen without acquiring new skills. Embrace the learning process and look at this time as an investment in your future. Rarely will there be time to acquire these new skills. Make time by temporarily taking some of your “free time” and devoting it to your self-development. This is an extremely important step for women who often spend much of their “free time” taking care of others. Clearly explain to your loved ones that this is a temporary and essential step to improving your collective future. 
 3. Don’t Quit Your Day Job 
 Hating where you work and what you do is an intolerable permanent situation. However, it is a tolerable temporary predicament. Having the additional income coming in while preparing for a new career prevents stress. In addition, acquiring new skills and preparing for a new career often provides hope and optimism. This optimism can migrate into the current hated career and make it tolerable. Knowing that there is an end to horrible employment is fabulous knowledge. 
 4. Plan On The Unexpected 
 A career transition rarely goes to plan. Keeping an open mind about where your new skills can take you helps to increase possibilities and secure an excellent “next career.” For example, taking marketing classes may make it possible to get an excellent job in sales. This may not be the career transition you were expecting, but it might end up being the career you love. 
 5. Be Kind To Yourself And Keep At It 
 Learning new skills and making a career transition is stressful and difficult for most adults. Embracing change is tough. Furthermore, a successful career transition takes time. Often, friends and family won’t be as supportive as they could be. If this is the case, make a point of making new connections with people that are optimistic, upbeat, and supportive of your career transition. Local and online support and entrepreneurial groups are excellent places to find support and encouragement. You will get through this!
