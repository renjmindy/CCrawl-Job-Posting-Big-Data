 Digital Marketing Careers 
 Building a better agency through our team. 
 
 Hi, we’re Workshop Digital. 
 We’re a  digital marketing agency  based in Richmond, VA. We help exceptional businesses grow through results-driven marketing. Everything we do is driven by our purpose of building a better agency. Since day one, we’ve let our values pave the way. 
 Check out our digital marketing jobs—remote options available! 
 As unabashed numbers nerds, we create clarity out of data. But we’re passionate digital marketing advocates driven by real relationships. As a proud digital-first agency, we bring deep  search engine marketing  expertise to the table. We hire smart people looking for a challenge. We’re eager to test new approaches and ready to share our results. 
 Our Culture 
 See what working here means to our team. 
 Lots of companies talk up their culture. We let ours speak for itself. 
 Workshop Perks 
 We go beyond the requisite ping-pong table and office kegerator (though we have those, too!) and create a company culture that fosters development and encourages growth. We provide the opportunity for team members to lead healthier, happier lives. Here are just a few of our perks. 
 Insurance & Retirement Options 
 We offer comprehensive medical, dental, vision, and life insurance packages, as well as 401k and profit sharing options. 
 Growth & Training 
 From training and development courses to personalized growth plans and frequent check-ins, we help our team advance their careers. 
 Community & Volunteer Opportunities 
 We believe in giving back to the Richmond community we love and offer team members paid volunteer time each month. 
 Transparent, Values-Driven Agency 
 We’re driven by our values. Monthly meetings and bi-annual offsites encourage employee feedback and team building. 
 Flexible Paid Time Off 
 Work-life balance actually means something here. Need time off? Counting vacation and sick days is a thing of the past. 
 Encouraging Office Culture 
 Planning committees and company events foster camaraderie, community engagement, and wellness across all teams. 
 Office Life 
 Empowered to be awesome. 
 We're a values-driven agency that provides opportunities for our team to have fun and grow.

 Handcrafted, people-driven marketing. 
 There can be a lot of smoke and mirrors in the digital marketing industry. That's why we challenge each other to do good work. At Workshop Digital, analysts own their own accounts. Unlike other agencies that crank out automated results, we take the time to handcraft strategies.
