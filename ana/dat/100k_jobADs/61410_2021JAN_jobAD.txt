 Hello all 
 Will keep this short but I want to put all my free time over this lockdown period to good use. I am looking to chat with like-minded individuals to bounce ideas off, focusing on identifying and solving real-world problems with a viable, scalable business proposition. Ideally, you have a similar mindset and believe businesses can still be bootstrapped and built successfully without heavy VC funding (at least not right at the start) while still adding both financial and social value. 
 A little bit about myself. I come from an operations and product background but have some experience with digital marketing, sales and website development. I have recently moved on from a SAAS discount platform I founded and find myself with lots of spare time and looking to get my teeth into a new project. I have strong connections to on-shore and offshore development teams but particularly interested in trying to build a physical product. 
 I am not looking for anyone with a particular skill set/experience at this stage, just someone that wants to try and create some ideas, see where it leads us and has some fun along the way. A CV is not required, just a short paragraph about yourself will suffice. Even if you are not the right fit for me I might be able to pair you with other applicants :) 
 Cheers 
 Chris
