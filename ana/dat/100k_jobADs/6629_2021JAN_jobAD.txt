 Job 32 
 1 So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. 
 2 Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God. 
 3 Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job. 
 4 Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he. 
 5 When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled. 
 6 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion. 
 7 I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom. 
 8 But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding. 
 9 Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment. 
 10 Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion. 
 11 Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say. 
 12 Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words: 
 13 Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man. 
 14 Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches. 
 15 They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking. 
 16 When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;) 
 17 I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion. 
 18 For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me. 
 19 Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles. 
 20 I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer. 
 21 Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man. 
 22 For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.

 Job 32:15-17 (MSG) 
15 "Do you three have nothing else to say? 
Of course you don't! You're total frauds! 
16 Why should I wait any longer, 
now that you're stopped dead in your tracks? 
17 I'm ready to speak my piece. That's right! 
It's my turn—and it's about time! 
 Truth spoken with bad attitude poisons it's reception. There is a right way and a wrong way to say the truth. 
 Paul said it like this. 
 Ephesians 4:15 (MSG) 
15 God wants us to grow up, to know the whole truth and tell it in love—like Christ in everything. We take our lead from Christ, who is the source of everything we do. 
 Without love, without care for others we will brandish the sword of God's word a swing this mighty weapon haphazardly without a thought for the consequences of repercussions of our actions. 
 We will stand righteously dignified feeling a sense of accomplishment next to a wounded, and bloody soul. The word can sometimes cut deep. When we speak the truth in love our hands our surgical rather than swift to impale. 
 God grant us the grace to never view being right as an allowance for applying the word with such force and veracity that we leave a bloody trail unbeknownst to us. 
 1 Peter 1:22 (AMPC) 
22 Since by your obedience to the Truth through the [Holy] Spirit you have purified your hearts for the sincere affection of the brethren, [see that you] love one another fervently from a pure heart.

 We cannot allow ourselves to disregard the words of those that are younger. We may be older and wiser in somethings but I cannot say all things. It would be foolish for me to think that someone's age triumphs the power of God that works in and through man. 
 It is important that we pray for discernment and be willing to listen and obey Godly council and wisdom without bias. Jesus was 12 and he Wowed great men, God spoke through a donkey. So what makes us think he can't speak through a child or young person? Oh ye of little faith! All He needs is a willing vessel.

 Just to clarify a little further always compare "the words" of others with "The Word of God" and take it to the man of God. This process will keep us all out of trouble.

 Elihu waited and spoke out of respect. He respect his elders, didn't interrupt, listened, and when they were done speaking he respected God and spoke up! Things are suppose to be done decently and in order and elihu followed through with that even with his dismay at his elders. 
 Elderly people should be teaching and speaking wisdom but even today we see that just because someone is old does not mean they are wise. Wisdom is the application of knowledge, don't expect Godly wisdom to flow from the mouths of people who do not know Him! Seek wisdom from those who seek God. Understanding comes from God. 
 Proverbs 4:7 
 Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: 
and with all thy getting get understanding. 
 If God is the giver of understanding and wisdom then to obtain it we must seek out God personally. Don't just rely on others wisdom, theirs may falter at times.

 This is what Elihu, son of Barakel the Buzite, said: “I’m a young man, and you are all old and experienced. That’s why I kept quiet and held back from joining the discussion. I kept thinking, ‘Experience will tell. The longer you live, the wiser you become.’ But I see I was wrong—it’s God’s Spirit in a person, the breath of the Almighty One, that makes wise human insight possible. The experts have no corner on wisdom; getting old doesn’t guarantee good sense. So I’ve decided to speak up. Listen well! I’m going to tell you exactly what I think. (‭Job‬ ‭32‬:‭6-10‬ MSG) 
 This so true! Many times The LORD has spoken through my son Jose, and also My daughter Gabriela. It wasn't my husband or my mother but through my own children.

 No answer because they know its the truth there are angry with Job because they know. He speak the truth. You also see in this chapter they are judge job telling him he sin and that's why he like this and he needs to confession sin but they don't know the back story they don't know that job was being test they don't know that GOD is working in him

 THE WISE GOD 
 Job‬ ‭32:8‬ But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.‭‭ ‭KJV‬‬ 
 We learn from this chapter and particularly this verse that men can get old without becoming wise, but men can become wise without getting old. 
 A WISE MAN will always seek FIRST the LORD. When the LORD JESUS does not speak to us then we should also refrain from speaking to others. When we do not hear the LORS speak to us, we should only speak concerning matters that we know and have experienced in GOD. 
 Seeking FIRST the Kingdom of GOD prepares us for future opportunities. Seeking GOD FIRST allows HIS Spirit, the Spirit of Wisdom to influence our thinking and ultimately our words and choices. 
 Choose JESUS and follow Wisdom in JESUS name.

 AMP - 3 Elihu’s anger burned against Job’s three friends because they had found no answer [and were unable to determine Job’s error], and yet they had condemned Job and declared him to be in the wrong [and responsible for his own afflictions]. 
 Somethings just can't be explained, because only knows what trials we are going to face and what character He is building in us through those trials. Job's friends tried to find the "fault" or "reason" he was in the shape he was in. 
 The devil had to ask permission to try Job in this manner and God granted him permission to try anything but taking his life to get him to speak against God. God had confidence that Job would withstand the trial. 
 Any test/trial that comes to our lives, we must trust the Lord that He has given permission for that trial and not to try to find whose fault it is that we are going through it. Just find the purpose of the test and get through it, while praising the Lord in sincerity. The more we grumble and complain about it, the longer the trial will be.

 1Job’s three friends refused to reply further to him because he kept insisting on his innocence. 
2Then Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the clan of Ram, became angry. He was angry because Job refused to admit that he had sinned and that God was right in punishing 
 This young man Elihu waited for his turn to talk. He was amazed that Job would not accept his guilt. He was amazed that the other Elders could not convince him of his wrong. The thing about it is, God will give the righteous wisdom that no one can resist.

 I believed the same as Elihu most of my life. I was young and dumb; what did I have to contribute to any conversation. At times, I believed I may have had something worth saying but refrained from speaking up in fear of appearing foolish and off topic. However, I have learned as Elihu, age and experience has nothing to do with divine wisdom. Don’t get me wrong, age and experience equips those who have survived, with an insight that only endurance can provide. 
 This does not grant “all” knowledge, understanding and wisdom to anyone; old, young, naive or experienced. I believe we are referred to as a body of Christ because it takes an entire body to fully live be useful to the Kingdom of God. It takes a some of and from everybody.

 (16)Should I continue to wait, now that you are silent? Must I also remain silent? (17) No, I will say my pice. I will Speak my mind. Job 32. 16,17 
 As a Young Generation which I'm apart of, one thing I noticed is that are emotions get ahead of us and when we realized sometimes it's too late to take things back. As I grow in the Lord I pray that I'll be able to speak wisely. For the sake of his kingdom and the glorification of his name (jesus) through me.

Its like your heart inside your stomach and the only way to get it right is to SPEAK whats right. Say what you need to say, preach what needs to be preached. Elihu said he didnt care if he offended anyone hes gonna say what needs to be said because the spirit of the Lord is rushing through his body and thats what gave him his understanding. Though he may be young but he shows that age is just a number when it comes to wisdom bwing fullfilled with the spirit of God

 Job 32:6 So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said: “I am young in years, and you are old; that is why I was fearful, not daring to tell you what I know. 
 There is something that is taught in the Hispanic culture, never interrupt an adult when he is speaking. The young kid that did not learn this, got the back of a hand to the face. 
 It's the same concept that Elihu was taught as a young child. Even now if I am in a group of older men, unless I'm asked my opinion, I just keep my mouth shut. 
 This generation has lost its mind in there utter disregard to there elders. Elders are not regarded thale same way they were. They are looked upon like outdated, antiquated, uneducated people that can not contribute. The proverbs were writtten nearly 1000 years before Christ, and yet we can still read them and find wisdom. 
 Enough said!

 Elihu was a young that had respect for elders. He waited to state his opinion until after his elders were done. This reminds us that no matter how long we been in the church. We can still have room to learn. We haven't got to wise to know everything.

 Flatter-lavish insincere praise and compliments upon (someone), especially to further one's own interests. 
 The only one we should be praising is God!!! Yes there are many great woman and men of God which I am thankful for but because of God they have survived their trials and pains. We must praise the name above all names and not seek title, but work and work, and work, and pray, and fast, and read the Word, and GO make disciples!!! We must submit the carnal because if we don't its going to be very dangerous and we are going to be so consumed with wickedness if we don't submit and obey the Lord!!!

 In this scripture you really find out who your friends are or shall I say aren't and how these friends think they have wisdom. It's not by position, popularity, age nor is obtain through your genetics. It's truly given by God, only he can define it in your life. It's through his Word, and by his Spirit we gain Wisdom! 
 Finally the realization of the reasoning of Job's conditions existed through the hand of God. 
 13 Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.

 For most, it's the hardest thing to do is to admit he is wrong. No one likes to hear they made a mistake, and then be called out for it. It takes someone who is humble to admit his wrong doing. But this is what we have to do if we want God to forgive us.

 Don't be an ear tickler. Don't speak flattering words. They will get you know where. There just like a bag of potato chips. Looks good. Tastes good. But what nutrional value do they have? They don't. Flattering words are the same. Look good sound good taste good. But add no value to anything. This is why we must speak with a purpose and with excellence.

 Elihu has been waiting listening from the sidelines of the heated debate between Job and his friends. Apparently he's been bursting to put I his two cents in but has been holding back because of cultural values. Not only was it considered disrespectful to speak before the elders but a young persons "wisdom" was often considered deficent. Elihu doesn't see it that way in fact he, like the others believe that he speaks with divine inspiration. Elihus does make some valuable points that Jobs other friends missed, especially the possibility of a gracious God using suffering to chasten and restore rather than to punish him. However, his uniformed conclusions reveal that his wisdom was mostly only in his own eyes. We can speak encouraging words to our elders also as young people, but as long as it lines up with the Word and our man of God. 
 Timothy encourages the young to minister and how to do it in order. 1Tim4: 12Don’t let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity. 13Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to preaching and to teaching. 14Do not neglect your gift, which was given you through prophecy when the body of elders laid their hands on you.

 If we are sure that the Spirit of God suggested what we are about to say still we ought to refrain, till it comes to our turn to speak. God is a God of order not of confusion. It is great refreshment to a good man to speak for the glory of the Lord and to edify others.

(Job 32:9 KJV) 
 Perception and discernment is important to consider here as Elihu, a younger man, explains how he sees Jobs situation differently. He was respectful enough to wait to say his peace, he even pointed out that Jobs trails may be not to punish but to restore him. The truth he shares is valuable even though he could have come to Job with a more humble heart willing to encourage an elder not scold him.

 Job 32:13 Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusters him down, not man. 
 Jeremiah 9:23 Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: 
 Glory in knowing the Lord! 
 I Cor 1:29 That no flesh should glory in his presence.

 Respect your elders 
 4 Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he. 
 What happened to this? We hear the young argue with their elders all the time now. If we would just listen first, no telling what you could learn.

 This is a great lesson for the youth of today to get a hold off. We must always respect our elders. Yes Elihu spoke but there is a time and season for everything. Even at his young age he showed wisdom by waiting paying respect.

 Judgment is more than a word to Job. He was condemned by his so called friends. God used a young man Elihu to speak truth and fairness unto Job's friends. Why is it that people like to rejoice over other peoples down falls when they themselves are sinners and portray to be so perfect. 
 Elihu said Job wasn't treated fairly that's why he was in total disagreement with Job's friends. Appears to me that fairness is of upmost importance to God. God knows exactly what Job is going through, he knows Job will pass this test. 
 Can we pass the tests that God puts us through so we can grow and learn from them or are we giving the enemy the pleasure of our downfalls. The Lord strengthened, lifted and trusted Job as he went through tests and trials. 
 Father your in control lead me and order my steps to where you want me to go and deliver me all evil.

 It is wise to show deference to seniority in a situation, whether it be on account of age or experience or any other pertinent quality, depending on the situation. Another way to put it is to give honor to the one(s) in authority for whatever matter is at hand. God Himself confronts this very subject towards the end of the book of Job, wording it this way within the context of Job's situation: 
 Job 38:1-4 AMP 
1 Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind and said, 
 2 “Who is this that darkens counsel [questioning my authority and wisdom] By words without knowledge? 
 3 “Now gird up your loins like a man, And I will ask you, and you instruct Me! 
 4 “Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell Me, if you know and have understanding. 
 God went on to give many other examples in which He established His authority on the matters debated by Job and His friends, declaring that His authority was not based on Him simply "being God" but was based upon His experiences which allowed Him to stand as witness to all truth with all understanding. God asked (among other questions,) "Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?" If we are not a part of a situation and intimately aware of all the circumstances and developments associated with it, God Himself established that we are to humble ourselves and defer to those who are or were in that position, which includes God who stands as witness with each individual to affirm the reality of their experience. It is about much more than exercising good social graces, it is about submitting to God's order for individuals to be able to speak with authority when giving witness of their personal experiences. 
 Proverbs 18:2, 13 AMP 
2 A [closed-minded] fool does not delight in understanding, But only in revealing his personal opinions [unwittingly displaying his self-indulgence and his stupidity]. 
 13 He who answers before he hears [the facts]— It is folly and shame to him. 
 Proverbs 10:19, 32 AMP 
19 When there are many words, transgression and offense are unavoidable, But he who controls his lips and keeps thoughtful silence is wise. 
 32 The lips of the righteous know (speak) what is acceptable, But the mouth of the wicked knows (speaks) what is perverted (twisted).

 v21-22 Let me not, I pray, show partiality to anyone; 
Nor let me flatterer any man. 
For I do not know how to flatterer, 
Else my Maker would soon take me away.

 Everyone has an opinion whether right or wrong. We must take it to God's word and find truth. If ever in question, pray and the Lord will direct you and as it has happened to me time and time again the Lord has confirmed my questions through my Pastor, my parents and other elders in my life.

 20 I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer. 
 To be refreshed in the word of the LORD. I have been about myself these past few days and have been convicted about not blogging. It has been a humbling experience for myself; for GOD has shown me that HIS word is wisdom and that I need to be in it everyday. 
 In the Hebrew: napas a primitive root; to breathe; passive, to be breathed upon. 
 1Co 16:18 For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such. 
 I really never thought about how valuable the word of GOD is until now. HIS word is even more precious than gold or riches of any kind……Thank you Jesus!!!!

 “And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.” 
‭‭Job‬ ‭32:6‬ ‭KJV‬‬ 
 Oh little nuggets of God 
Even when people were ridiculous, they still respected their elders. They waited their turn to speak and reverence the elderly'S opinions sounds like respect and reverance for the elderly were some key principles back then.
