 Most of our partner job boards require a specific location to be set for each job before they will allow it to go live, and they generally do not allow multiple locations to be listed in one posting. 
 In order to post your job to multiple locations, you need to create a separate job for each location. To make this easier, you can simply ** clone  **the original job so that the job description and application form will stay the same. The only thing you need to edit is the location. 
 Once you clone the job and update the location of the position in the job editor you will then be able to publish the job.
