 My diary is full for next one year 
 Dec 13 
 Posted by  NaranTeam 
 Naran 
 Sita a singer – naturally talented, came to see me two years back. She was finding it difficult to get good opportunities. 
 One day, while browsing through my blogs, she picked the switch word combination to get a job, “FIND DIVINE ORDER COUNT NOW DONE” as her job mantra. She bought herself a diary. She started writing that combination whenever she found time until the diary was full. 
 Her whole career took a positive turn. She started getting a lot of singing opportunities. 
 What about off-season, where even professionally recognized singers don’t get opportunity? She uses that free time to write the switch word combination in her (new) diary. Interestingly, as soon as she finishes few pages of writing, she gets some opportunity or other.

 As guided by you in the past few weeks, I am calm and peaceful by myself. Now that the marriage is round the corner (of my niece - husband’s brother’s daughter), I need to attend. 
 All the past incidents of harassment, sarcastic remarks, aloofness etc. of my husband’s Anni is coming to my mind and I need enough strength to face it all this time. I want to raise above all this silly behavior of others and come out successfully, to neutralize my karma. 
 Naran 
 Chant “CHOCOLATE CONCEDE TOGETHER DIVINE”. 
 Chant “I am sorry. Please forgive me”, as many times as possible. Your anger and resentment - whether it is right or not - will upset your stomach, which in turn increases your insecurity. 
 Take the flower remedies AGRIMONY, WILLOW and CHERRY PLUM. 
 Leela 
 Since yesterday, I am practicing as advised by you. I do not understand, why, often I get this thought flashed in my mind. That I need to move away from my husband? I do not know if it is a natural process. It is a soul-searching experience for me. I need your divine help and guidance. 
 Naran 
 Soul searching is to happen within. It does not depend on outside person or event. 
 Leela 
 I attended the marriage and chanted the Switch Words as advised by you. I am back to Bangalore. I am trying to find the golden nugget … May be my spiritual awareness is not enough to find one. 
 As I have disclosed to you before, I have this urgent need to go back to work in UK. I have contacted my ex-colleagues, friends, and contacts and passed on my resume. 
 Initially, they were very encouraging, told me to help me out with a job. But as days went by, there is no communication from them regarding my application status. Also I have applied many jobs. It is Apply, Apply, but no reply. 
 I am chanting “TOGETHER DIVINE FIND JOB COUNT NOW ORDER DONE” and also recently after reading one of your blogs regarding chakra cleansing, I have chanting Bija Mantras (OM LUM…) 
 In between, I am chanting forgive exercise to my husband too. Please advise, what can be chanted. 
 Naran 
 Move away with love in the heart and not in resentment 
 For job: chant “CRYSTAL GORSE WOLF REACH HELP JOB COUNT NOW DONE” 
 Leela 
 I am writing this mail, rather after a long time. I am following the chants and forgive exercise as advised by you. 
 There are lots of changes in me. I am able to forgive many things now. Though, I still remember the events, which had caused me so much anger, hurt and other negative emotions.  After forgive exercise, these emotions have drastically reduced to an intensity of zero! 
 I am now able to appreciate the switch word “CHOCOLATE” as suggested by you. The golden nugget in my case is to get re introduced to healing techniques through you. 
 Thank you very much for your Grace and support you have extended to me - The top most emotional layer of healing has taken place. As a result, my relationship with my husband has improved. 
 As regards to finding a job, this is the next layer to be dealt with. I am chanting and many times writing the Switch words. CRYSTAL has strengthened my intention of job seeking. 
 I am now more confident and beginning to understand what I want. My previous emotional state of confusion together with mixed feelings is no more. I am more calm and focused. 
 Our friend - WOLF is bringing me some leads for job searching and I am working on it.

 Miracle at God’s Place 
 Dec 2 
 Posted by  NaranTeam 
 Kishor 
 I guess this chant “BRING PRAISE DIVINE”, has worked a miracle for me, too. I saw this post “Bring miracle into your life” yesterday and just chanted the mantra for a few times. 
 And by the evening, I have received three good news. It’s just awesome. 
 R Mohan 
 My typical festival holiday would be to sleep well, eat as much as I can, read well and meet a couple of friends. This has been my version of festival holidays. So, I decided to do the same for this year Deepavali, 2013 too. 
 Couple of miracles 
 Last few days, I was chanting, “BRING PRAISE DIVINE”. 
 In the last four years, I had received no call from any corporate company. Today, on a festival day, I received a couple of job offers from one of the well-known company based out of India. Along with that I found opportunities to place people for several positions in the same company. 
 In addition, during the last two days, I have already placed two persons – one a fresher and another one a senior person. Getting jobs for both the types of positions is very difficult in today’s job situation. 
 My first conclusion is that it’s good mantra for those who are desperately trying for a job, but finding it difficult to get it. 
 An act at God’s place 
 I don’t remember when I had gone out with people on a holiday and had a good time too. 
 First time, I went to Temple, a well-known temple in Chennai. They have a 100-year old tradition of celebrating Deepavali. The kind of celebration I haven’t witnessed for a long-time. I thoroughly enjoyed it. 
 Today has been an ideal day for me – professionally and socially, a kind of balance I expect from my life. So I think this miracle mantra would give me the same in the future. 
 Thank you Naran! Thank you Miracle Switch words!!! 
 Naran 
 Miracle is not what you want; it is what God wills. That event is amazing, wonderful and exciting from all perspectives.

 Discovered "The Secret to Perfect Living" 
 Nov 20 
 Posted by  NaranTeam 
 Gene 
 This is a testimony for the switch words, "TOGETHER CHANGE”. It healed my blocked Sinuses and the Pain in my neck. 
 Thank you so much for your blog. I discovered "The Secret to Perfect Living" late last year. I wanted to do more research and found your blog. 
 Every morning after I write my "grateful" words, I visit your blog to learn more about switch words. I also learn about the great powers of Bach flowers and Mudra. 
 I do Prana Mudra all the time. Today was dong Prana Mudra while driving. I am currently in process of securing my finances. I quit my job in April of this year and stepped out in confidence to develop my own income base from my home. I used many of the solutions you suggest for other people. 
 I have chanted “CONCEDE CLEAR FIND COUNT DIVINE NOW ON” for a long time and I have seen some results. I also purchased the ABUNDANCE CD and listen to that almost every morning. I have so much to say but I will have to post it over time. 
 My sinuses were all blocked up 
 My main reason for commenting tonight is this. Last week, the weather changed too cool in the evenings here in California. I have to sleep with the widow open. If I don't, I will get a headache when I wake, because I need air circulating. 
 I woke up very early that morning. My sinuses were all blocked up. I get this way when the cool air comes in at night. 
 I lay there for a moment, and asked myself. "What is the switch word for healing? I remembered that it's CHANGE. So I chanted mentally “CHANGE”. 
 Then I remembered that if I add the master switch word “TOGETHER” that would help. So I chanted mentally, “TOGETHER CHANGE”. After about the 7th or 8th chant, I could actually feel my Sinuses opening up. 
 I kept chanting a few more times in my head and I was actually breathing so clearly. I was amazed how fast I fell asleep with the window still open. 
 When I woke up, I was still breathing very clear TOGETHER CHANGE healed my clogged sinuses. I am so thankful. 
 But it didn't stop there 
 I usually get up early, while I was up and about, I suddenly took notice that I didn't have a neck pain that I have had for the longest time. As a matter of fact, the pain was starting to give me a tension headache. 
 The pain is 99 percent gone. I am amazed a second time. SWITCH WORDS WORK!! These are magic word and more I use them the greater my belief. Thank you so much for your Blog Mr. Naran!!! 
 Today I have been chanting - BRING PRAISE DIVINE. I am in need of a financial miracle. I am sure it is already working.

 Light at the end of dark tunnel 
 Nov 18 
 Posted by  NaranTeam 
 Savi 
 My husband’s bosses have just stopped his salary and don’t talk with him. You asked us to chant the following, “RELEASE RESISTANCE CRYSTAL GORSE WOLF REACH END COUNT DIVINE” and “SRINIVASA ARAVINDALOCHANA”. 
 I keep chanting them in addition to the above, angel numbers 58 and 520 also. 
 One of the bosses (National Sales Mgr.) now talks to my husband about orders, collections etc. However, when they were enquired about my husband’ salary, they say they will look into it, yet no results. 
 Naran 
 Continue the same. What mistakes your husband has committed? 
 Savi 
 Yesterday, they have sent a pay slip with no salary, stating that he has not worked for the month. My husband called up regarding above and NSM only says he will look into it. 
 They say the MD is unhappy. However, no reason is being told verbally or on email. He has achieved the target not only for this year, but within the 9 months he has brought in excess orders to the company, which is 161% of his target. 
 We fail to understand the same. We are unable to run our family. What to do? God and you alone can help us now. 
 Naran 
 Chant “MUSTARD WOLF TOGETHER ADD COUNT DIVINE NOW” 
 Savi 
 Million and millions of thanks! 
 We have seen light at the end of dark tunnel. My husband has received his salary after being put on hold for 60 days. 
 We touch your feet and express our thanks for guiding us to come out of this difficulty. We believe that your help is god sent.
