 Delaware North at Yellowstone Presents Online Jobinar 
 729 people registered to attend an online Job Fair being held by Workamper News with Yellowstone Employer, Delaware North. The webinar is one of several avenues Workamper News provides its members with for finding Great Jobs in Great Places, the company’s moto since 1989. 
 “Today was another example of how Workamper News is bridging the gap between Employers and Workamping Employees” says Sharee Collier, Director of Operations for Workamper News. “Jobinars, are our unique way of providing detailed information directly to our membership base of 50K from the actual employers, first hand.” 
 Delaware North provided a 1-hour presentation on a variety of opportunities they have available inside Yellowstone General Stores and three hotels in West Yellowstone, Montana. 
 What is Delaware North? 
 Delaware North operates 300 stores in parks, resorts, attractions, airports, toll plazas, sporting venues, open-air marketplaces and gaming properties worldwide.
