 Out of Comfort Zone Learning 
 July 18, 2018   Krista 
 Yesterday I attended a learning circle centered on conservation and farmland leasing with female landowners. I found out late last week I would be filling in for one of the University faculty members I work with as the facilitator for part of the discussion.

 Papa's Pig Barn 
 January 17, 2018   Krista 
 The girls’ excitement for “Papa’s Pig Barn” has been building for more than six months! Yes, that's a really long time for little girls to wait!

 September 26, 2017   Krista

Forestry, a category under the Natural Resources career pathway, is a unit where I listen to students try to convince me they don't use trees and trees don't effect them. Aside from trees helping to purify our…  Continue reading What's a Forestry Contest?
