 Our Housing Always Program is committed to promoting and supporting participants with experiences of homelessness, mental illness and addictions to live independently in the community. Participants are offered permanent independent living in individual apartment units with supports that match their presenting needs. This program aims to achieve recovery and housing stability through the provision of supports onsite, and in the community. Initially, the Housing Stability Workers will be primarily supporting participants on site, but caseloads are expected to eventually expand to include participants living in the larger community as well. 
Job Summary: 
The Housing Stability Worker (HSW) will perform duties and responsibilities consistent with providing a psychosocial environment to assist with the rehabilitation and community integration of participants.
