 Dennis, 
 Only the employer can decide if you are qualified or not. But I suggest that you also take the TESDA caregiver examintion to bolster your credentials.

 I am applying for the position of a Care Assistant. 
 The position seems to fit very well with my education, experience, and career interests. 
 The position requires excellent communication and team working skills. I understand the position also requires a candidate who is reliable, resourceful and detail-oriented, works well under pressure, and is able to deal with and complete specific and customized orders. I developed these skills through my work experience and my particular interest in this sphere. 
 My goals and objectives seem to match your requirements well. I am confident that I can perform the job effectively and responsibly, and I am excited about the idea of working for your company. 
 I worked in World Citi Medical Center in Philippines as a Nursing Aide for more than 2 years and 2 more years in Singapore as Healthcare Attendant at Pacific Healthcare Nursing-home. 
 You may contact me at my mobile (+639062541590) or e-mail address (marife_equila@yahoo.com), if you need further details regarding my application. I will be available at your convenience. 
 Thank you for your consideration.
