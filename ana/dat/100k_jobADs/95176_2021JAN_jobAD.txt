 Here are some of the top trends in recruiting that promise to change the way organizations identify, engage, and ultimately hire top talent in the coming years and how employers can adapt procedures to these changes to ensure a successful recruiting program. 
 There are three major trends in how companies connect with top talent in today’s challenging recruiting landscape. These include: 
 1. Increasing role of the employer brand 
 Two-thirds of HR leaders surveyed say their organization is more focused on employer branding than they were 5 years ago. Additionally, more than half (57%) attribute their company’s ability to attract top talent to a strong brand. Not only does an enhanced employer brand help draw in qualified candidates, but it can also lead to improved corporate awareness and reputation. 
 Moreover, the top three reasons why organizations succeed in attracting top talent were found to be a pronounced reputation and brand, strong industry appeal, and competitive salary and benefits. These factors further drive the need for companies to continually enhance their brand to stand out as an employer of choice. 
 2. Culture and aptitude fit win over skills 
 Company culture has an enormous impact on attracting and retaining top talent, which explains why many of the companies noted for their unique, enjoyable work cultures are also some of the most profitable. Investing in the creation and continuous improvement of a differentiated company culture should be a priority for C-suite executives. At the same time, aptitude, personality, and cultural fit will emerge as key factors in the talent selection process, favored over traditional hiring factors, such as specific qualifications. 
 Focusing on aptitude and attitude to do the job, and investing in learning and development to build needed skills and qualifications, will enable organizations to expand their talent pool and enhance their culture. 
 3. The rise of online talent communities 
 More employers will build robust talent communities throughout 2015 to engage with a larger talent pool. This will provide access to passive and active candidates, past applicants, current and former employees, and other members who help employers find the talent they’re looking for. 
 Overall, the company found that 50% of employers plan to invest in social media and online community management in 2015 to better tap this source of talent.

 Your technique may vary, but you should have a basic process to follow when getting ready to call your candidate. First, prepare what you need to make the call. Next, rehearse what you have prepared so your words sound natural when you say them. Now you are ready to make the call. Regardless of what happens when you call, don’t forget the crucial step that many ignore—following up. 
 A Matter of Perspective 
 When you pore over résumé after résumé , especially if you work for a recruiting company, the candidates can seem like just a bunch of files or a set of numbers. But remember, on the other end are living, breathing people who have no idea you exist. Furthermore, if they are searching for jobs, it’s possible that more than a few less-reputable companies have tried to take advantage of them already. They could be on guard. They could be suspicious. Or they could be a delight. The point is, you won’t know until you call—and putting the wrong foot forward could cost you a perfectly good employee. Perspective counts, and taking a moment to remember that really helps. 
 Prepare and Prevail! 
 Again and again, experts underline the absolute need for preparation before you make a call. Calling without preparation makes you sound unsure and might cause a potential candidate to leave the recruitment process before you have a chance to assess his or her potential or attract him or her to your organization. 
 Here are some good ways to make sure you’ll be ready for whatever happens when you call your candidate. A little bit of homework can make all the difference. 
 
 Know what you are going to ask.  Even spending a short time jotting down some general questions you want to ask is better than no preparation at all. If you have the time, a complete list of questions works best. 
 Keep it concise.  Summarize who you are and what you want with a few sentences and have it on hand. This way, if someone other than the candidate picks up, or, more likely, the call goes to voicemail, you’ll have a quick, to-the-point response ready to go. 
 What do you already know?  Construct a fairly detailed list of everything you already know about the candidate. This serves two purposes: first, you can tailor your conversation around those points; second, simply confirming these points with the candidate is a decent good way to organize an interview. 
 
 Rehearse First 
 You’ve done your preparation. So you’re ready to pick up the phone right away, right? Well, if you want to sound natural (and unlike a telemarketer), you might want to take a few moments to read what you wrote down. A few quick things to consider at this point. 
 
 
 Make absolutely certain you can pronounce the candidate’s name.  It’s amazing how well a call can go when the candidate’s name smoothly rolls off your tongue. It’s equally amazing how defensive candidates can become if you botch their name. 
 
 
 Be ready to go off-topic.  While you may have an agenda for the conversation, sometimes you can learn a lot about a candidate based on how they direct the conversation. Don’t become annoyed if they wander; instead, take notes. However, try to stick to business and the job at hand, as casual conversation can lead to finding out things you don’t want to know, for example, race, religion, or disability.

 5 Ways To Get Noticed By Recruiters

 1. Show   No Fear 
 “The best way to stand out to recruiters is to stand up to them” says Joseph Terach, CEO at career services firm. “Don't let them overly influence your preferences for work responsibilities, arrangements or salary based on their reported understanding of the employer." 
 Your job search is your own, even if they are helping. Terach recommends listening to the insider information recruiters can provide, “but keep in mind that recruiters have split allegiances and are salespeople at the end of the day.” 
 2. Communicate 
 Knowing what you want is a great way to stand out, Terach says. You’re not just looking for “a job”; you can tell the recruiter the job you want. 
 “If you come to the table with a crisp professional pitch, not only will your recruiter know exactly what it is you want (and don't want), but they will also be more able to discuss you and communicate your background to potential employers,” he says. “It will save you time because you won't be getting calls for interviews that don't interest you; and when your recruiter finds the right job for you (one that fits your pitch), he/she will have zero reservations to get behind your candidacy 100 percent.” 
 3. Be Honest 
 You of course want to put your best foot forward when dealing with recruiters, but it’s important to be candid about any shortcomings you have as well, says Heather Neisen, talent coordinator. “Self-awareness and honesty are extremely important. Be proud to share your strengths and passions, but also be able to openly discuss areas where you need — or better yet, want — to improve.” 
 Many candidates don’t realize being honest about their shortcomings actually offers a chance to shine, she says. “Admit them and offer ways you’re trying to overcome them. Few things are worse than a candidate who believes they have nothing left to learn.” 
 4. Highlight Your Tenure 
 If you’ve got staying power, promote it, says Andy Barberio, account executive at Fortus Healthcare Resources. “I always look at tenure — tenure is really big. When you find somebody that’s been with an organization for a long time or has helped build it up, they are marketable. Switching jobs every year or year and a half over a five to six year period doesn’t present the best on a resume.” 
 5. Let Yourself Shine 
 Barberio says you can’t teach personality, but if you have it, flaunt it. “Personality and fit and being able to relate to staff is tough,” but it’s what recruiters are looking for. Some positions just require “a special kind of person,” he explains, and recruiters will try to get a feel for who you are when they are meeting with you. Being yourself will help the recruiter find the best fit for you and your skills.

 6 Common Mistakes in Hiring Support Staff

 Support staff are not interchangeable parts. Sidestep these 6 mistakes and you can hire and keep the best. 
 In the army, it’s the infantry; in the factory, the line workers; and in the office, the administrative staff. Every organization has its “troops”—the people who carry out the basic tasks of the business. 
 Think of these folks as interchangeable parts, however, and you could be making a big mistake, says the website, AllBusiness.com. 
 The site published a list of things to keep in mind and do in hiring support staff. The basic message: Put the same kind of care into hiring your “troops” as you would anyone else. Because any chain of command, whether it’s in the heat of battle or the heat of business competition, is only as strong as its weakest link. 
 We’ve paraphrased and condensed some of their advice. 
 Don’t rush. 
 Because support staff is often urgently needed and relatively cheap in payroll impact, it may be tempting to simply go out and hire the first candidates in the door. Not a good idea. Instead, make a list of the specific skills and characteristics you’re looking for, whether it’s proficiency in certain office systems or a cool attitude to fit in a pressure situation. Then make sure your job ad clearly projects your needs. 
 Screen, as you would for any job. 
 Who needs to spend time comparing resumés and calling references for a file clerk? You do! These screening steps are as essential for support jobs as for any other and will help you whittle down the field to the best candidates, without going through a lot of unproductive interviews. 
 Bring others in. 
 Support staff usually interact with a lot of people, so it’s wise to call on others and get their needs and preferences before hiring and to invite them to meet or even interview your top candidates. And don’t hesitate to test skills. If the skills are technical in nature, such as computer operations, have the testing done by the relevant manager. 
 **Don’t overhire! ** 
 When things are piling up and everyone’s screaming for help, it may seem wise to hire as many support personnel as you can. Remember, though, that crunch time is the exception, not the rule. You can always bring in additional support staff (perhaps through temps). It’s a lot harder to let people go, or worse, to spend your time coming up with things for them to work on when things get slower. 
 **Retention counts for support staff, too. ** 
 While you’re dreaming up uber-benefits to keep your CEO or CFO, don’t forget the folks who turn their grand plans into reality. Assemble the best benefits package you can for your top support staff, then use those perks as a recruitment and retention lure. 
 Don’t be stampeded by cries for help by your internal clients. 
 Sending them a bad hire is worse than sending them no hire. Work diligently to find the right candidates and those cries will soon turn to cheers.

 What Are Your Applicants Looking For From You?

 Recruiting today has gotten complex. People want to apply online or use their phones. And services abound to help you with the process. A good place to start is to ask what applicants are looking for and what they are seeing when the check out your company. 
 What You Say About Yourself 
 First, check out what you are saying about yourself. General company website. Does it make the company attractive? Would a candidate say, I’d be proud to work there? Recruiting website. Does it give an attractive picture of what it is like to work at your company? (This is often done by video tours and videos of workers.) Is it easy to navigate? Easy to apply? Social media. Is your organization active on social media? 
 **What Others Say About You ** 
 Look at social media again—what is being said about your organization? And check out websites that collect comments from workers and former workers. Sometimes these sites are “trash” sites. Still, it is interesting to know what is being said. If candidates are going to be reading these comments, you want to be ready to offer your version of the story. 
 For example, maybe the comments say that your workplace is an “evil sweatshop.” You might be ready to say, “It’s true that we work hard here; we have a highly motivated team of achievers that is working on exciting, cutting-edge development. But we also play hard, and we reward our workers very well and you set your own hours and take time off whenever you want. If you’re looking for a workplace where the work is repetitive, slow, and deliberate, we’re probably not the place for you.” 
 **What Are Candidates Looking For? ** 
 First of all, recognize that they will look. Surveys suggest that many jobseekers are researching potential employers by visiting their websites. So, as mentioned, make sure your site is well-designed and friendly. 
 You know your audience, I hope, and what they are looking for in a company and in a job, and you know what you offer. Find a way to marry those two things. 
 And then there’s the issue of applying online. Today’s applicant wants it to be easy, and reports suggest that many will give up if the site is too confusing or doesn’t work the way they want it to. 
 Visit your site. Try to apply. Try it from your home computer, your tablet, and your phone. The exercise could be revealing. 
 Apply-by-Phone 
 Apply-by-phone is in the news these days, with some calling it a “must-have” feature. One advantage is that many people who don’t have easy access to a computer do have access to the Internet on their phones. But most phone applications systems are clumsy and difficult. Further, it’s often hard to upload a résumé from a phone. This is an issue you will have to face if you think you’re losing good applicants over it. 
 There are many recruiting avenues for you to use and most experts recommend trying several—you’ll soon see which ones work for you. And, as an aside, from a legal standpoint, you want to use several avenues to avoid charges of discrimination. 
 But there are still certain basics that need to be in place no matter what system you use to attract and evaluate candidates.

 The Only Resume Advice You’ll Ever Need

 by Trudy Steinfeld | Forbes 
 If you have ever been looking for a job I’m sure asked yourself: “What can I do to make my resume stand out and get an employer to seriously consider me for a job”? If you Googled the term “resume”, you know that there’s a dizzying array of information and advice out there about what works best in putting something together that presents you best. How do you make sense of it all? I’m going to make it easy for you – I have looked at well over 50,000 resumes and talk daily with Recruiters and HR Directors who are often the ones making the first pass at your resume. 
 No matter your experience level or what kind of job you’re looking for, these are the most important “insider tips” you will need to know and do: 
 
 The “one-size fits all” approach won’t cut it in a marketplace of increasingly specialized needs.  So plan on having several versions of your resume adjusted for the different jobs you are applying for. Include ways you can make an immediate contribution to the organization that reflects the homework you should be doing about the organization you’re applying to. Make sure that you – and at least one other person you trust – carefully review your resume and adjust it to contain the “key words” that recruiters will be searching for. 
 Don’t worry about an objective  – employers will skip over this, or worse, will screen your resume out based on an objective that is not a perfect match for the job they are hiring for. Instead let your experience, skills and results-driven descriptions make the case for you. 
 “Space equals importance”,  so put the most critical information first and spend more time and space talking about the skills, experiences, and results that are directly related to the job you are applying for. 
 Avoid all complicated fonts or design elements.  To be considered an applicant, you will likely be uploading your resume to an applicant tracking system (ATS) on a company or third-party web site. These systems have a difficult time deciphering elaborate fonts or design elements and if your resume can’t be read easily, it won’t be read at all. 
 Quantify whenever possible.  We live in a metrics driven work culture and it’s no longer enough to state that you increased sales or productivity, you need to back it up with quantifiable data whenever possible. 
 Check your resumes for errors of fact, typos, formatting woes or omissions.  After you checked it and before you send it to an employer, let a trusted person in your network review it as well. One inaccuracy or misspelling could cost you a second look. 
 Omit any unnecessary, or potentially controversial, information,  including sexual orientation, religious or political affiliations. It’s illegal for employers to ask for this information and irrelevant to whether you are a strong candidate for the job. 
 “Size matters”  and no one has the time to spend a long time reviewing a resume. Keep the resume to one or two pages depending on your experience. If your resume is more than a page, be sure to include your name and email contact on subsequent pages and do your best early on to make sure the recruiter will want to read more!

 How to Dress for a Job Interview

 by Lauren Messiah 
 Nothing is more exciting than landing a job interview with a company or a person you really respect and admire. The emails or call comes, you jump up and down, you call your friends and family to share the news, you start visualizing your future at this magical company. 
 Then the panic sets in. 
 What are you going to wear? Do you buy a new outfit? Do you go conservative or do you show off your personal style? Should you get a haircut? What about your nails? 
 So many questions, so much stress. Lucky for you, I have all the answers. 
 1.)   It’s Better to Overdress than to Underdress.  When in doubt, dress up. No one can ever fault you for looking too good. Dressing up shows you respect yourself and the company you are interviewing for. 
 2.)   Keep Your Personal Style to a Minimum.  Are you known for wearing crazy hats or are you a real fan of nail art? That’s wonderful but there is no room for that during an interview. Show off your personal style with a great pair of shoes (closed toe), a bold colored handbag, or a statement necklace. I always say one conservative piece (a compliment inducing accessory) will do the trick. 
 3.)   Get Groomed.  You aren’t getting ready for prom but do set aside to get yourself together. Manicured nails and fresh blowout will not only make you feel more confident, potential employers take notice to how you care for yourself. 
 I know what you are thinking, all that talk is great but seriously, what do I wear? 
 And finally, I have just had to throw in these seemingly obvious no-nos … 
 
 NO cut off shorts.  I’ve had the extreme displeasure of interviewing a girl who wore cut off shorts 
 NO crazy makeup.  Save your YouTube tutorial makeup experiments for another day. Go natural and avoid bold lips- the chances of you getting lipstick on your teeth is too high. 
 NO crazy hairstyles.  Again, you are the star of the show – not your hair or your makeup. Keep your hair out of your face and “normal” 
 NO ill-fitting clothing.  Sure it fits the criteria style-wise for an interview outfit but if it doesn’t fit then it’s not perfect.

 Hitting the Team Member Trifecta

 In a recent conversation with an organizational psychologist, I was asked, “What are the top three things you look for in the members of your management team?” That’s a big and important question. 
 Yet I was able to answer it quickly and easily: “Trustworthiness, compatibility, and talent.” The next sentence I uttered might surprise you; it surprised me. Without really thinking, I followed up my four-word sentence about what I look for in the people who make up my management team with these three words: “In that order.” 
 And I stand by my answer. After the meeting concluded, I thought a lot about what the psychologist had asked and even more about my answer. And the more I considered it, the more certain I was that my answer was accurate. Trustworthiness, compatibility, and talent are the three things I consider most important in the people on my team. I’m not saying they’re the only answers or even the right answers. They’re just the right answers for me. 
 Trustworthiness 
 If you’ve read much of what I write about leadership, you know trust is a common theme. I’ve been on enough teams to know that trust is a critical element of success—in fact, I think it’s the most important. I don’t believe a team can function properly without it. 
 Team members must believe that their teammates can and will do their job so the team will succeed. They must trust that their teammates will put the team’s interest and success above their own. They must trust that their teammates will join with them to tackle even the most difficult circumstances. Sure, like everything else, trust is easy when things are good. But when the going gets difficult, do the members of your team trust one another? So trustworthiness tops my list. If people aren’t worthy of their teammates’ trust, then they don’t have a place on the team. 
 Compatibility 
 The second item on my list is compatibility. I believe you must like and respect the people with whom you work. I hear people say they don’t care whether or not they like their coworkers, but I don’t buy it. Life’s too short to spend it with people you don’t like. 
 If you work a regular 40-hour workweek for 52 weeks a year, you’ll spend more than 2,000 hours with your coworkers. Most of us spend as much time with our coworkers as we spend with our families. Do you really want to spend that time with people you don’t like? I don’t. And more important, a team in which the members don’t like one another is much less likely to succeed. They call this “team chemistry.” It’s hard to define, but when you have it, you know it. There’s a certain amount of momentum that comes from a team with chemistry that you don’t find in a team without it. Compatibility is critical for a team to succeed. 
 Talent 
 Third on my list is talent. Some might take exception with talent falling into third place, but I stand by my answer. You see, I don’t care if you’re the most talented person for any specific role—if you aren’t trustworthy or compatible with the other members of the team, you aren’t going to help the team. Period. Does that mean talent isn’t important? Of course not. But I want the most talented person I can find who is also trustworthy and fits well with my team. 
 I’ve had people who are incredibly bright, experienced, and talented but fail because they don’t fit with the team. Either their teammates didn’t trust them or they weren’t compatible with the team. It’s like a body that rejects an organ. The team will reject that person—regardless of his or her abilities—if the person doesn’t meet the other two criteria. So is talent important? Yes, incredibly so. It’s just not the most important. 
 If you consider this short list, you’ll see just how hard it is to find the right people for your team. You don’t need to find only trustworthy people. You need trustworthy people who are compatible with the other members of your team—and are the most talented you can find while still possessing the traits necessary to fulfill the first two criteria. You’re looking to hit the trifecta. Ask any gambler just how hard that is.

 Q&A on Job Description Creation

 by Mary Anne Kennedy 
 Job descriptions aren't merely lists of qualifications and duties. To the contrary, they are active documents by which you determine who you will hire, and how you will evaluate and compensate the people who will eventually fill those jobs. Getting them right takes time and a good understanding of what they're trying to accomplish. 
 Q. How do you determine the level of education and years of work experience required for a job? 
 A. That's a good question. You have to really know what it is you're going to be expecting. A rule of thumb is that an entry-level position may not even have a year of experience. But a managerial role will need experience. That person, for example, may need to have 3-5 years of experience, but the exact number will depend on what that manager will need to do. The higher the position and the more people responsibilities will mean more experience is required. It can even be 7-10 years of experience for a managerial position, on average. But it really depends on the level of the position you're posting. 
 Q. Can you substitute equivalent experience for education? 
 A. Yes. It depends on the situation you're facing and the competition and whether you're bringing in the level of talent you need. The other piece to it is this: if the person doesn't have the degree but can still do the job, that's great, but will they be able to advance in the organization? The people that they will be competing with will likely have the education. You can allow experience instead of education, but don't set up your new employees for future failure if you really do require the education. 
 Q. My understanding is that employers are better off if the physical requirements are listed on the job description. What do you recommend? 
 A. I think you're absolutely right. You want to be able to confirm that someone can do the job without directly asking about any disabilities. If you've listed the specific physical requirements – such as lifting 50 lbs, walking specific distances, etc. – then you can ask directly whether or not the person is capable of performing all of the duties in the job description. 
 The other related item to include is the work schedule. When people are told the schedule and what will be expected, and they explain which items they can and cannot commit to in terms of the schedule, then the company can determine whether it will work. But every time you put something in there that is very specific about what the job requires, you're better off because it provides proof that the employee knew the expectations.

 The most basic failure in hiring hasn’t changed for decades: Looking before you know what you are looking for. 
 Basic #1. 
 You have to know what you are looking for. 
 Hiring managers are always in a hurry to hire, hire, hire, but when you rush, you make mistakes that lead to bad hires. 
 Slow down and make sure that the hiring manager (and you in HR) knows what he or she is looking for. Typical problems: 
 
 Focusing on incumbent.  Don’t be swayed by the last person in the job. “Get me someone just like Terry.” That’s not going to happen. Say what you want. Think through what the job requires, not what any particular person brought to it. 
 Failing to realize that the job has changed.  Don’t just drag out an old job description or an old ad and push it out again. Has the job changed? Many jobs have, especially as technology takes over in many areas. For example, maybe there’s a loan officer who used to have a very important and critical job—analyzing clients creditworthiness. But today, the computer does the analysis. That’s a new job, no matter what the title. 
 Failing to look into the future.  What’s in store for the department where the new person will work? New technologies coming in? New responsibilities as a result of a merger? Factor likely future changes into your requirements list. 
 
 Basic #2. 
 You have to develop a way of describing the job that will attract candidates. 
 For example, if you just say, “looking for an accountant,” that’s not too attractive. You might do better starting, “Join a team of highly qualified accountants working on defining new approaches to financial analysis.” 
 Basic #3. 
 At the same time, in this world of thousands of resumes, you have to let interested jobseekers self-select out of the running.
