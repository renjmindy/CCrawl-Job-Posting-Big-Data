 Work It Daily 
 July 08, 2013 
 
 About The Book 
 The concept of work-life balance continues to elude our society as thousands of workers complain of 'living to work' instead of 'working to live.' It's no secret that career satisfaction eludes much of the American working population, but what's worse is the lack of resources and coaching to help today's employee find the career satisfaction they seek. In this innovative, step-by-step guide, workplace expert, professional development specialist, and nationally syndicated career advice columnist J.T. O'Donnell unlocks the secrets to working smarter when it comes to creating a career you can get excited about.
