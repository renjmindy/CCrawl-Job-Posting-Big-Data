 Specifically we seek a candidate with the following skills and attributes: 
 - experienced in all aspects of chasing overdue accounts via phone, email and other legal correspondence. 
 - account reconciliations 
 - cash allocation 
 - dealing with customer queries in a timely and professional manner 
 - monitoring varying levels of risk across the ledger 
 - liaising with internal managers to ensure billing issues are resolved quickly and accurately 
 - updating customer accounts 
 - good Excel knowledge 
 This is a great opportunity for a candidate with a passion for credit control, query resolution and complex reconciliations, ideally with experience in a deadline-driven environment, where attention to detail is a vital attribute. 
 Please call Jo Payne ASAP to discuss on 07813 608579.
