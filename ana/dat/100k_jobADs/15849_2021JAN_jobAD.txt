 About Gousto 
 Founded in 2012 by Timo Boldt, Gousto is on a mission to change the way that people cook. We believe home cooking is important, so we’ve made it simple. We take the hassle out of planning, shopping and cooking, by delivering weekly meals with precisely measured ingredients and easy-to-follow recipes, so there’s no more ‘what’s for dinner' panic. 
 As one of the most dynamic and fast-growing start-ups in the UK, Gousto currently leads the category offering more choice, more delivery options and lower lead times than any of its competitors. This is really only the beginning though, we have big plans to transform our proposition in 2020 and beyond. 
 The Role 
 To support and help shape this growth from an engineering team of ~60 to the ~130 we aim to be in 2022 we need to continue to invest in our Engineering Manager layer. This role will be critical to the business, not just by shaping significant growth but by 
 delivering on increased expectations and ambition. 
 The role will be accountable for the performance of 2-3 Engineering teams of between 5 and 9 people in size. Success in the role will mean leading your team in: 
 1. Ensuring Product Teams deliver on ambitious and stretching OKRs 
 2. Shaping our people and platform to support the growth ambitions of Gousto 
 3. Creating an environment and developing processes that promote both autonomy and accountability. 
 Beyond the accountability for the performance of their direct team, a standout candidate will be expected to contribute across the whole Engineering team in both the day to day and in the Technology strategy. This will require working closely and collaboratively with peers, the Gousto Tech Management Team and across the whole business. 
 A successful candidate for the role will need to have a strong intellectual curiosity, be able to drive change into a growing and maturing engineering team, and challenge their teams to always be improving. Constantly driving and searching for continuous 
 improvement/best practice in a lean, asynchronous and distributed environment. Our ideal candidate will have experience in high growth technology lead organisation. 
 Key Responsibilities 
 Building world class product engineering teams – We are just at the beginning of our journey and will be looking to significantly invest in engineering talent going forwards. Helping to build a truly great team of engineers will be a big part of what you do. 
 Continuing to evolve our Agile & Lean development process – Our teams have a lot of flexibility in the methodologies they use to deliver. We’re strong believers in creating space and autonomy for team, however we will always be looking to drive key messages and best practices from Agile & Lean and will look to our Engineering Managers to drive the accountability to create value for our customers into their teams. 
 Obsessing over quality & performance – As a leader of engineers you should obsess over the quality of what the team delivers. Whether that be the quality and maintainability of our code, the quality and impact of our features, or making sure we identify and squash every bug out there. 
 Promoting Gousto Technology in the wider industry – Gousto has a strong technology heart, with the department being a key stakeholder rather than execution engine. We need to do more to promote this across the industry abd become known as a go to technology destination. 
 Requirements 
 About the (ideal) candidate 
 
 Strong software engineering background in scalable distributed applications. 
 Experience leading high performing, autonomous product engineering teams in complex environments 
 A delivery mindset - We have a lot to do in a short space of time. 
 A fundamental understanding of the principles of Agile and Lean development. 
 Experience in architecting distributed systems on a public cloud platform. Ideally, you’ll have experience designing a Microservices platform on AWS (even better if you did it without servers!). 
 Worked within a DevOps organisation. At Gousto our developers are responsible for the operational health of the services they develop. We believe this fosters a great culture and are looking for someone who knows how to get the best from this.

 Excellent communication and presentation skills, whether to the engineering team, to business stakeholders or to our leadership team. 
 Experience working in a fast-paced, high growth, technology focussed organisation. 
 Proven experience of creating a forward-thinking technology culture. 
 
 What’s it really like to work here? 
 
 We are customer-centric, data driven and outcome focused, using lean principles to work iteratively, experiment and learn fast. 
 We work in cross-functional squads which we are increasingly include business partners. This allows us to work more closely with our colleagues in food, operations and marketing, enabling greater alignment, collaboration and innovation. 
 Our squads have a high level of autonomy to decide both what outcomes they should pursue and how they will achieve them. 
 We believe in being agile rather than committing to a single framework. We have a set of lean and agile principles which we follow, but beyond that squads are empowered and encouraged to tailor their working processes. 
 We discourage pigeon-holing which means our engineers are responsible for designing, writing, testing, deploying and maintaining their code in production. 
 We don’t have QAs, and our architect works closely with squads to consult and collaborate. 
 A devops culture is central to our way of working and our squads are responsible for running their solutions in production. 
 Pairing and TDD are practices we champion and want to keep improving. 
 10% of our time is dedicated to tech innovation and we hold regular brown bags. 
 We are committed to being involved in the wider tech community, hosting meetups,speaking at events and sharing learnings via our blog. 
 
 Benefits 
 At Gousto we are constantly looking to evolve our benefits for our people. Employees at Gousto are the key ingredient to our success and growth.

We have weekly Friday socials ranging from team updates, birthday celebrations, meetups and more. Soft drinks, beer, wine and more snacks included (well, we do love food).
