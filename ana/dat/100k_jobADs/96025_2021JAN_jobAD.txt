 Mr. Franza, 
 The said UK care jobs are for caregivers who are qualified to work in the UK. If you are qualified, then you can apply. There is another UK Jobs vacacy for caregivers, to know the details, just read my article titled UK Jobs in Care. But because of the huge number of applicants, be sure to check with the recruiting agency if the POEA Job Order for the said UK Jobs in Care is still active or not.
