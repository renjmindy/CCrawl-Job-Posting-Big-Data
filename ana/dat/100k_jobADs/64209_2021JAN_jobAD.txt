 RESERVATIONS FOR 6 AT 6:30 PM, Please. 
 Antipasto Platter - Yarra Glen Cafe and Store aka Cheesefreaks 
 I pick up the phone and call four or five of my closest friends. "Are you free Thursday night?" I ask. "Great" I say, "see you there." I mentally choose my outfit and plan on wearing a scarf that hides some of my face. No, I am not a private investigator; I don't work for the secret service. What I do, is eat. I am a restaurant critic (only for those foods that we, the common people eat). There is no escargot, snake meat, or goat in my meals. I'm the voice of the people, the regular people, not the elite. I go to restaurants with my husband, with friends, with nice people who I meet and we eat. We eat, we talk, I take bites from every dish and secretly write down notes. Sometimes, I just specialize in dessert. Once home, I type up my notes, drink chilled CVS diet black cherry club soda and head to bed. My stomach is full and I am extraordinarily happy. Goodnight.
