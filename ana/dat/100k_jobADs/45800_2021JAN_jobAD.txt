  How To Manage Career Uncertainty  
 Aaron Sanborn 
 January 13, 2021 
   
 In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic greatly disrupted the economy and resulted in layoffs at multiple businesses. 
 It also served as a reminder to professionals that your employment status can change in an instant. 
 No matter how established and comfortable you are in your career, uncertainty can always be around the corner and there are things that you can do to prepare yourself for these situations. 
 Be Honest With Yourself 
 From time to time, it's important to ask yourself,  "Am I happy with my career?" The answer to this question tells you whether you should be building a  career plan  strategy for your current profession, or if you need to shift gears and get yourself ready for a career change. Every job is temporary! People change, businesses change, and obviously the economy is always changing. The key is to have a good idea of the direction that you want to go in if you find yourself dealing with a job loss. Do you want to continue down a similar career path, or make a change? 
 Make Yourself An Indispensable Employee 
 One of the most consistent pieces of advice that we give at Work It Daily is the importance of showing value at your job. Employees who consistently find ways to save or make the company money have a way of making  themselves indispensable . But beyond that, showing a strong work ethic and commitment to your job are all traits that employers value, and they help you build a reputation as an exceptional employee. Even if the worst-case scenario occurred and you still lost your job at some point, all of these accomplishments and traits can be used to market yourself when you're hunting for a new job. Be sure to use numbers and statistics  on your resume to quantify  how you made your previous company more efficient and profitable, and keep in touch with former colleagues and supervisors who can vouch for you as a good employee. Making yourself indispensable may not work 100% of the time, but it's never a wasted effort because your accomplishments will speak for your work ethic and character, and will help you land on your feet. 
 Embrace Career Growth 
 It's important to be a lifelong learner, both in your professional and personal life. Professionally, while it's important to be in the present and focus on your core job responsibilities, it's also important to keep an eye towards the future and think about ways your role can expand. You sometimes hear stories about managers asking job candidates where they want to be in 10 years and the candidate answering  "I want your job!"  While this isn't the ideal way to answer this interview question, it's good to have that type of ambition. Career growth is a multi-step process that starts with excelling at your primary position and then taking on additional responsibilities. From there, it's about gaining the confidence to bring ideas to the table about expanding your role and then seeking  opportunities for promotion . Those who are willing to grow their careers position themselves well in times of uncertainty. But once again, if you do happen to lose your job, this willingness to learn will serve you well on the job search, and impress potential employers. Always be on the lookout for  ways to upskill . 
 Make A Career Change 
 If you're no longer happy with your career, chances are you aren't doing everything you need to do to grow it, and your job may be vulnerable in times of uncertainty. Making a change will not only be a good move for your own happiness, but it's also the better long-term career move. Sometimes career uncertainty and job loss is the push many professionals need to make a change.  Career change  isn't an easy process, but if you take some time to learn and commit to the process, it can be very rewarding. The good news is Work It Daily can help!

  4 Simple Career Resolutions For 2021  
 Aaron Sanborn 
 December 16, 2020 
   
 Everyone has heard of New Year's resolutions. You know those promises that we make to ourselves about things that we'll do better in the year ahead. Sometimes these resolutions work, while other times we end up with gym memberships we never use! 
 But, have you ever heard of a career resolution? It's actually the same thing as a New Year's resolution, only career-focused. 
 However, with something as important as a career, you don't want to break these resolutions. That's why it's important to keep these goals manageable. Here are four simple career resolutions that are easy to stick to and achieve. 
 Be Self-Aware Of Where You Stand In Your Career 
 Being honest and self-aware of where you are in your career is the most important step in making strong career resolutions. If your career is going nowhere and you're unhappy, then it may be time to consider a  career change , which will take you down a different path entirely. But, if you're happy and in good standing with your career, it's a lot easier to set goals for the year, and build out a long-term career plan. 
 Find A Way To Grow Your Career 
 Career growth is a very broad spectrum that means something different to everyone. It could be something as simple as improving on a weakness, or building on a strength. It could also be learning a new skill or taking on additional responsibilities at work. On a larger level, it could be seeking a promotion or moving into a  leadership role . Whatever the goal is, make sure it includes growing professionally.  The worst thing that you can do is stay the same! If you're not growing your career, you're dying, and becoming a lot less valuable to your company.  There are always  ways to upskill ! 
 Better Serve Your Professional Network 
 With current colleagues, former colleagues, and other professional acquaintances, you've probably built a solid professional network through the years. A strong professional network can really come in handy if you lose your job or are looking to make a career change.  However, you shouldn't just rely on your network when you're in need! It's important to find ways to offer  value to your network . This could include checking in with members of your network from time to time. Exchange messages on LinkedIn to see how they're doing or share relevant content of interest. If you can help someone in your network going through a career challenge, you should! Maintaining a  strong professional network  is like an investment. If you want it to pay off, you have to put some time into it and be consistent. 
 Take Care Of Yourself 
 Working on your career is hard work! It's okay to be selfish sometimes. Whether you're working to grow your career, or on the job hunt, it's important to find balance. Your family and health always come first, so make sure your career goals don't interfere with that.  If you want to  set aside time  during the week to work on your career that's fine, but don't miss an important family events or milestones. Don't let your career goals get in the way of your health goals. Go to the gym, take a walk, or go for a jog. Balance is key to maintaining healthy career and life goals. Sometimes you just need to adjust that balance as you go. Need help accomplishing your career resolutions? You're in luck!
