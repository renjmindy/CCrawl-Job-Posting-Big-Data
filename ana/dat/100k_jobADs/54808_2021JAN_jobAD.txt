  I Don't Have Enough Experience To Land My Dream Job!  
 Work It Daily 
 January 07, 2010 
 Dear Experts, I am in job search mode, and have decided to take the opportunity to transition into another field. It is a role I have performed in the past but not titled. Advised by professionals/experts in the field, that it is feasible. However, although my targeted resume has gotten to the hiring managers, and even some interviews, I do not get offer. I don't have enough experience to land my dream job. How do I find the right balance? I don't want to give up on this new dream!  Here is how our CAREEREALISM-Approved Experts answered this question on Twitter:   Q#411  If you need to sell previous experience as relevant to the new jobs, make them more prominent on your resume. (@ gradversity )  Q#411  Start volunteering with nonprofits in the field you want to work in. Get experience (work for free). (@ beneubanks )  Q#411  Be sure your resume wows hiring managers your skills, abilities, and knowledge. You can also consider OJT or volunteer. (@ MarySevinsky )  Q#411  Networking gets more than rez, but make sure rez shines. Come in w/ 30/60/90 plan, wow them w/ what ur ready to do. (@ ResumeStrategy )  Q#411  If exp truly an issue, take a "lesser" job in the same field and "volunteer" for larger projects to expand expertise. (@ DawnBugni )  Q#411  Perhaps interview skills need polishing. If YOU don't convey you can do the job, company won't think U can do it either. (@ DawnBugni )  Our Twitter Advice Project (T.A.P.) is no longer an active campaign. To find an answer to the above question, please use the "Search" box in the right-hand column of this website.
