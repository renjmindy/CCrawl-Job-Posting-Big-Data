  Risks And Rewards Of Taking A Job You Don't Want  
 Ariella Coombs

 There are going to be times in your career when you NEED to take a job. Whether it's because you need a paycheck or you just need more experience, you're going to have to take on roles you're less than thrilled about taking at some point in your career. But what are the risks and rewards of taking a job you don't want? 
 
 Risks 
 What are some of the risks of taking a job you don't want? Well, you might hate it and/or feel chained to it for the paycheck or for some other reason. It might also be a dead end job that won't get you any closer to your goals. That's why it's very important to evaluate the pros and cons beforehand. 
 Rewards 
 The good news is that every job is temporary. You're not tied to one role for the rest of your life. In fact, these days, you have more wiggle room than ever. According to a  recent study , professionals will likely change jobs at least four times before they turn 32. So, have no fear. You're not locked in for good. However, when you take a job, you should always be thinking about what that job can do for your career as a whole. How will it help you get to your next step? According to J.T. O'Donnell, founder and CEO of Work It Daily, if a job lets you focus on certain skill sets, allows you to work with high-profile clients, gives you a foot in the door at a company, or just allows you to break into a new industry, it will allow you to keep moving forward in your career, even if it's not your dream job. “Think of it as a working education," said O'Donnell. “.... Anytime a job is going to give you a skill set or an experience that you know you're going to be able to leverage big time in the future, it's worth it to consider taking that role for a couple of years, even if you don't absolutely love what you're doing." So, when you're evaluating the pros and cons of taking a job you don't want, make a list of both. However, keep in mind what you can get out of this role, even if it's not your ideal job.
