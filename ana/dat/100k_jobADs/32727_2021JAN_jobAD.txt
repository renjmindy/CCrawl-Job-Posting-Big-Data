 This is a [full-time/part-time] position requiring approximately [e.g. 40] hours per week. Your regular weekly schedule will be [e.g. Monday to Friday 09:00-17:00.]. 
 Employment Relationship 
 Employment with the Company is for no specific period of time. Your employment with the Company will be “at will,” meaning that either you or the Company may terminate your employment at any time and for any reason, with or without cause. Any contrary representations that may have been made to you are superseded by this letter agreement. This is the full and complete agreement between you and the Company on this term. Although your job duties, title, compensation and benefits, as well as the Company’s personnel policies and procedures, may change from time to time, the “at will” nature of your employment may only be changed in an express written agreement signed by you and a duly authorized officer of the Company (other than you).

 The Company will pay you a starting salary at the rate of $[Gross annual salary] per year, payable in accordance with the Company’s standard payroll schedule, beginning [start day] and you will receive your first pay on [date.] This salary will be subject to adjustment pursuant to the Company’s employee compensation policies in effect at the time.

 You are encouraged to obtain your own tax advice regarding your compensation from the Company.

 III. Bonus potential 
 In addition, you will be eligible to be considered for an incentive bonus for each fiscal year of the Company. The bonus (if any) will be awarded based on objective or subjective criteria established by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and approved by the Company’s Board of Directors. Your target bonus will be equal to [%] of your annual base salary. Any bonus for the fiscal year in which your employment begins will be prorated, based on the number of days you are employed by the Company during that fiscal year. Any bonus for a fiscal year will be paid within [number] months after the close of that fiscal year, but only if you are still employed by the Company at the time of payment. The determinations of the Company’s Board of Directors with respect to your bonus will be final and binding.

 Training 
 As part of our professional development initiative for all employees, you will be eligible for an annual training budget.

The Option will be subject to the terms and conditions applicable to options granted under the Company’s Stock Plan (as adopted, the “Plan”), as described in the Plan and the applicable Stock Option Agreement. You will be able to vest in 25% of the Option shares after 12 months of continuous service, and the balance will vest in equal monthly installments over the next 36 months of continuous service, as described in the applicable Stock Option Agreement. 
 V. Privacy and confidentiality agreements 
 Privacy Agreement 
 You are required to observe and uphold all of the Company’s privacy policies and procedures as implemented or varied from time to time. Collection, storage, access to and dissemination of employee personal information will be in accordance with privacy legislation.

This letter agreement may not be amended or modified, except by an express written agreement signed by both you and a duly authorized officer of the Company.
