 MORE THAN A JOB 
 
 TEAM 
 We achieve our goals together by using our expert knowledge as a team. We value on technological skills as well as human and social competences. In our everyday life we combine work with fun. At the same time, collegiality and respect strengthen our team. Whenever all colleagues get together, events are celebrated, and the time spent together is used for casual chat over beer or wine. In addition, we live the team spirit digitally by using internal apps, WhatsApp groups, podcasts, Twitter and Yammer as community tools and share all the news about virtual7 with each other. 
 
 FAMILIY 
 We are not only employees, but also parents and we are very happy that there are no set core working hours or fixed office hours. We use the flexibility we have gained as a result to arrange our working hours in a sensible and family-friendly manner. The contact to the families of our colleagues is also important to us and so not only all colleagues but also our families, partners and children are invited to Christmas parties and barbecues. In addition, there is a virtual7 Family Day, where over 20 children will guarantee a lot of fun - including attractions such as a bouncy castle and childcare. 
 
 SPORT & HEALTH 
 Everyone needs an appropriate balance in their work. This is why prevention and health promotion are particularly important to us. We are not professional athletes or fitness gurus, but we know how to clear the head together and get a good workout. Of course, this is promoted by virtual7, which means that there are always colleagues coming together to go for a run, bike, play squash, or play football. On the team days, exercise and sports activities are on the agenda, as well as the professional exchange with colleagues. 
 
 EDUCATION & TRAINING 
 The personal development of each member of the team is driven by our high-quality standards. We have scheduled training periods and the opportunity to shape individual development on our own responsibility. Our feedback and development model provide a framework for the exchange between the executive and the employee regarding personal and professional development. In addition, we provide a personal budget for external further training. 
 
 TRAVEL 
 As a consultant, you travel a lot in your everyday life. For us, travel time is considered working time and is linked to overtime compensation. Whether we are on the way to customers, community events, trade fairs, conferences, or meetings in one of our subsidiaries - we usually travel by car, train, or plane. Our office management supports us with travel planning and booking. 
 
 COMMUNITY 
 Anyone who unites such a great number of experts, is very popular in the communities, too. Our involvement in different communities serves as a platform for professional exchange, for gaining new ideas and solutions and for sharing our experiences with other experts. Throughout the year, you can find us at various conferences and trade fairs dealing with modern technologies. Also, we are consulted by ORACLE through our Platinum Partnership and are allowed to test and evaluate products and technologies even before they are released.
