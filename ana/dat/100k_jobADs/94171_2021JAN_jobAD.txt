  Do I Tell Current Employer I'm Looking for New Job?  
 Work It Daily 
 June 15, 2009 
 Dear Experts, I'm an office administrator at my current place of employment. However, I am currently looking for an internship or new job opportunity. I’m afraid when an opportunity comes along, I won’t be able to give my company more than two weeks notice at best (the interior design field is highly competitive). My husband is also familiar with my work situation and thinks that my company may take mean advantage of the advance notice. I’m afraid they may be angry if I only give them two weeks notice. Should I make my company aware I am looking so that they can prepare for my separation?  Here is how our T.A.P. experts answered this question:   @dawnbugni   Q#162  Goodness NOOOOOO. Keep your search confidential - period. You're in charge of your career not them. (1of2)  @louise_fletcher   Q#162  No! Tell them if and when you have accepted another job offer and not before.  @dawnbugni   Q#162  Could backfire or result in immediate termination. 2 wks notice sufficient. They won't give U layoff notice.  @jtodonnell   Q#162  NO, NO, NO! Don't say you're looking to leave. Good co's don't react negatively to 2wks. It's part of biz.  @ValueIntoWords   Q#162  Echo others: Never hint that ur searching other jobs. Current emplyr will b obliged to find ur replacement.  @beneubanks   Q#162  2 weeks=plenty unless you're a manager. If worried, don't give extra warning. Start x-training other EEs.  @juliaerickson   Q#162  Don't tell them; they may fire u b4 u find new job; 2 wks sufficient notice; look out 4 urself, not them.  @DebraWheatman   Q#162  Do not reveal this. It could take some time. Employer could terminate you immediately if they find out.  @gradversity   Q#162  Don't share this information with your employer. If you get a new offer, they should understand that 2 weeks is standard.  @resumesrevealed   Q#162  Echo experts - u shld absolutely keep ur search confidential. Wait til u have accepted another offer!  @heatherhuhman :  Q#162  Agree wholeheartedly w/other experts. No reason to notify until you have a confirmed offer in hand.
