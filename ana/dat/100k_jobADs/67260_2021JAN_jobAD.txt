 How to get hired when you're just starting or re-starting your career  
 11/4/2013

 Carly read this article:  http://news.yahoo.com/hired-youre-just-starting-career-150710348.html 
 Carly's comments: I thought the article was very beneficial and will share it with the Tacoma Job Club (group of unemployed people) that meets every Wednesday from 10 am to noon. 
 Interesting to find that adding blogging activities to your resume aside from volunteer, if you don't have work experience to add. 
 I like the part about a cover letter should tell the employer why you want the job NOT a job. Desperation is never attractive. 
 I am a huge support of LinkedIn. I just joined this past June and have really grown my profile and connections. I love LinkedIn. It's VERY easy to use. 
 Yes, networking is very important. It's how 3/4 of people get jobs. But, can networking really be taught to someone? It reminds me when I was in the business school at UW Tacoma, one of my textbooks said you can't really teach people how to be nice. The point in that textbook was that you could train people with great personalities skills, but someone who had the skills but not a good personality, you couldn't really teach them how to be nice. :) 
 **What are your comments? I'd love to see them!
