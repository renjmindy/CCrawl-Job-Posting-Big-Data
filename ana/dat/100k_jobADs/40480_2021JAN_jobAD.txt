 Skin type: Normal to dry 
 Hello! 
 Lux India just recently launched their Botanicals Soap Range in 3 variants. The one that I am reviewing today is the Sunflower and Jojoba Oil, that I have been using daily for nearly 2 weeks now. So let's get on with the review and see how this one fared out for me. Keep reading‚Ä¶ 
 What The Brand Claims  : Lux Botanicals Collection, A Luxurious Everyday Experience for Your Senses Where Nature is Supreme, and Beauty is Celebrated! Fly away to a carefree secret wonderland. Dance through the endless field of sparkling blossoms and wrap yourself in an irresistible sparkling glow. 
 Nourishing Jojoba oil- often called ‚Äúliquid wax‚Äù because it has a structure similar to your skin oils, jojoba oil deeply moisturizes and hydrates your skin, giving nutrition for your dry skin. Sparkling Sunflower- thousands of florets come together to make a gorgeous sunflower bloom. Bright and luminous, the sunflower will shower your world with its sparkling and subtly sweet fragrance. 
 New Glycerin Soap Bar with 100% Organic Glycerin Gel, Ultra Hydrating and Good for Body and Face. A gentle Botanical Formulation. Indulge in natural skin treat that is free from nasty chemicals. Experience Luminously bright and supple skin that is perfumed with exquisite Natural Scent. Find yourself in a royal English garden immersed in fragrant wonders. Try Our Lux Botanicals. 
 Packaging  : The brand has done a great job with the packaging here! It is simple, yet attractive! The soap comes in a beautiful plastic packaging with yellow sunflowers all over. All the important details such as date of manufacturing, use-before date, MRP, ingredient list and net product weight are clearly mentioned. And, it is travel-friendly too! 
 Ingredient List  : 
 My Experience With The Product  : Lux Botanicals Soap Bar With Sunflower And Jojoba Oil has a unique texture! The brand says that this is a glycerin-based product that is made from 100% organic glycerin gel. Now I usually prefer cream-based soaps than gel-based ones, but this one's formula is just amazing! It is a dream to work with and produces a rich lather. It effectively gets the job done and cleanses the body. The skin instantly feels clean, soft and thoroughly refreshed. 
 The product is quick and easy to rinse and comes off in one go. It does not leave any residue behind whatsoever and does not dry out the skin either, which is impressive! Another reason why I loved this soap so much is because of its fragrance! It has a citrusy scent that is absolutely fantastic and oh-so refreshing. The product is free from parabens and silicones and can be easily found online as well as in stores. 
 Yays!
