 Awards and Terrific Kids 
 June 9, 2011June 10, 2011   Nye 
 This is the last week of school for Lee and Friday is her last day for this school year. Bo and I went to her third grade skits and awards program on Wednesday morning. Lee had a few lines for the skits and it was about the Statue of Liberty. I think her proudest award…  Continue reading Awards and Terrific Kids

 Living in America 
 March 25, 2011March 27, 2011   Nye 
 I'm glad I don't work for a CPA firm, otherwise it wouldn't be a Spring season at my house but more like a Tax season. If you haven't filed your 2010 taxes, you still have time and surprisingly some of my co-workers didn't know that you can still make a deductible retirement contribution such as…  Continue reading Living in America

 Lee and I went to her school Winter Fest. It seems odd to have it during this time of the year since Spring has arrived in our area. Lee decided to have her hair color, they hosed her down good with color hairspray. It's blue with sparkles. They have lots of games and she won…  Continue reading Saturday Random Photos

 Lao School Building Project Updates 
 February 24, 2011February 25, 2011   Nye 
 It has been a while since I last updated about Ban Dannavieng Elementary School. This is the school in Laos that many had come together in helping with the school building project in 2007. I received a photo update from Darly of the school today. The school is now known as Dong Yang Primary School,…  Continue reading Lao School Building Project Updates

 Travel Photography: A Visit to ECU 
 August 31, 2010January 23, 2011   Nye 
 This is a contribution to Scott Thomas Photography’s photo essay: Travel Photography. We decided to head down the East Coast on Sunday morning, and only if we drove further we would be at the beach by now but our schedule didn’t allow us to do that, our destination was to visit Bo’s nephew Tom, whom…  Continue reading Travel Photography: A Visit to ECU

 Tom Keoboupha Graduating Class of 2010 
 June 12, 2010January 24, 2011   Nye 
 Today I have a guest blogger. Guest blogger Bo: First I want to congratulate my nephew Tom Keoboupha for his success. Tom is the middle of 3 boys and I heard so much from my oldest sister of how smart he is. I was impressed with his speech and proud that he was the President…  Continue reading Tom Keoboupha Graduating Class of 2010

 Education That Works 
 August 13, 2009August 13, 2009   Nye 
 Send Me An Angel by Scorpions Have you ever wondered why there are so many young novice monks in Laos, especially in Luang Prabang? Our Buddhist faith in Laos is not as strict as the Myanmar, where it’s their tradition that every Myanmar Buddhist boy average age between 7 and 13 is expected to enter…  Continue reading Education That Works

 Dannavieng Elementary School Update 
 March 3, 2009February 24, 2011   Nye 
 When I visited Dannavieng Elementary school in November 20, 2008, I didn’t get to meet the superintendent of the school. After I came back, Darly informed me that she will get me the receipt, something that I needed to provide for Friends of the NLL, also known as my coworkers that had helped supported the…  Continue reading Dannavieng Elementary School Update

 Lathsene Schoolkids 
 January 12, 2009January 24, 2011   Nye 
 Video by Boon Vong, from his trip to Laos. The preschool location was in Xieng Khouang Province, one of the most bombed areas in Laos, and one of the poorest. The region also has the sad honor of being first in bombie farming accidents. Lathesene village lacked running water but the schoolchildren and villagers treated…  Continue reading Lathsene Schoolkids

 A Special Gift, a Gift of Knowledge 
 July 1, 2008April 21, 2009   Nye 
 I've had opportunity to give the gift of knowledge to children in Laos, books are very special to me, and might be because I didn’t have many growing up, and now I often buy books for myself. I could imagine the excitement of these children at Dannavieng Elementary School when they received their books box,…  Continue reading A Special Gift, a Gift of Knowledge
