 Health Check for an English teaching job in China 
 
 If youâ€™ve landed a job in China, you will need to undergo a pre-departure medical checkup in your country. 
 Such checks are a requirement of the Chinese entry-exit bureau and must be carried out in a government-recognized hospital. 
 As with all visa-related issue, there are conflicting stories about how and where you can have your examination carried out. 
 Pre-Departure Medical Check 
 Most schools require you to complete the following  Physical Examination Record Form  whilst still in your home country. 
 
 We recommend going to see your Doctor/ GP to ask them to complete the form as fully as possible. 
 A Doctor should be able to complete the majority of the form from your records without having to perform additional tests. 
 In our experience, the form can be completed as follows and will be accepted by  most  provincial visa offices in China: 
 â€¢ The first page should be relatively easy for your doctor to complete; 
 â€¢ On the second page, in the top box, a comment such as â€˜normalâ€™ is sufficient; 
 â€¢ In the chest x-ray and ECG boxes, comment â€˜not applicableâ€™; 
 â€¢ The final box should include a comment stating that you are fit; 
 â€¢ Ask your doctor to then sign the form with a stamp from your doctorsâ€™ surgery/ medical center/ hospital 
 â€¢ You will also be required to attach a recent passport photo stamped by the doctor or issuing authority 
 This information regarding the medical check is purely a guide, and only for reference; the process of getting a general health check may differ from country to country, so please google the information on how to undergo a basic check if this form cannot be completed. 
 Remember that often you will be required to gain a further medical checkup once you arrive in China, even if you have also had to complete this in your home country. 
 In-China Medical check 
 Once in China, if you have traveled on a Z working visa or are in the process of applying for one, you will be required to have an in-country medical check. 
 This will always take place within the first 30 days of arrival in China; sometimes employers prefer to get it out of the way quickly, so be prepared to potentially have it in your first or second week! 
 It is a relatively simple procedure, that depending on the number of people being processed, will take between 30-60 minutes start to finish. 
 Multiple people will be â€˜processedâ€™ simultaneously, and it is very efficient. 
 Itâ€™s absolutely nothing to be concerned about! 
 Before your medical check it is important to you remember to: 
 
 Skip breakfast the morning of the medical check 
 Continue to take any prescribed medication and take it with you to the exam so any Doctors are aware 
 Dress sensibly and comfortably. As X-rays will be conducted itâ€™s not a good idea to wear a skirt or dress. 
 
 Your employer will accompany you to a country-level government hospital for the medical check. You will be required to take the following with you: 
 
 Your passport 
 Photocopies of passport material pages including; picture and information page, visa page, entry stamp page 
 5 passport-style photos. Very often your employer will take you to a government authorized photography shop before-hand, these are always located close by or next to government hospitals and Public Security Bureaus 
 The medical check fee (this is usually a little over 400RMB, often your employer will pay) 
 
 The Medical is carried out on behalf of The Ministry of Public Health and the Ministry of Public Security. 
 They will be checking for the following throughout your Medical Check:  Influenza, Poliomyelitis, Malaria, Dengue fever, Relapsing fever, Epidemic typhus HIV and AIDS, Hepatitis B, Plague, Cholera, Yellow fever and other infectious diseases required for disclosure by the State Council. 
 Entry and residence will be denied for those testing positive or showing condition of any of the above in addition to: Severe Psychosis, Infectious Tuberculosis disease, and any other physical or mental conditions, deemed to be a threat to Chinaâ€™s health and safety standards. 
 Youâ€™ll usually be required to go to different rooms for the following examinations: 
 
 Blood test with sterile needles and gloves 
 Urine Test 
 Ultrasound 
 ECG 
 Blood pressure check 
 Pulse regularity check 
 Stethoscope check for breathing regularity 
 X-Rays (usually of the torso) 
 Vision test 
 Height and Weight check 
 
 The follow-up Health Certificate will usually take a couple of working days to process following your check. 
 All being well, your employer will register this with the authorities. 
 If you have any related questions, feel free to comment and we will help you out!
