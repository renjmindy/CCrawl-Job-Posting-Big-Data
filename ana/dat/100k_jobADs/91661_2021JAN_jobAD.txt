 Flowers have helped me to redefine what humility actually is, she said, we wanted to learn more -> 
 Beautiful flower you are, even if you had been overlooked for that job, your inner joy about who you are will take way further than that job into some thing deliciously wonderful…. Start with daily gratitude for the gift of this situation,what it's exposed and be for giving release of that pain and replace it with the sheer pleasure of valuing you

 Beloved Flower Lover, 
 We received a note from a dear reader recently about how our work had been helping her to rethink how she looked at herself despite the negative feelings she felt about being overlooked for promotion seemingly ignoring her being very good at her job. We asked if we could share a snippet of our response. She agreed so here goes. 
 
 Ahhh, beautiful you. 
 You have "Illuminated" some shadows within your experience. Where you were blind, now you see. That's true inner work.Inner renewal of your inner garden. 
 
 
 And yes, trying to be humble in the business world will keep you broke. Please choose to believe in and appreciate you. Please continue to use flowers to articulate what makes you feel marvellous! Because you are. The may you communicate about your love of flowers in your note to us tells us here that you have an amazing artistic mind and beautiful inner expression. You are able to pull us into your experience when you are writing. We bet you would be an amazing florist if you so chose to do so. 
 
 
 But the first order of rewiring your mind is you MUST love and appreciate the highest expression that you are. Turning the daily focus on your job to an attitude of daily gratitude will have a powerful effect. Pat yourself on the back, speak highly of yourself. Be confident. And love the magnificent you that you are! 
 
 The Team, 
 The London Flower Lover

 About Thelondonflowerlover 
 Welcome to The London Flower Lover. We are florists who create floral collections to tell your real life story. With colour and texture, we take floristry into an entirely new direction based on the challenges and joys of your life. Offering what we call 'heart based floristry' we use style, fashion, and life situations and merge them with heart based lifestyle support. This inspiring blend creates so much more for those who love flowers. Using flowers in the traditional way of course, but always using flowers to open up a floralicious conversation about relationships of all kinds. We are a sort of work in progress of compassionately confirming how we are already on the inside, the love we want to see out in the world. That is mission of The London Flower Lover. So saying yes to recognising that is at the heart of this blog and using flowers to honour that inner world is how we use the beauty of giving and receiving flowers. This blog is your blog. It's as much about cultivating your heart, as it is about enjoying the physical beauty of flowers. It offers story, poems and video to reflect the life you actually live whilst showing beautifully inspiring collections of flower designs. Hand-tied bouquets, arrangements and more. All this with sought after tips from well established experts on how to keep a happy heart. This is what makes The London Flower Lover unique and magical. Yes, and that's how we make the difference that we do. When life looks, feels, or sounds challenging, we offer a sanctuary that you may dip into. A well of refreshment and strength that you may draw from. Sharing what others have found to be successful ways of being happy in the face of challenges, whilst letting flowers do the talking when we have no other way to interpret what is going on. Use flowers to help you re-discover, reveal and remember how you can still be despite challenges. Use flowers to celebrate and to embody the possibility of your heart felt desire, fulfilled. Use flowers in your life, to remind you of the beauty of your life. Use The London Flower Lover today. We invite you to stay curious in this floral universe as you explore the love in the heart. This is a floralicious world.
