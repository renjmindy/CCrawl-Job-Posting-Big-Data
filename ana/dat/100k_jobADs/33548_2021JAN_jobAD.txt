 German Minister: on behalf of animal exploitation and they do the job well 
 ](https://worldanimalsvoice.com/2020/10/16/german-minister-on-behalf-of-animal-exploitation-and-they-do-the-job-well/) 
 In Baden-Württemberg, south Germany, a slaughterhouse had to close due to severe animal welfare deficiencies. 
 According to media reports, the  Minister of Agriculture, Peter Hauk,   intervened personally to suspend the fine against the operator. 
 A bitter article about this scandal from the  SOKO animal welfare association 
(for those who don't remember:  https://worldanimalsvoice.com/2020/10/08/germany-slaughterhouse-scandal-turns-into-a-political-thriller/ ) 
 "…. a pig breeding business that was reported months ago, and where nothing happened. 
 A  slaughterhouse  whose shortcomings were known for years and which was last  personally protected by the Minister of Agriculture. 
 A slaughterhouse where the vets just watch how we do brutal force to the animals, 
 And  : A Minister Hauk who does not see himself in any responsibility here. 
 Actually, he's not far removed from tradition. Animal welfare - that has always been politically irrelevant. And the Ministry of Agriculture in particular is traditionally trying to make it easier for animal exploiters; animal welfare is systematically ignored and prevented. 
 The real scandal:  people have become so accustomed to the fact that the interests of animals are trampled underfoot that even Minister Hauk creates the trick of not feeling responsible even in these entanglements. 
 Ministries of Agriculture and their associated ministers have consistently campaigned AGAINST animals. 
They prevent the smallest concessions in animal welfare, enforce perpetual extension periods, and play into the hands of the animal exploitation industry. 
 These people act on behalf of animal exploitation and they do the job well ". 
 SOKO Tierschutz 
 And I mean … The district office had levied a fine against the slaughterhouse (which was closed in March 2020), which Minister Hauk suspended shortly thereafter. 
After SOKO's undercover investigation, pigs were brutally beaten and kicked, electric shock devices were used and the animals were stunned in an unprofessional and incorrect manner. The public prosecutor's office is informed and determined. 
 Nevertheless: three days ago, in front of the Agriculture Committee, where he had to give an account of this corrupt and illegal act, Hauk said: He was not aware of any animal welfare violations at the time!!! 
 Such system structures are not normal but can be described as psychopathic. Mentally, morally, socially healthy people with decency do not engage in such disgusting, exploitative business. 
 Nevertheless: this system is firmly established, it is an established ideology of violence, has the authority, and is supported by all-important social institutions. 
 Our parents, school, church, media, or other educational institutions persuade us that eating meat is normal, natural, and necessary. 
So we go on with it from childhood; without us, the animal holocaust would not exist. 
No meat consumption - no slaughterhouse 
 What exacerbates the whole matter is the fact that an animal is a "thing" by law, so cruelty to animals is often punished as property damage - if at all. 
 Black smokers' lungs are depicted on cigarette packets; How about dead pork or beef in an animal transport or a cow with its throat cut on the meat packaging? 
 But the meat mafia would never allow that. 
Everything indicates that the meat mafia is stronger than the tobacco mafia. 
 My best regards to all, Venus
