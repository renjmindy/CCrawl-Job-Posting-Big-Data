 Jobs: 2 Liaison Librarians 
 Posted on  September 13, 2017  by   sarahgprescott 
 4.3.17 –  Liaison Librarian: Undergraduate & First Year Experience 
 Liaison Librarian: College of Management & Technology 
Walden University, USA (remote/online positions) 
 Sarah P’s comments  : Walden listed 3 positions in 2015 and one previously in 2017. Walden is an established online university with “more than 47,800 students from all 50 states and more than 150 countries pursuing bachelor’s, master’s, or doctoral degrees”. However, the reviews on Glassdoor are mixed. Read them carefully to see if you could be a good fit with this organization.
