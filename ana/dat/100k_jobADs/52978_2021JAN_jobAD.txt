 hi! 4 year college grad po ako then, meron akong caregiver certificate, nakapag-registered online na ako pero i checked out the status of my registration nakalagay dun "status not activated" makikita po ba yun ng poea? kasi i think na-meet ko naman requirements nila. may chance ba na mapadalhan ako ng notice para sa 4th batch na caregiver for japan? salamat poâ€¦ more power to your good office.
