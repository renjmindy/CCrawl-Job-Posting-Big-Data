 Virtual Career Fairs FAQs

 What are virtual career fairs and how do they work? 
 Virtual career fairs, or virtual job fairs, is a  virtual event  that allows employers to connect with job seekers in a virtual environment, rather than in-person. 
 Job seekers can attend online job fairs from anywhere in the world, any time and on any device with access to the internet. Attendees sign up to the virtual recruitment event via a registration page, which takes them through to the event auditorium where they can attend the event. 
 Virtual career fairs are multi-session online events, so they often include virtual booths where they can speak to employers and sponsors, webinar presentations and webcasts. Attendees can interact with employers or recruiters using interactive features, such as live chat, Q&A, discussions, polls and more. However, most virtual career fairs are bespoke, so the amount of features and sessions run within them varies from event to event.

 What are the benefits of virtual career fairs? 
 If you’re wondering what the benefits of hosting a virtual career fair versus a physical job fair, then the primary advantage would be increased attendance. On average,  virtual career fairs attract 7x more attendees  due to the unlimited capacity and round-the-clock convenience. Attendees are not restricted by geographical location, so they attend from wherever they are in the world on any device. 
 Meanwhile, jobs receive  36% more applications when paired with video content  , so companies can attract more job applicants in a virtual environment with video than they would in-person. They will also encourage more direct interactions between job seekers and employers, as  30% of people are more likely to speak to a person in a virtual booth  and  47% of people are more likely to ask a question virtually than in-person  - as it is less intimidating interacting with a virtual avatar - and interactive features, like live chat and Q&A make two-way communication easier in a crowded environment.
