  Online Job Search Isn't Working, Should I Go Offline?  
 Work It Daily 
 August 05, 2009 
 Dear Experts, I have recently hit a roadblock in my job search. I've been using the internet to job search and network, but most of my efforts have lead to dead ends thus far. Should I take my job search offline by going to the companies I want to work for and drop off my resume? If it is recommended, how do I network while there?  Here is how our T.A.P. experts answered this question:   Q#234  You need to explore all options when searching. send out R&C, drop off, join industry assn. leverage ur contacts. ( @DebraWheatman )  Q#234  on-line best when complementd w/off-line netwking, face2face mtgs, referals. Pple hire pple, not bytes ( @juliaerickson )  Q#234  Take it off-line. Pick up phone & ask for networking meetings! Info Interviews get jobs in this economy! ( @jtodonnell )  Q#234  Try setting up an informational interview. Be sure to ask questions and show interest. Don't leave w/o a business card. ( @gradversity )  Q#234  Have you tried offline networking events Check with your professional assn, alumni assn, etc. ( @heatherhuhman )  Our Twitter Advice Project (T.A.P.) is no longer an active campaign.
