 Procrastination 
 People have a habit of problem solving my issues by trying to talk me out of needing the very thing I know I need. Anything to get out of having to help me do the actual thing. 
 We’ve all worked with those people who if they just did their damn job. 
 Wishing everyone a very Happy New Year… May 2019 be all you can dream of…
