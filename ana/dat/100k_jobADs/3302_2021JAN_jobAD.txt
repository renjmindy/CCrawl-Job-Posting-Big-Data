 8 Best Work From Home Jobs for Retired People 
 1. Online Tutor 
 If you are a  retired teacher  or you have  technical knowledge  in a specific field, this is exactly for you. You can teach what you know your entire life to someone who is new to your field. 
 You can learn about how to teach so that you can prepare material for teaching and start to make money at home. There are many things that people want to learn online such as Math, Languages, Science, History, Programming, Cooking, you name it. 
 You never know about what people would want to learn, all you have to do is research about a company that provides online tutoring platform and look for anything that you can teach. 
 Some platforms are listed  here  that you can apply to be an online tutor but please  be aware  that there are a lot of  scams  online. Please do not give any money out to get selected as a tutor, a legit company won't ask for any money from you to work for them. 
 2. Paid Survey 
 Doing paid survey is a way to make extra money for those who don't that extra money to sustain their life. It is just a way to kill time by completing some surveys and you get paid for completing the surveys. 
 Please note that the income from doing the paid survey is not high at all, you might make $1000 per month if you are really hardworking. 
 Below are some companies that offer paid survey. Please be aware that I am not associated with any of these firms.

 Fusion Cash  (   Sign Up Here-USA & Canada Only ) 
 Pinecone Research  (   Sign Up Here-USA Only ) 
 
 3. Freelance Writer 
 Freelancing writers is another popular  work-at-home job . The job title is pretty self-explanatory but for those who don't know, it is a job that gets you paid by  writing  articles, blog, eBook, etc. 
 Similar to virtual assistants, there are people who own big blogs or websites but don't like writing. These people usually hire people to write for them so that they can save time to do something else. 
 Don't worry if you don't know what to write because the blog owner would not want you to ruin their blog as well. They will prepare material for you and teach you about his/her writing style so that you can mimic and write for them. 
 Writers generally get paid pretty good if they produce quality work. There are a ton of resources to learn about content writing if you google about it. One of them that I am familiar with is  Wealthy Affiliate  because it is what I used to learn about writing. 
 Freelancer.com or Upwork are some other great platforms other than Fiverr that you can search for freelance jobs. **

 4. Driver 
 Sign up to be a Uber/Lyft/Amazon driver is another great way to meet new people, kill time and make money. You get to see all kind of people and time passes really fast by driving around the city. 
 The best part is the average income of a Uber driver is actually quite high. According to www.ridester.com, you will make $8.50 - $11 per hour by driving Uber. 
 You work at your leisure, if you don't feel good at any time, you can just head home. That's why it is extremely suitable for retired people, you work whenever you feel like. 
 5. Transcriber 
 Transcriptionists usually get paid $7-$21 working for companies like ** TranscribeMe , **** 3Play Media  **and  Net Transcripts . Being a transcriptionist lets you make money by listening to audio files and turn them into words. 
 There are courses online to teach you how to become a transcriptionist because you need to have a good reputation to get clients or to get a job in the company mentioned earlier. 
 If you are willing to listen to audio files and pay attention to it, you can earn extra money by transcribing while staying at home. 
 6. Tax Preparer 
 You donâ€™t need to be an accountant to prepare taxes. A tax preparer is another good short-term job you could do on an annual basis. There are more than 12,000 offices in the US which hire seasonal tax preparers. 
 You don't have to worry about don't know how to prepare tax because some companies offer a tax preparation course for a fee and you can attend those classes to get the skills. 
 After learning the skills, you will not only work for those companies, you can also help your family and friends(for a fee of course) to prepare their taxes. 
 **7. Bookkeeper 
 ** 
 Bookkeepers essentially record financial transactions, review and update financial statements. It can be done either as a freelancer or for a company remotely. 
 According to Glassdoor, virtual bookkeeper generally gets paid $15-$20 per hour in an accounting company. This job is for those who have an accounting background. 
 You can certainly learn the skill online but it will require some upfront cost to buy online courses or to learn from someone who has more experience. 
 8. Affiliate Marketer 
 Being an affiliate marketer can make you a lot of money if you are serious about it. Unlike freelancing, there is  no limit on how much you can make  because it is essentially  passive income . 
 Affiliate Marketing is a business model that pays you in the form of commission for promoting somebody else's product. For example, you recommend your friend to buy a TV from BestBuy. 
 Your friend spends $800 to buy it and you have an affiliate connection with BestBuy where you will get 10% for each sale. Then you are making $80 from recommending your friend to buy that TV. 
 Imagine you have a website that talks about how good the TV is and there are 1000 people looking at your website and 10 decided to buy the TV. Then you will make $800 from just these 10 people. 
 Therefore, you can imagine the  power of affiliate marketing . The key to succeeding in affiliate marketing is  how to get many people to your website  and  how to write good content so that they will buy .

 How To Do Affiliate Marketing? 
 Starting an affiliate marketing business is not easy but you can potentially make  4-6 figures a month . It is definitely worth a shot if you are serious about  making money online . 
 1. Pick a Niche 
 Firstly, you need to select a niche which is something that you are passionate about. This is really important because this is what your business will base on. Make sure you pick something you like so that you will enjoy creating content around it. 
 ' How to find a profitable niche'  is actually something really important I have learned from  Wealthy Affiliate . If you pick the right niche, you will see result way sooner because there is a big potential to make money in the market. 
 Therefore, I recommend spending a decent amount of time to look for a profitable niche. The general guideline is to pick something that many people are interested in and will go look for more information about it. That's when they will reach your website and probably buy something off your website. 
 2. Create a Website 
 After selecting a niche, you need to create a website to blog about the niche.  Don 't be overwhelmed  by creating a website. It is very easy to create a website with technology nowadays. 
 All you have to do is follow our previous post '   how to start a blog under 4 easy steps '. It is so easy that even my grandma can create a website by following the guide. 
 If you really need help to set up a website, please reach out to our team at ray222yo@gmail.com, we will be happy to help. 
 3. Find High Paying Affiliate Programs 
 Before writing your very first blog, you need to look for high paying affiliate programs because you can maximize your income by working with a high paying program. 
 Unlike Amazon which pays their affiliate around 10-15%, there are affiliate programs like  Wealthy Affiliate  that pays as high as 50%. 
 Please spend the time to look for a high paying program because you don't want your effort going into waste. Make sure you get the most commission for every sale you make. 
 4. Content Writing 
 After setting up your website and found a high paying affiliate program, you can then start creating your content. 
 Content writing  is the key part of the entire process because it will determine if your website will rank high on Google so that your website will have  organic traffic  where people come to you automatically. 
 Google's algorithm is smart because it will only rank a page that provides  high-quality content  to its viewers. 
 Therefore, I have learned about how to create good quality content so that Google ranks me high. There are tricks like  setting up a sitemap  ,  meta tags  ,  keyword researching  and others that I found really helpful to get me rank high. 
 Wealthy Affiliate  teaches me how to do all these and I am really glad that the tutorials are so  easy to follow  and to understand. Now my website gets FREE organic traffic from Google daily and is making money for me while I am spending with family. 
 5. Drive Traffic and Make Money 
 The last step is to make sure your website gets a lot of traffics because you can also make money from placing ads on the website even you have made no sale. 
 Companies like Mediavine and Google Adsense pay you if your website has a lot of visitors and they view/click on the ads. 
 Therefore, I think it's really a good investment to have a blog because there are so many ways you can make money from it. It is no harm to create a free account on  Wealthy Affiliate  , no credit card information is needed. You lose Nothing and you get to create 2 websites by paying $0. 
 Try it out and if you don't like it, you can always ignore it and try other ways of making money at home. Please make sure you take action in trying something out because you will never make money by doing nothing.
