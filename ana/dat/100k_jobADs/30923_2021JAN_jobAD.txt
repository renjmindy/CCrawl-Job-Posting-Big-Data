 There are no dead end jobs,just dead end people:It is an adventure to be alive 
 March 24, 2018November 21, 2020  /  antoinettesydneyblog  /  Leave a comment 
 Today is a present. Are you alive or just living ? Bills ,bills ,bills. I wish the person who invented bills will choke on his saliva. Bills are a huge inconvenience to me. But working towards generating funds to pay these bills is fun. In the absence of he responsibility to pay bills,some people may never enter into the workforce. Nevertheless,it is a blessing to be on your way to work. Some people are not economically active. Look  at  it as a quest. You are on a journey to make money. Do not look at it as going to your dead end job. A wise man told me that there are "â€¦No dead end jobs,just dead end people ". Do not resent your employer,after all  the company is paying your bills,sending your kids to school. For the entrepreneurs out there,think of your job as your investor. I encourage you to view your day as an adventure,just like something I heard in the movie Peter Pan ,the version with Robin Williams.
