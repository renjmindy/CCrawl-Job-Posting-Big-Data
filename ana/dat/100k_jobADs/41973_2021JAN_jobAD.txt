 Do you ever hire people without disabilities? 
 We do hire in the competitive market. When that happens, the jobs are posted with media, hiring agencies, and on our website. 
 I know someone with a disability who may qualify for a job. Where can I send them, or who can they talk to? 
 The first place to send them is to the local  Texas Workforce Solutions - Vocational Rehabilitative Services  office. You can also contact  Work Services Corporation  who will be able to assist you in contacting the proper agencies. 
 What type of disability do I have to have to get a job? 
 Disabilities are not a requirement for a job; however, some of our contracts require a minimum 75% ratio of people with disabilities. WSC makes necessary decisions when selecting candidates for a job. Having said that, a qualifying disability can typically be anything that affects one of the major life functions.
