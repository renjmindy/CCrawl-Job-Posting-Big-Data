 “The best thing about workshop software is pretty much everything. 
 The integration with myob is amazing, the ease of payments and syncing makes life a million times easier. 
 The search bar at the top is a little bit of genius, it is just awesome. 
 The videos showing all the new updates and features are great and actually show you how to do it instead of just an email. 
 Overall workshop software is awesome.”
