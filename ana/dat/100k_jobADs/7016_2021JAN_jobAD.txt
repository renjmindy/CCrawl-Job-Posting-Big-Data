 I am interested in the product studio space. I am an idea person and am interested in the opportunities thrown up by a product studio. I think 2020 has also thrown up some interesting opportunities for potential products and businesses to start with. 
 I am looking for a co-conspirator, someone who loves ideas and the potential of building businesses. Some experience in the product space would be great but not compulsory. Enthusiasm and keen-ness to throw some ideas around and then get stuck in to build some stuff is the key I'm looking for! 
 If you are interested send an application through! No need for a C.V just a blurb about you and why you're keen to be involved. 
 Look forward to hearing from you!
