 Ria Paduata, 
 Only the recruiting agency can say if they have the capability to accept applicants who are in another country. So I suggest that you send them an Email inquiring the same. The recruiting agency's Email Address is  provident@hotmail.com . 
 Thanks for visiting Caregiver Work Abroad.
