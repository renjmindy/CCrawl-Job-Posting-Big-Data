  Are Career Experts Full of It?  
 Work It Daily 
 September 08, 2009 
 Dear Experts, I'm starting to think that all of you Career Experts are a bunch of liars. I've been out of work for 8 months. I've read tons of articles, tried all the advice given and I STILL am unemployed. Is this all a bunch of rubbish you are feeding people to get them to buy your stuff?  Here is how our T.A.P. experts answered this question:   Q#280  OK/nrml 2 feel bitter 4 a bit, yet 2 much hurts srch; keep active; lv no stone unturned; find buddy. [2/2] ( @juliaerickson )  Q#280  Recession sucks; I feel frustrated 4 u & my clients. Some try consulting, PT wk while srching 4 FT... [1/2] ( @juliaerickson )  Q#280  Funny. We usually make money from people who actually GET jobs, b/c they listen to our advice. ( @beneubanks )  Q#280  Nice ... My guess, negatively exudes during interviews too. No one hires Negative Nelly or Grumpy Gus. ( @dawnbugni )  Q#280  Turning your hostility on people trying to help you, rather than realizing we're in a recession, doesn't bode well. ( @AskAManager )  Q#280  Come on. Most of us spend our time giving job advice for free. But we're not magicians. & bitterness isn't helping. ( @AskAManager )  Q#280  Frustrating. Unfortunately, reading advice is not always the golden ticket. HOW you implement is key. ( @keppie_careers )  Q#280  Busted! Nothing for sale here but snake oil. Guess I'll have to go back to stealing lunch money from school children. ( @gradversity )  Q#280  Also, provide room for the fact that career advice isn't always "one size fits all." ( @teenarose )  Q#280  Have you followed all experts? We all shouldn't be thrown into same pickle barrel. I feel your pain though. ( @teenarose )  Q#280  MANY sincere/savvy career exp. chock full of client wins. Persist, despite being knocked down. No silver bullet. ( @ValueIntoWords )  Our Twitter Advice Project (T.A.P.) is no longer an active campaign.
