 I got a dreamjob <3 
 May 10, 2019  |  Kikko Henriksen 
 Sometimes you are in the right place at the right time. And after a lot of uncertainties we finally got acceptance that I could start as project leader at the Children's Hospital of Copenhagen. I'm going to run a project called "Break the isolation" for kids and adolescences living with cancer. It will helping them through VR/AR experiences to socially connect with friends and family at home - and others in the same situation at the hospital. Aaaand also have fun and encourage more movement. 
 I just had my 3th day today and I'm so excited!
