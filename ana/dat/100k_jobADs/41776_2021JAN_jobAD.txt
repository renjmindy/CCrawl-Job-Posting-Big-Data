 About Prenda 
 Prenda makes it easy to open a K-8 microschool in your home, studio or office. We start with an adult guide who cares about kids and believes in the power of learning. We provide everything the guide needs to run a microschool - training, support, software, curriculum, and funding so they get paid. 
 About the role 
 Prenda is on a mission to empower learners. We help people run microschools, where small groups of kids meet in a home and own their education. The model is helping light a fire for kids like Mo ( https://youtu.be/g4nLjauGM3U ), and we want to empower many more. Imagine a world where kids grow up as empowered learners - they choose to learn, develop their gifts, and apply their passion and grit to solve the world’s big problems! 
 We are looking for a team lead for the Outreach team. This team focuses on telling the Prenda story far and wide. The leader of the Outreach team will be completely immersed in the vision of how to find and educate great parents, potential guides, and students. They will serve other teams in the company with quality leads. They will work with the team to build growth channels to effectively find thousands of interested parents and guides, and will measure their success by evaluating the number of quality leads in our system. 
 A little about our culture: we believe in servant leadership, so if you are wanting the job to feel awesome about yourself, it might not be a great fit. Our company is obsessed with the mission of empowering learners, we live our core values ( https://prendaschool.com/mission ) and we combine that with small, autonomous teams that run experiments and make decisions based on data. 
 Before agreeing to a full-time role, Prenda hires everyone for a "gig.” This is a flexible, short-term project where we learn about you and you learn about us, and we’ll pay you for it.
