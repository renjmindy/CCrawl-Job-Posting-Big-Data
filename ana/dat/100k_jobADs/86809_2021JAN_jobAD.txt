 Grofar selected for BETT Futures 
 October 24, 2016   grofarwebsite 
 At Grofar, we are honoured to be selected for  BETT Futures , the ‘home for the world’s most inspiring edtech startups’. Grofar fulfils a long term ambition to help improve the careers service in schools and raise student aspirations. Grofar was founded by members of the trusted, award-winning team that created  Schoolcomms . 
 Extensive research performed by Grofar identified how important (and often undervalued) the careers service is within schools and how tough a careers leader’s role can be. 
 The Careers Guidance Management Solution, was born to save Careers Leaders time by significantly reducing administrative burden. Grofar is an all-in-one software solution that manages all the complicated processes performed by school careers services. To this end, Grofar has been a ‘game-changer’ in pioneering a new solution to evidence CEIAG and improve student outcomes. 
 Over the course of the BETT show we will demonstrate how to use Grofar to meet  Statutory Guidance , satisfy  Ofsted  and achieve the  Gatsby Benchmarks . 
 Grofar are excited also to be launching our new Employer Engagement platform at BETT. "Employers can offer a wide range of valuable services and resources to schools. Employers want to offer these services and support their communities but lack an easy means. We have created a simple solution to empower both schools and employers and provide full circle engagement", explains managing director James Robertson.

 Careers Silver Bullet? 
 June 7, 2016   grofarwebsite 
 In Sir John Holman's 2014, Gatsby report he said that there was no “silver bullet” that would of itself transform the quality of careers advice in schools. Instead, he said schools needed to provide a series of measures to a high standard. 
 His views are based on extensive research in the UK, Canada Germany, Holland, Finland, Ireland and Hong Kong. The English government has welcomed the eight Gatsby Benchmarks believing that they provide an important framework of activities and philosophy of what good CEIAG looks like. 
 The Benchmarks cover all aspects of CEIAG, from achieving a stable careers programme and making this known and understood by students, parents, teachers, governors and employers to providing personal career guidance, best provided by a qualified and registered career adviser. There are also benchmarks for learning from LMI, encounters with employers, FE, HE and other learning providers, work experience and linking curriculum learning to careers. 
 Career professionals will applaud the focus but for hard worked career coordinators and career leaders, the level of expectation, planning, management and organisational skills should not be under estimated. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was asked to calculate the cost of providing such services and estimated it would be £207 million in the first year and £173 million a year thereafter, or just under £45,000 per secondary school in England. Professional career guidance and management and admin skills of this breadth do not come cheaply. 
 At Grofar, we cannot of course offer a silver bullet but what we can do is help schools achieve many of the objectives set out in the Gatsby report, as the table below shows:
