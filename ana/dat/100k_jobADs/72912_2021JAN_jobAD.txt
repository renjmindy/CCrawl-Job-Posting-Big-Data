 What is Howbout?   üéà 
 Howbout is a social planning app that modernises the calendar and the way you organise your social & personal life. It helps you instantly find a date you're all free, easily organise any in-person or virtual event and quickly manage everything you've got going on. 
 Following a really exciting 1st year - where we were downloaded 30,000 times, were featured 3x by Apple, helped users in >100 countries organise more than 700 events a day and got backing from a senior Snapchat exec - we're looking to grow our team and take Howbout to the next level.
