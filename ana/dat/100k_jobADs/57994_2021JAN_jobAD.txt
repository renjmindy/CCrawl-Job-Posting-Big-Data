 Jesus Saves 
 Posted on  December 29, 2013  by  sherry386 
 The following is a witness to the miraculous power of Jesus Christ through faith and prayer. Mr. Yearwood's journey was shared with me by my good friend, Brenda. I share it now with you. 
 My Healing Journey Guided by the Hand of God 
 Peter 3:20 "The few people in the boat, eight in all, were saved by the water, which was a symbol pointing to baptism, which now saves you. It is not the washing off of bodily dirt, but the promise made to God from a good conscience. It saves you through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who has gone to heaven and is at the right side of God,  ruling   over all angels and heavenly authorities and powers ." 
 The angel told Mary, (Lk 1:37), "For there is  nothing that God cannot do ." 
 Job 42:2 " Job - I know Lord, that You are all-powerful; that  You can do everything You want . You ask how I dare question Your wisdom when I am so very ignorant. I talked about things I did not understand, about marvels too great for me to know. You told me to listen while You spoke and to try to answer Your questions, In the past I knew only what others had told me, but now I have seen You with my own eyes, So I am ashamed of all I have said and repent in dust and ashes…..The Lord blessed the last part of Job's life even more than He had blessed the first…And then he died at a very great age." 
 Amen. 
 C'est Bon, 
 Love, 
 Sherry
