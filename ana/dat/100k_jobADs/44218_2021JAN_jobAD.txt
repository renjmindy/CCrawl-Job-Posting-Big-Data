 Company Overview 
 Paramount Consulting Group 
 Paramount Consulting Group was started in April 2019 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We grew out of our partnering office in Columbia, Maryland. We have far exceeded our customers and client’s expectations, which is how we were able to start our office. We work day in and day out to provide the best service and support we can for all our customers. We pride ourselves on our family atmosphere which makes coming to work everyday feel a little less like work. We have a competitive growth structure which rewards employees based on shown effort and achievement, rather than time spent with the company.  Learn More
