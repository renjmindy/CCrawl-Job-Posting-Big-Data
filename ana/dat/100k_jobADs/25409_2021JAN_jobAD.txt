 It is my belief that Everywhere Wireless job ads on Indeed.com are some kind of scam. 
 Posted on  October 15, 2019  by  johnvkaravitis 
 I sent my resume in response to an ad they placed in Indeed.com. They could only see me Saturday afternoon, so I agreed to meet with them then. However, something came up, and I wanted to reschedule. They told me that they were close to making a decision, so they did not reschedule me for an interview. Well, I've been seeing THE SAME JOB ADS on Indeed.com for a month now, so I re-applied. I just got back the same generic computer-generated email from these scammers/assholes that I got the first time: 
 _Hi John, __ ___ 
 _____Your resume and background have really caught my attention! I’d like to learn about more about you; please take this series of quick tests as part of our next steps. It may approximately one hour to complete and, for the best results, do not use a smartphone or other mobile device. __ ___ 
 _____Once finished, the results are automatically forwarded to the hiring manager for final screening, before scheduling in-person interviews. Hope to hear from you soon! __ ___
