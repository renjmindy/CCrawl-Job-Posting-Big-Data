 Of course we all are looking for the best fit for the job, right? But how often do you think about their ability to handle your particular management style? This is often an area that managers overlook when asking the candidates questions during an interview. 
 Here are some questions that you should consider asking in your interviews to help assess the candidate’s adaptability to different management styles: 
 
 Describe the perfect manager. 
 Based on your past employment, who would you choose as the best manager you’ve had the opportunity to work for? Why were they good? 
 Based on your past employment, who would you choose as your least favorite manager? Why were they your least favorite? How did you adapt? 
 How do you handle conflict with your managers? Disagreements? How do you resolve issues? 
 
 By asking questions similar to the ones listed above, you’ll find a greater understanding of how the candidate feels about different management styles. If you find that you’re for the most part the ideal manager described by the candidate then you can have confidence that you’ll work great together should you decide to hire them for the position. On the other hand, if you really like the candidate but worry about being similar to the manager that was their least favorite then you can consider ways to adapt to ensure a smooth and successful relationship if you decide to hire them on. 
 You shouldn’t base your hiring decision on whether or not they can or cannot handle your management style but rather use these questions to help prepare yourself for building and maintaining successful relationships with new hires.

 #1: Use Common Sense 
 You’d be surprised by how many people don’t even use simple logic while applying to jobs. 
 
 It’s common logic that a .Net developer must not apply to content writing jobs 
 It’s common logic that if the job description says only graduates should apply, under graduates aren’t qualified 
 Again, it’s common logic that if you are instructed not to send in your resume as the employer end cannot receive attachments, you should do it 
 
 Yet, most people simply do not heed these. Why? 
 Candidates are impatient -They don’t spend time reading the job description in full. They randomly go to job sites apply to 50 or more companies at one stretch and then site back expecting calls to pour in. I have news for you. It isn’t going to work that way! 
 Take the time and effort to apply individually to the jobs that match your profile the best. Most importantly, use common sense while applying for the job. 
 
 Read the job description thoroughly . Only if you fit the description apply for the job 
 Customize the resume  with the employers industry and job role each time you apply for a job 
 Follow instructions carefully . Some recruiters ask candidates to send resumes with certain keywords in the subject line. This is done so that the recruiters know the candidate has read the job description fully. Even if you are fully qualified for the job, if you don’t include the keyword, your email will see the trash folder only! 
 
 #2: Make Use of Cover Letters 
 Most job applications posted on job portals might not explicitly specify that they need a cover letter. 
 However, recruiters expect you to send one in along with your resume. 
 A cover letter helps you set the stage. It convinces the employer that they should go through the resume and invite the candidate over for an interview over all the other candidates who applied (often in the hundreds or in the thousands range). 
 A well-crafted cover letter helps you display your professionalism and your real interest in working with the company. If you are not truly interested in a company, you are not going to spend time creating a cover letter; are you? 
 While your choice of using a covering letter maybe good, equal care must be taken that it shouldn’t be a copy paste version of the many templates you get online. These templates must only be used as reference, not copy pasted entirely and changes made here and there to suit your needs. 
 How to Make Employers Get Back to You? 
 Follow-Up 
 Most candidates think that applying to the job is all they need to do and the employers will schedule an interview with them. In an ideal world that should happen for qualified candidates. We, however, live in a non-ideal world where people have so very less time, and there are hundred things to be done. 
 Recruiters always look to lighten their load and they sometimes don’t get back to the candidates unless they follow up. This serves two purposes: 
 
 Their workload is severely reduced 
 Only interested and qualified candidates take time to follow-up. These are much better hiring leads to spend time on rather than the hundreds of “give-me-a-job” applicants
