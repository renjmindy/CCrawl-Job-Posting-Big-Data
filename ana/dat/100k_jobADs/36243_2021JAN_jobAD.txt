 Characters looking for job 
 Posted on  April 17, 2013  by  schizoart 
 So, I got a lot of characters but no scripts. 
 Feel like you have an idea on between 1 and 6 panels that you want to have done, then we could start a collaboration and make something funny. Your name is going to show in clear letters so people know that you're the writerâ€¦ money? Not yet. If we're able to make a webcomic that becomes a great success, then you're going to get your share as well! 
 What will it be about? Anything really. Interested? Let me know 
 I will post a few characters and stupid ideas eventually.
