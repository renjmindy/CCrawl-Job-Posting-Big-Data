 LET'S GET STARTED 
 Frequently Asked Questions 
 What type of organizations does WorkMonger work with? 
 __ 
 We work with all types of organizations in the broader education sector, including: school districts, public charter schools, community colleges, foundations, government agencies, support organizations, education technology companies, policy/advocacy organizations, and more. If an organization (or a team within an organization) is working to ensure children have access to an excellent education, either directly or indirectly, we work with them. Check out some of the Employers we have worked with here . 
 What is a “non-teaching job in education”? 
 __ 
 We focus on non-teaching jobs in the education sector, such as jobs in finance, operations, curriculum design, strategy, fundraising and development, program management, administration, policy, advocacy, principals and instructional coaches, human capital management, legal, information technology, facilities management, and more. Check out some of our JobSeeker success storieshere to see examples of roles we’ve filled. 
 What level of roles does WorkMonger match? 
 __ 
 We focus on professional non-teaching roles - from entry level to executive. Most of our roles fall somewhere in the middle. All of our roles require at least a high school diploma or equivalent, most require a college degree, and many require a graduate degree, too. 
 Does WorkMonger only match full-time roles? What about part-time or project-based work? 
 __ 
 Most of our jobs are traditional full-time roles. However, we also believe that the workforce and workplace are changing, giving way to an increasing number of professional part-time, short-term, or independent contractor project gigs. Therefore, we do our best to seek out those roles as well. Your JobSeeker Profile allows you to select which type of schedule and structure you are looking for, including an openness to full-time, part-time, and project work. 
 Do I have to have prior work experience in education? 
 __ 
 No! Definitely not. Many of our JobSeekers fall into one of two categories: (a) former educators looking to transition outside of the classroom or (b) non-education professionals looking to transition from the private sector into the education sector to make a greater impact with their careers. We also have many JobSeekers who are currently non-teaching professionals in education who are simply looking for their next role. Many of our Employers do seek candidates with teaching or education-related experience; however, many are also interested in hiring candidates with private sector experience. 
 Bottom line, no matter what your background is, if you’re interested in helping ensure every child has access to an excellent education, you should complete your JobSeeker profile today! 
 If you are trying to improve education, why does WorkMonger focus only on non-teaching jobs? 
 __ 
 Great question! At WorkMonger, we know that nothing within a school is more important than a high-quality teacher in front of each and every student. Standing behind every teacher are professionals running budgets, operations, human capital, data analysis, curriculum innovation, and policy. Education is a $1.5 trillion industry with complex managerial issues to address. We know from our team’s deep subject matter expertise that these support offices and organizations need innovative professionals to support great teachers from outside the classroom. That’s where we come in. 
 Why does WorkMonger only serve education? Will you be serving other causes in the future? 
 __ 
 We serve education primarily because (1) we are deeply passionate about ensuring every child has access to an excellent education and (2) we have extensive expertise and networks in the education sector. At this stage in our organization’s growth, we realize that we can’t be all things to all people with excellence. 
 By limiting our focus to a specific cause (education), we can greatly increase the quality of our matches. Our long-term vision has not changed however; in future years, we plan to add additional causes in the social impact sector that we can serve. Stay updated on WorkMonger’s growth - follow us on  Facebook ,  Twitter , or  LinkedIn . 
 Why can’t I search a list of current job openings? 
 __ 
 We don’t provide a list of our current job openings because we aren’t a job board. WorkMonger uses the data in your JobSeeker profile and the data in Employer and Job Profiles to match JobSeekers with roles utilizing our proprietary algorithm, which we are constantly refining to ensure the best matches. Then our team reviews the matches by hand. That means you don’t have to search job board after job board, city after city, hunting for your next role. You tell us about you, and we do the rest. 
 What geographic areas does WorkMonger serve? 
 __ 
 We are nation-wide with JobSeekers and Employers from all across the country. In your JobSeeker Profile, you can specify which geographic areas you are willing to work in, including indicating that you would move anywhere for the right role or that you are only seeking virtual work. As for the WorkMonger team itself, we’re based in Austin, Texas. 
 Does WorkMonger serve international organizations or JobSeekers? 
 __ 
 Currently, we only serve education organizations in the United States and those JobSeekers who have the proper authorization to work in the United States. We realize that there are children in need of an excellent education worldwide, and we hope to one day be able to expand globally to meet their needs as well. 
 Does WorkMonger guarantee that you’ll find me a job? 
 __ 
 Unfortunately, no. While we have a deep and constantly growing pool of Employers and Jobs, at any given time there are a finite number of jobs we are filling. If you do not receive a match, it is not an indication of how awesome you are as a candidate. If you are not a match for one of our existing roles, we will continue to evaluate you for matches as new roles are submitted to WorkMonger on a rolling basis. Therefore, WorkMonger should not be your only method for looking for a job. But it only takes about 20 minutes to complete our JobSeeker profile, and it is completely free. So, you have nothing to lose –  give us a try ! 
 Is it confidential? Will my employer know I am job searching? 
 __ 
 WorkMonger is 100% confidential. Just as JobSeekers cannot see open positions, Employers cannot see available JobSeekers. When we generate a match between a JobSeeker and an Employer, we always check with the JobSeeker first before sharing your information with Employers. We never share other personal information with anyone else for any reason. 
 Is it really free? What’s the catch? 
 __ 
 Yes, it’s really free - no catch! WorkMonger never charges to complete a JobSeeker profile and join our JobSeeker pool. Our Employers pay a fee when they successfully hire a WorkMonger JobSeeker, but JobSeekers pay nothing (in fact, we'll give you a $75 Visa gift card if you get hired!) 
 We do offer some Support Services (resume and cover letter review, interview prep, and career coaching) exclusively to our JobSeekers for an additional charge. These services are completely optional and not necessary to be matched with one of our Employers. 
 Can WorkMonger help me rewrite my resume or cover letter, prepare for an interview, or with general career coaching? 
 __ 
 Yes! WorkMonger offers additional Career Services, such as resume or cover letter review, LinkedIn strategy, interview preparation, and career coaching for a small fee. These services are completely optional and not necessary to be matched with one of our Employers. You can learn more and sign-up here: https://workmonger.com/career-services/ .

 Here’s what some of our past JobSeekers had to say about WorkMonger 
 Keina 
 New Role:  Business Operations Manager 
 Employer:  Rocketship Charter Schools 
 WorkMonger has been a huge asset in helping me through my job search. 
 They sent me several job matches, and I was offered two different positions using their services. I would definitely recommend Workmonger to anyone currently in the job market. They help expedite your application to hiring managers, and they help you land the job! 
 Jessica 
 New Role:  Research Consultant 
 Employer:  Raise Your Hand Texas 
 WorkMonger made my job search experience efficient and personal. 
 Navigating the multitude of jobs that are posted online can take a ton of time, with no guarantee of results. WorkMonger was able to quickly match and connect me with an organization that was a great fit for my skills and future career aspirations. Throughout the entire process, WorkMonger staff were informative, accessible, and supportive, which made for a positive experience. 
 Scott 
 New Role:  Chief Programs Officer 
 Employer:  Darden/Curry Partnership for Leaders in Education 
 From the very first contact I had from WorkMonger (a simple note letting me know that they had an exciting opportunity for me to consider) until I was offered the role, the WorkMonger team took incredibly good care of me. 
 They were always available for a quick phone call to discuss the process, to offer a word of advice as I prepared for an interview, or to help me consider whether or not to pursue the opportunity. The role is an absolutely perfect fit, and it would not have been on my radar if they hadn't reached out. In short: I am thrilled about my next step, certain that WorkMonger played an instrumental role in helping me find it, and deeply grateful for their intentional effort to make the job seeking process easy and enjoyable. 
 Jake 
 New Role:  Director of Talent Recruitment 
 Employer:  Opportunity 180 
 I found the entire process with WorkMonger to be incredibly helpful and easy to navigate. 
 Job searching can be an incredibly daunting task, and even bigger challenge when you trying to do the search while maintaining your commitment to your current role. The team sent opportunities my way they felt were a good match for my skills and experience, and I had the opportunity to explore each role before making the ultimate decision of whether or not I wanted to apply. Because of WorkMonger, I was connected to a role in a city that I was not even exploring, but ended up being the perfect match for where I was in my career and the next step I wanted to take.

Families and children in Boyle Heights, South Los Angeles, and Watts are very talented and I look forward to collaborating with all of them.

Because of WorkMonger, I was connected to a role in a city that I was not even exploring, but ended up being the perfect match for where I was in my career and the next step I wanted to take. 
 Jessica 
 New Role:  Research Consultant 
 Employer:  Raise Your Hand Texas 
 WorkMonger made my job search experience efficient and personal. 
 Navigating the multitude of jobs that are posted online can take a ton of time, with no guarantee of results. WorkMonger was able to quickly match and connect me with an organization that was a great fit for my skills and future career aspirations. Throughout the entire process, WorkMonger staff were informative, accessible, and supportive, which made for a positive experience. 
 Bertrand 
 New Role:  Family and Community Engagement Manager 
 Employer:  Partnership for LA Schools 
 WorkMonger did an exceptional job at evaluating my work experience and matching it with my current position. 
 Not only did they expose me to this position, but they followed up during every step of the application process. Their efforts enabled me to return to my hometown of South Los Angeles, change the trajectory of my family, and pursue my passion in public service. Families and children in Boyle Heights, South Los Angeles, and Watts are very talented and I look forward to collaborating with all of them. 
 Erin 
 New Role:  Consultant 
 Employer:  WiseWire 
 As a new mom, I was looking for work that would allow me to have a flexible schedule. WorkMonger has helped me to find this flexibility. 
 From beginning to end, my experience with WorkMonger was a delight. The website is clear and easy to navigate, and the initial survey asks all the right questions to help match each candidate to the perfect role. Job descriptions were shared with me within just a few days of completing a profile, and the WorkMonger staff were incredibly responsive and supportive throughout the “matching” process. I would highly recommend this service to anyone looking to find purposeful work that fits your schedule and lifestyle.

 New Role:  Director of Accountability 
 Employer:  Neighborhood Centers 
 WorkMonger helped me find the job of my dreams! 
 They were so helpful and really took time to assess my strengths and experiences and match me perfectly with my school district. They were also great at communicating with me as well as my employer. I cannot say enough good things about this experience from the ease of use to being hired for the job. WorkMonger is without a doubt the best job placement site for school leaders. 
 Chazz 
 New Role:  Senior Manager 
 Employer:  Empower Schools 
 WorkMonger made my job search a breeze. The advantage of moving straight to the interview stage saved time when I really needed it! I really appreciated the frequent communication, but what was especially remarkable to me was genuine enthusiasm and concern for matching me with the best opportunity for the next stage of my career.
