 Sr. dev working on building data pipelines for our microservice based SaaS platform 
 Role overview 
 Job Description 
 We are looking for someone that is adept at writing and delivering quality software. You will be working closely with the full team of eight full time engineers and the VP of Software Development. Our back-end stack is functional - Scala & Haskell (we have begun the process of migrating our Haskell back-end to Scala), they are used to create services that run in AWS. Typically our APIs are built with Finagle and Circe, and we haven't really landed on a preferred data access library, we've used Anorm, Scalike JDBC and Quill. We try not to be dogmatic about our tooling and we juggle that with the benefits of consistency. The customer UI is a single page web-app written in TypeScript/Angular. On the infrastructure side we currently use PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch, Kafka, and DataDog. 
 We are looking for someone that can help us architect and implement the data flow in our microservice SaaS platform. In this role you will be establishing the data engineering practice, and will be expected to define and promote best practices for big data development at Signal Vine. Further, you should have experience with a wide array of durable storage technologies and approaches - we are looking for someone that can understand our business goals and work with the team to design the appropriate way to collect & disseminate data across our platform to achieve them.
