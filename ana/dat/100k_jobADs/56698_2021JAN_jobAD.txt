 Is there a specific phrasing or word choice of which you are unsure, Vickyhere?

 Thank you Cathy Rose... 
 The correction are often most useful than the answers... thank you indeed! 
 And, what you thing about the word "support" instead of "perform"? And which the proper one? Maybe both of all them?

 I wouldn't use the word support because it doesn't say that you can actually do the job. It implies that the best you can do is support the person who IS doing the job!

 Great explanation, thank you! 
 Now, my phrase will be "I can perform easily all the roles and responsabilities mentioned in the job description and..." and I will put the rest of the sentence in a new thread, because is not allowed put entire sentences in one thread. 
 Thank you
