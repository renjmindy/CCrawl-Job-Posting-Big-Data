 Posted by  admin  on February 23, 2019 | Featured 
 The more you look around, the more people seem to be working from home, co-working spaces and abroad. Is this the new normal? It seems so. People are starting the value their lifestyle more than climbing the corporate ladder and are seeking out job opportunities that afford flexibility and freedom. 
 We identify the skills required to become a remote worker in 2019, how to get a remote job and how remote working will affect your lifestyle once you have secured it.

 Where to get a remote job? 
 Companies are starting to realize the benefits of hiring remote workers. Not only does it cut costs in terms of resources but it is less of a commitment and requires less admin. Startups are a huge advocate for remote working as they require specialized skills for short periods and often donâ€™t have funding for office space to accommodate staff. 
 Here are the top sites to source a remote working job: 
 
 Flexjobs 
 Upwork  
 We Work Remotely  
 Dribble jobs 
 Working nomads 
 Jobspresso 
 
 What does it mean to work remotely? 
 Deciding to become a remote worker means adopting a lifestyle change. Not being in an office environment means you will need to maintain discipline and get your work done but at the same time, you will have the choice on when and where to work. If you need structure to stay focused and remain productive, remote working may not be for you. However, if you are an independent person who can control and manage their workflow, the rewards are very evident. 
 Not only can you set your own hours, but you can work from any location, whether it be at home, a co-working space in the city or on an island - you have the freedom to decide. This can offer unique benefits in balancing your lifestyle and allow you to make time for things that are important to you, such as your health, family, or never-ending desire to travel. 
 All in all, we believe that you can have the perfect work/life balance and that society is making it easier every day to achieve this by embracing remote work.
