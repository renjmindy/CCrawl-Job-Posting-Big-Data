 About Respira: 
 Our vision is to build the most accessible and effective AI speech therapy that has the potential to transform the lives of 10% of the population, who suffer from speech impediments. 
 Most people with speech impediments have distressing symptoms that deeply affect their social and professional interactions, and there is no viable technological solution to solve this problem. For this reason, we created BeneTalk (www.benetalk.com). 
 BeneTalk is developing a gamified speech therapy mobile app (think 'Duolingo for speech') that will be able to track users' progress (think 'Fitbit for speech'). 
 Respira Ltd is the company behind Benetalk and is lucky to have the support from InnovateUK, Microsoft for Start-ups, Social Tech Trust, EIT health Headstart Accelerator, KQ Labs accelerator, Microsoft AI for Good Program, the University of Reading, the British Stammering Association, and the Stammer Trust. 
 What we are looking for: 
 We are looking for a passionate stammering specialist working in the NHS. The position is part-time, and we are keen for you to combine this work with NHS responsibilities. We believe that day-to-day knowledge and practice in this context is essential to our mission to help people who stammer and the therapists who work with them. You will help to improve our therapy content and work in collaboration with our product development team. We want to ensure that our technology addresses key challenges within stammering therapy. Your NHS experience will be vital in this sense, as we envisage our technology helping to address the lack of NHS support for people who stammer in many areas of the UK. You will have the ability to identify creative solutions to established issues within stammering therapy. Applications from speech-therapists who stammer are encouraged. 
 Hard Requirements: 
 
 Bachelor's degree in speech-language therapy 
 3+ years working in the NHS with people who stammer 
 Knowledge of behavioural and cognitive approaches to treating stammering 
 
 Desirables: 
 
 Currently working for the NHS 
 Experience in being involved with R&D projects and grants applications, especially the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) 
 
 Responsibilities: 
 
 Help to navigate the NHS and US markets 
 Advise and collaborate with the product development and research team to help to create and refine digital solutions for people who stammer 
 Test and give feedback on the initial prototypes and software tools. 
 Join weekly calls with other team members to discuss the project direction and status 
 Enjoy sharing knowledge, learning, and creative problem solving 
 
 About the position: 
 
 Opportunity to work collaboratively with a dynamic interdisciplinary team 
 Flexible working hours and location 
 Play a leading role in improving support for people who stammer
