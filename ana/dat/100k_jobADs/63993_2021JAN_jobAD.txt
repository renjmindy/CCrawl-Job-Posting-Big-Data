 Steve Jobs biography review/"best of" 
 I admire  Steve Jobs  and have bought many Apple products over the years but  I am not an Apple "fan boy"  **** as I removed  Apple  from my list of  admired companies  last year. 
 
 But I still eagerly picked up a copy of  Steve Jobs  (biography)  yesterday so that I can learn from it. I think  Steve Jobs  is an important book that it should be made required reading for all serious and self-respecting competitors of Apple. There are many good insights that entrepreneurs and business executives can learn from Apple and  Jobs . It will be foolish to think we can replicate and copy  Jobs  but it will be stupid to not to try to understand, to learn, and may be to be inspired. 
 In this post, I'm doing a  review/ "best of"   Steve Jobs  similar to my extensive  review/"best of" The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life) . I will start the  review/ "best of"  with the chapters that intrigue me the most. 
 
 Here is  my personal " _  best of _ " in the introduction chapter (click to read the high res capture) . I will include links to other chapter's entries (some with video clips, etc) to this post later. 
 Here is an excerpt from the  introduction chapter  (emphasis added), 
 
 'She [Laurene Powell, Steve Jobs' wife] is one of the smartest and most grounded people I have ever met. 'There are parts of his life and personality that are extremely messy, and that's the truth," she told me early on.  " You shouldn't whitewash it. He's good at spin, but he also has a remarkable story, and I'd like to see that it's all told truthfully." ' 
 
 
 Now, let me address the question that how come this book came out so quickly after  Jobs  ' death, is it an opportunistic and poorly researched "quicky bio"? 
 Well, actually in summer of 2004 when Steve Jobs knew he was sick (but almost no one knew yet), he tried but failed to convince author  Walter Isaacson  to write a biography of him as  Isaacson  said it was too early, " _  Maybe in a decade or two, when you retire. _ " 
 Quoting  Isaacson  from the introduction chapter of  the book , 
 
 "But in 2009 his wife, Laurene Powell, said bluntly,  " If you're ever going to do a book on Steve, you'd better do it now." He had just taken a second medical leave.  I confessed to her that when he had first raised the idea, I hadn't known he was sick. Almost nobody knew, she sid. He had called me right before he was going to be operated on for cancer, and he was still keeping it a secret, she explained."
