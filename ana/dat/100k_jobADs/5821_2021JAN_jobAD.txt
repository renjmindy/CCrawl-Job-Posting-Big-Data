About Varengold Bank AG 
 Varengold Bank AG is a German bank that was founded in 1995. We have offices in London and Sofia, but are at home in Hamburg, which is not only Germany’s 2nd largest city, but also one of the most livable places in the world. Our core business areas are Marketplace Banking and Commercial Banking. 
 Especially in Marketplace Banking, we see tremendous growth potential, because too many people and companies still have no access to capital or even banking services. We consider it our fundamental job as a bank to help change that. And we believe that the best way to do so is by supporting peer-to-peer (P2P) credit platforms in growing their businesses. These FinTechs can provide funds more efficiently, more effectively and on a much greater scale than we could directly. 
 Join us and help us become THE bank for the marketplace lending industry and a preferred partner of FinTechs by being fast, technology-driven and solution-oriented.
