 I received the email below yesterday. In red, I've added comments about why this offer is a scam and tips to help you avoid email work-at-home scams. 
 First of all, the odds of a legitimate job showing up out-of-the-blue in your email is nil. Employers are not hunting down potential employees. Always remember that legitimate work-at-home jobs are obtained the same way traditional jobs are. You find an announcement and you apply with a stellar application or resume. 
 Scam Email: 
 Attention,  (Anyone with a job offer will address it specifically to you by name) 
 We are currently seeking to employ an individual your area for a job opening in our company, it’s a work from home/office position and you are not required to pay any registration fee or pay for any application form before you get employed. 
 _Job details: All You need to do is received payment from our customers, process it and gets 10% on each payment being processed and you will be making at least close to $1,800 weekly. 
_(The red flag here is "received payment from our customers, processes it and gets 10% on each payment". First of all the grammar is bad, but the real flag is that payment processing involves fake check scams, which can cost you thousands of dollars, loss of banking privileges and possibly jail time. Common sense tells us that companies don't need help processing payments. Not with credit cards and PayPal and such.) 
 APPLICATION FORM 
 Full Name: 
 Address: (No P O Box) 
 City: 
 State: 
 Zip code: 
 Cellphone: 
 Other phone: 
 Gender: 
 Age: 
 Email Address: 
 Have you received or done an offer like this? Yes or No: If yes give an out come?  (I'm not sure what this guy is seeking except maybe people who've already lost money, to avoid them or dupe them again). 
 Send your resume to email. :  (email removed for your safety) for more details about the job. 
 If interested, get back with the information above. Upon receiving of these details I will also furnish you more in regards to the job. 
 Regards, 
 Martin Marcus. 
 Remember, payment processing is a scam by which you are sent a check, told to cash it, keep 10% and send the rest to the "employer" usually located in a foreign country. The bank will likely take the check, but then not long after, you'll get a notice from your bank saying the check was bad and you have to cover the loss. And it's possible the bank will call the police and you'll be arrested for cashing a fake check. Don't fall for this scam!
