 Work From Home Jobs Australia: 52 Jobs You Can Do From Home 
 by  Joshua 
 I've created the ultimate list of Australian work from home jobs. You could be a stay at home mum or just someone who needs extra income. This list is for you. 
 Online jobs are awesome in my opinion. I'm Joshua from the Gold Coast. For the last few years, I've been working from home in Australia…or sometimes cheekily in the sunshine. 😅 
 Silly Instagram photo aside, the internet literally changed my life. Today I earn 100% of my income online. In fact, my car is seldom used. 
 Welcome to the life of a digital nomad. 😃 You can work from home or literally anywhere. 
 Here's an epic list of 52+ online jobs in Australia where you can work from home. They're best if you're legitimately committed to working online. 
 Australian Jobs where you can work from home 
 I've created this list because when I was younger, no one else was willing to help. The online guides you'd read would say nonsense like "babysitting" or "dog grooming". 🙄 While you can make money with those things, those aren't really proper jobs with salaries and benefits. 
 In fact, the article on training.com.au lists Childcare Worker at #4. What the? You can't exactly do that while working from home…can you? Unless you're the business owner who runs a family daycare. 
 If you're reading this list, it means you're looking for a computer-based work from home job, right? Like something where you can work off the laptop. 🙏 
 A type of flexible job. It doesn't matter where or when. Like sometimes employers might have certain stipulations on working hours, like any job, but they're often not fixed. 
 What you're looking for is something that works. A part-time or full-time role. 
 All you're looking for is the real deal. A genuine list of ideas for which you can do. 
 More importantly,  how . Like how do you get these online jobs to work from home? 
 So not only will I create this list, but I'll show you how to get hired for one of these. 
 Let's begin. 
 How to start working from home 
 Working from home is an exciting gig, but one that takes some discipline. 
 Sure…no more commuting and often you can set your own working hours. 
 But you need to stay pretty committed to isolation. It's just…different. 
 The first step to get a legitimate online job in Australia is often the job boards. 
 Like Seek, Gumtree and Jora. I've found these to be both hit and miss. 
 The thing is: Most jobs won't be advertised as those working from home. 
 So you should use this list below as jobs that are often actually done from home. 
 I mean: You might have to negotiate the different working environment. 
 So you can work for a company for a couple of months then ask for a flexible arrangement. 
 While some companies would be welcoming when stating your intentions up front. 
 But otherwise, you'll be set with any of the job roles that I've listed below. 
 Best working from home jobs 
 This is the epic list. I created this for others here in Australia: 
 1. Content creator 
 I've put this #1 because this is exactly what I do. 😃 I create some epic content for clients not just in Australia, but around the world…all from home. I'm very passionate about creating content in the form of blogs and reports…in fact anything I can. The best part is that I even run my own business from home where I continue to build content each and every day, plus sell on Amazon. 
 Education required: High school certificate 
 Average hourly rate: $32 per hour (But I often earn more) 
 Pros: We're in the information age so content is essential for business owners. 
 Cons: You need to develop the skills for writing persuasive copy, which takes time. 
 2. Virtual assistant 
 People often say that all the best virtual assistant jobs are based in the Philippines, not Australia. Truth be told that this is one of the very best ways to make money by working from home today. Australian employers often prefer the talent of a locally-based workforce, even if it's just one employee. You'll be doing things like phone calls, writing newsletters, booking appointments, filing paperwork, data entry. 
 Education required: High school certificate 
 Average hourly rate: $24 full-time permanent 
 Pros: Every business needs a person on the phone. 
 Cons: Can be boring. You'll be multitasking a lot. 
 3. Company sales representative 
 Most businesses have or need a salesperson. It generates momentum in the business. You'll need to be knowledgeable about the product or service offering, paired with excellent verbal and written communication. While often done over the phone, you may actually be required at times to visit customer premises for presentations or to sign paperwork. 
 Education required: High school certificate 
 Average hourly rate: Often commission based, but sometimes in the $29/hour range. 
 Pros: It's the life-blood of most businesses to help them grow, so your job is secure. 
 Cons: High pressure to perform. You'll have to deal with lots of rejections. 
 4. Ecommerce store manager 
 The beauty of the internet is that you can order products online from just about anywhere these days. The problem is also…someone still needs to run the store. Often these online store owners are so busy growing their business (like me!) that they need someone doing the work on the ground today, especially on their websites. This includes updating product catalogues, order processing, providing refunds and engaging with customers. 
 Education required: High school certificate 
 Average hourly rate: Often low around $23 per hour (You can start your own business here instead) 
 Pros: Fun and dynamic! You'll be dealing with lots of different products and often several platforms such as Amazon, eBay and Shopify. 
 Cons: Another multi-tasking orientated job. Expect to do overtime during peak periods like Christmas and Black Friday. 
 5. Social media manager 
 One of the easiest jobs to get into is company social media management. Often you'll be managing a range of accounts, like 10 or 20 all at once. This will be across multiple platforms such as LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram. You'll be engaging with customers and dealing with reputation management, plus engaging with their content creators. 
 Education required: None. 
 Average hourly rate: Another low one around $22 per hour 
 Pros: Get paid to spend all day on Facebook and Instagram! 😉 
 Cons: Might be hard to focus on the role at hand. Also requires multi-task management. 
 6. Web designer 
 Now unlike the previous 5 I mentioned, this one is going to take some past knowledge. Even with my WordPress experience (almost 10 years now), I still struggle with the finer things of effective design online. Also, often web designers own their own businesses as freelancers, but sometimes you'll find people hiring for web designers and these are frequently startups who have taken on additional clients. 
 Education required: None but a high level of digital marketing knowledge. 
 Average hourly rate: $30+ per hour. It's hard to find good talent in Australia. 
 Pros: Get to work on some of the biggest websites out there behind the scenes. Most employers are totally cool with you working from home. 
 Cons: You need to be a certain "type" of person to enjoy this job role. It isn't for everyone. 
 7. Online tutoring 
 The world is going crazy for online education right now. Did you know that a lot of Chinese students need tutoring in English? Australia is often their 1st choice and in my opinion, this is one of the best work from home jobs you'll find that require no real experience. 
 Education required: ESL certificate generally at a minimum. 
 Average hourly rate: A friend of mine is paid $28 per hour. Quite impressive! 
 Pros: Get to talk to students around the world and help them with their English and Maths comprehension. 
 Cons: You'll rarely talk to other adults. Most people just do this part-time while at university. 
 8. Accounting/bookkeeping 
 These days a greater volume of Australian accountants are seeking to work from home. Most clients don't really come into the office as much anymore, prefering to communicate via phone and email. A friend of mine who is an accountant happens to just have 2 clients and works from…Thailand! Imagine that! And his 2 clients don't really care where he lives or works. 
 Education required: University degree 
 Average hourly rate: $35 to $100 per hour, depending on experience and work scope. 
 Pros: No need to dress the part! You'll probably get more work done without distracting office mates. 
 Cons: More lonely. Often requires you setting up a specific area to work, otherwise known as a home office and might need council approval. 
 9. Transcriptionist 
 Most people don't even know this job exists…but it does! And it's one of the best work from home jobs available. It's certainly one great opportunity where you can convert words into text. Such examples include putting subtitles on to videos or listing to audio files where children have spoken words and highlighted where they can improve. This role is very popular with Australian university students right now. 
 Education required: None (But must possess a high level of English) 
 Average hourly rate: $22 per hour 
 Pros: No experience needed and you can start tomorrow. There are many jobs sites around that are looking for reliable staff like yourself. 
 Cons: Can be boring…like really boring! Most people just do this gig on the side in the evenings. 
 10. Language translator 
 I know that not everyone is skilful in languages, but some people here in Australia do speak more than one language. They could, therefore, be the perfect candidate as a language translator. There are many platforms which are seeking those who can do this service very well, both written and audibly. Almost always a language translator would be working from home, so there is no need to worry there at all! 
 Education required: Bachelors degree at the minimum. 
 Average salary: $29 per hour 
 Pros: You can set your own work schedule. Get to meet a diverse range of clients. 
 Cons: Can be very lonely. Often limited communication with others directly. Requires very good accuracy in language translations. 
 11. Insurance claims auditor 
 A lot of insurance workers are starting to work from home, especially claims to audit. Like, say travel insurance claim auditors for instance where there is no need to travel anywhere to assess a damaged Macbook by a traveller in transit halfway across the world. More and more insurance companies are seeing the cost savings of having their staff work from home and even provide desks, computers and professional headsets to do their job properly. 
 Education required: None. Maybe require past experience. 
 Average salary: $26 per hour. 
 Pros: Get to talk to heaps of people. Low barrier of entry - you can start with minimal job experience. 
 Cons: Will require a quiet working space. Often are stuck on a 9 to 5 roster. 
 12. WordPress wizard 
 WordPress is a platform where 70% of websites are built today, including workwithjoshua.com 😃. In fact, almost every small business in Australia uses WordPress on their websites, since it's free and open source. The challenge is the technical ability that's needed to make changes to it. If you can learn WordPress (1 to 3 months) then you become desirable to a lot of employers. 
 Education required: None formally, but lots of experience in WordPress and some HTML. 
 Average salary: $27 per hour. 
 Pros: A skill that's very much needed in the world today. Can lead to bigger things over time. 
 Cons: Little to no verbal communication with people. HTML can get confusing. 
 13. Helpdesk Support 
 I should have placed this closer to the top of this list, but helpdesk support is one genuine job that you can do from home. A lot of Australian companies are now open to the potential of their staff working in a quiet space at home as it saves them on expensive desk space. 
 Education required: None. 
 Average salary: $25 per hour. 
 Pros: Easy to get a job as you're solving customer problems. Get to talk to lots of people. 
 Cons: Doesn't pay that well. Some customers can be downright rude. 
 14. Accident Claims Consultant 
 Similar to an insurance auditor, a claims consultant for accidents is the person you talk to when you have a car crash. They will assess who's at fault and where the liability sits. If you jump on Seek, you'll find numerous companies here in Australia offering full-time positions where employees can work from home. Sometimes you'll need to assess damaged cars in person which will be a welcome change from your home office. 
 Education required: None but experience often needed. 
 Average salary: $26 per hour. 
 Pros: Get to have a different task every day. No two accidents are the same. 
 Cons: You'll be resolving conflicts. Some people won't like to hear that they are at-fault. 
 15. Job Recruitment Advisor 
 I'm sure you've used a recruiting agency in the past to get a job, whether that's full time or casual. I certainly have! Some companies are now letting their staff work remotely from home, provided they have a stable internet connection and phone line. Most important is a distraction-free working environment. 
 Education required: Often TAFE at a minimum. 
 Average salary: $25 per hour. 
 Pros: Get to meet new job seekers every single day online. Can lead to big opportunities. 
 Cons: Some companies are challenging to deal with. High staff turn-over rate. 
 16. Travel Consultant 
 Whiel we can always book flights ourselves online, a travel consultant can often find a slightly better deal for us. Plus - they have local area knowledge since many travel consultants have traveled themselves. It's actually one of the best jobs to do if you want to travel and work at the same time, whether in Australia or across the world. 
 Education required: Nothing formally. 
 Average salary: $24 per hour plus commissions. 
 Pros: Meet excited travelers every single day. Get big discounts on flights and accommodation. 
 Cons: You don't get to travel as much yourself since you're having to work. An online business might be a better solution. 
 17. Mortgage Broker 
 I've been noticing online-only financing companies pop up in Australia in recent years, especially in Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney. While you can do loans for just about anything (cars, boats etc), I believe mortgage broking is the best as the salary is often higher. At times you might have to travel via car to meet clients at their house, but otherwise, 90% of the job of a mortgage broker can be done online from home. 
 Education required: Australian Credit Licence plus TAFE certificate. 
 Average salary: $23 per hour plus commissions (can be substantial) 
 Pros: Help people buy their 1st or 2nd property. Generally people are very friendly. 
 Cons: Can be boring. Always feels a bit 'institutional' to me. 
 18. Case Worker 
 You can be a case worker for many things. People immediately think of the Australian government, but our government often doesn't let people work from home. After all, they have plenty of office space that isn't costing them anything, unlike other businesses. 
 Education required: Varies 
 Average salary: $24 per hour. 
 Pros: Get to manage different projects. Engaging with people several times per day. 
 Cons: Hard to get a job where you can work 100% at home. Salary isn't the best. 
 19. Document Controller 
 I worked in the mining industry for 6 years and we had document controllers. I've noticed that logistics companies also have document controllers where their staff exceeds 200 people. WorkSafe has put a tough stance on Australian businesses over the last 10 years regarding workplace health and safety. For this reason, they need someone to ensure their compliance is rigid and especially their standard operating procedures. 
 Education required: TAFE and lots of industry experience. 
 Average salary: $28 per hour. 
 Pros: Fantastic for the resume. You'll be doing your part to improve workplace safety. 
 Cons: Requires technical knowledge. Not for the faint-hearted given the technical knowledge required around regulations and legislations. 
 20. Novated Lease Consultant 
 These are similar in some ways to car loan salespeople, but in this instance, their clients are professionals looking to take out a car loan for tax-deductible purposes. Almost all of this job role can be done from home. A popular company that I can recommend is Maxxia but I'm not sure if they allow people to work from home at this time. 
 Education required: Australian Credit Licence and some industry experience. 
 Average salary: $25 per hour plus bonuses for each car loan written. 
 Pros: You're dealing with mostly well-educated people. You could get a great deal on a car loan for yourself. 
 Cons: Requires lots of phone calls and interviewing potential candidates. Limited career growth. 
 21. Debt Collector 
 Ah…where would Australia be without debt collectors? We're massively in debt as a country and this industry now employs thousands of people. If you can handle the stress of dealing with people running away from their debts, then becoming a debt collector can be a good thing. This is especially true if you can sweet-talk people over the phone from home. 
 Education required: None but may require ACL licence. 
 Average salary: $24 per hour plus bonuses if debtors pay up. 
 Pros: Recession-proof job. You can pick up this job generally within a few weeks. 
 Cons: You're mostly dealing with negative people running from debts. Some companies don't allow people to work from home without prior experience. 
 22. Digital Marketer 
 This would have to be one of the best work from home jobs available in Australia. Except, often people become a digital marketer as a business owner. So to find a job like this, you need to search on the job boards or Facebook groups for those who already own their own businesses. 
 Education required: None but you will need established skills with experience. 
 Average salary: $32 per hour is common 
 Pros: A very much on-trend business. Very few people do this job well, so you can get paid more if you show enhanced results to your boss. 
 Cons: Requires technical ability which takes time to learn. Limited growth prospects despite the higher salary than most home-based jobs on this list. 
 23. Freight Coordinator 
 In rare instances, freight coordinators are allowed to work from home. Yes - you will need experience but you're really just scheduling freight between centres. In other words, you might schedule truckloads of stock between Melbourne and Sydney, or Perth and Brisbane overnight. A company might just need you on board for a few hours per day. 
 Education required: None but you will need logistics experience. 
 Average salary: $28 per hour (Often permanent roles too) 
 Pros: Diversity in the role. You have to solve challenging problems. 
 Cons: Dealing with negative people. Sometimes you wish you worked in the actual depot. 
 24. Email Manager 
 Email marketing has changed the world. Companies often need someone to handle their marketing via email. This includes campaign management, but also engagements with customers. Remember how many times that you've reached out to a company via email and they have replied the next day. That's a genuine job that you can do from home. While a lot of these roles are given to those in the Philippines, some Australian companies still prefer to hire locally. 
 Education required: None but some industry experience is a must. 
 Average salary: $23 per hour 
 Pros: Get to engage warmly with customers and resolve issues. No phone calls required. 
 Cons: Can be quite boring. Limited growth aspects. Salary is too low for most people. 
 25. IT Manager 
 While technology has changed the world, it has also brought us more problems. An IT manager is needed with most companies, and on some occasions, he or she can be based from home. This is especially true if the hardware side of things is managed by someone else, where you're the person managing the software and app development. 
 Education required: Bachelors of IT at a minimum (3 year degree) 
 Average salary: $29 per hour 
 Pros: Job security. Often resolving easy to address problems via email or over the phone. 
 Cons: People expect you to fix problems in 2 minutes or less. You'll be on-call most of the time. 
 26. Customer Service Representative 
 Similar to the helpdesk, a customer service representative deals with all inbound and sometimes outbound queries. You'll often be the 1st point of call when a customer needs a solution to their problems. You're the face of a company or business so you'll need to bring a big smile, despite the fact that customers won't even know that you're working from home. 
 Education required: None but genuine manners and positive attitude. 
 Average salary: $26 per hour. 
 Pros: Get to meet people over the phone several times per hour. Can lead to promotions. 
 Cons: Doesn't pay that well. You'll have to deal with some negative customers. Often are stuck on a 9am to 5pm roster. 
 27. Credit Assessor 
 While not quite a mortgage broker, a credit assessor is the person who checks the finance application of an individual. From here, they can pass on the final verdict to the broker or underwriter. If you've ever applied for a loan before, it's the credit assessor that says "APPROVED" or "DENIED" once they have received the paperwork. As a credit assessor, you're the person auditing that paperwork online matches up to the individual. 
 Education required: None but an Australian Credit Licence is needed. 
 Average salary: $27 per hour. 
 Pros: You don't have to do the entire job of a mortgage broker. Little to no direct interaction with customers. Flexible working hours. 
 Cons: Can be a bit boring. Limited growth prospects in this role. 
 28. Legal Writer 
 Some legal professions have moved away from fancy offices and dressing the part, and have since opted to work from home several times per week. Being a legal writer is one such role where you can now work from home but may require some office visits too. 
 Education required: Bachelors of Law and Legal Studies at a minimum. 
 Average salary: $36 per hour is common 
 Pros: Great job security and well paid. No need to get as dressed up as office work. 
 Cons: Can be boring without the workplace comradery. You'll need some daily motivation, but above all, the actual degree which takes 4 years. 
 29. Compliance Manager 
 All Australian companies are fearful of compliance issues right now. Even myself as an independent blogger. You should read more about my  earnings disclaimer  and  affiliate disclaimer  and even my  privacy policy  where you're here. Companies want to stay on the right side of the law, so they hire a compliance manager once they get to a certain size (usually above 50 employees). Sometimes they will let their compliance team to work online from home, either part-time or full-time. 
 Education required: Bachelors degree 
 Average salary: $33 per hour. 
 Pros: Career progression. Great job security and easy to switch to another company. 
 Cons: Requires a bachelor's degree. Also has technical aspects that is difficult for some people to comprehend. 
 30. Online chat engager 
 Even been on an online store and had someone chat to you in a small window? That's a real person who's almost always working from home. Truth be told that most of these are actually based in the Philippines or India, but as I've said more than once, some Australian companies are seeking local employees. 
 Education required: None 
 Average salary: $21 per hour 
 Pros: Easy to start - you'll find such jobs on  Seek  and other job boards. Flexible working hours including evenings and weekends, so you can do it around an existing full-time job. 
 Cons: Very low paying. Most customers aren't genuinely interested in the products but want to ask 101 questions. 
 31. Staff rostering officer 
 All companies need someone to roster on their staff members. Sometimes these rostering officers are able to work from home, but often not. Sometimes you might find a hybrid-model where you can work some days online at home and other days at the office. 
 Education required: TAFE 
 Average salary: $26 per hour 
 Pros: Generally smooth sailing. Most engagement is for organizing sick days and annual leave loadings. 
 Cons: Can be a bit boring. Often harder to find jobs like this where you can exclusively work from home. 
 32. Draftsperson 
 Most draftspeople I've met actually work from home. They (often a small team of 2 to 3) just have their own office at the front to meet clients. Occasionally they might visit local job sites or the council office, or even meet a client, but otherwise, it's all done from home. This saves on expensive office rental leases. 
 Education required: TAFE. Architects require university degrees. 
 Average salary: $29 per hour. 
 Pros: Job flexibility. A chance to run your own business if you choose. 
 Cons: Requires specialized knowledge. Work can be seasonal. 
 33. Online trainer/assessor 
 Online education is big business in Australia, with more than 100 RTO's offering the TAE40116. A lot of students choose to do their training online instead of face-to-face nowadays which gives you a great opportunity if you know your stuff. Many registered training organizations allow their staff to work from home if they can genuinely do their job properly. 
 Education required: Diploma in Training and Assessment at a bare minimum. 
 Average salary: $31 per hour. 
 Pros: You're helping workers to upskill for the future. Flexible working hours. 
 Cons: Can be a tad boring. Requires past industry experience and certifications. 
 34. Family support worker 
 This one is rare but I do sometimes see job listings on Seek where they are requiring a family support worker. It's also rare for these to be direct with the Australian government but keep an eye on the website. 
 Education required: Bachelors degree. 
 Average salary: $26 per hour. 
 Pros: Helping young children at risk. Range of projects which you can tackle. 
 Cons: Can be a little challenging for the weak-hearted. May have limited career progression. 
 35. Operations Manager 
 Every company needs an Operations Manager. Did you know that there are some companies now that are exclusively online? Like even with 50 employees which are all working from home around the world. It's crazy! If you have industry experience, then you can look on international job boards to become an operations manager, even while being based in Australia. 
 Education required: Bachelors degree and lots of experience. 
 Average salary: $40 per hour. 
 Pros: Well paid role for those who want to work from home successfully. Get to work on some cool projects. 
 Cons: You'll need to have already worked your way up. Timezone challenges if you choose to work with a multi-national company. 
 36. Backlink Extraordinaire 
 As an SEO addict, one of the challenges is building backlinks successfully. Quite often bloggers like myself are more than happy to get others to do this job…and it's well-paying too! If you like writing great content, then becoming a person who specializes in backlinks is the god-send of many people in the SEO niche. 
 Education required: None but you will need experience here. 
 Average salary: $37 per hour. 
 Pros: Often well paid, especially for SaaS clients. It's a results-orientated approach to income. 
 Cons: Requires technical abilities and frequent use of Ahrefs. Can be very lonely. 
 37. Software Developer 
 I can easily say that this is one of the most popular and genuine work at home jobs that Australians do. The thing is…if you're a software developer, you already know about it. This is why it's not near the top of this list, but worth mentioning for a potential career-change. 
 Education required: Bachelor's degree and experience. 
 Average salary: $35 per hour. 
 Pros: You get paid to write code all day long. Growth prospects are everywhere. 
 Cons: Another lonely job. Requires discipline to stay focused on the job. 
 38. Data Entry Specialist 
 This is another data-entry job where it's often found in the Philippines or India where labour is cheaper. That said, you're by now aware that Australian companies do like to hire local employees where it is possible. The job of a data entry specialist is often done by university students, either after hours or on weekends. 
 Education required: None but you'll need good Math and English skills. 
 Average salary: $20 per hour. 
 Pros: Super easy to get into. Look into the international and local job boards. 
 Cons: Really boring to do repetitive tasks. Limited growth opportunities. 
 39. Inventory Manager 
 A lot of online stores now require an inventory manager. If you take on this role, you'll need to be placing orders with suppliers locally or in other countries, while also managing seasonal variations of products. Tasks include updating SKUs, warehouse locations across NSW, WA, SA, VIC and QLD….and might even include SEO for your company. 
 Education required: Often none but they do like genuine experience. 
 Average salary: $25 per hour. 
 Pros: You get to take charge of the role. Might get discounts on products. Excellent job for your CV. 
 Cons: You'll need some experience. Sometimes online stores growth too fast for you to keep up with the workflow. 
 40. Product Photographer 
 So I'm not talking everyday photography here. In this role, you'll be working from home exclusively and photographing small-scale products for online store owners. This can include jewellery, knitting supplies, stationary and more. They will send you the products, you photograph them and send them back. It's that simple and more-so a business than a job. 
 Education required: None but you will need professional equipment and experience. 
 Average salary: $28 per hour (bring your own camera gear) 
 Pros: Get to work with lots of different products. Set your own hours with limited restrictions. 
 Cons: Very little human contact. Requires the upfront capital to invest in equipment. 
 41. Payroll Officer 
 Similar to a rostering person, payroll officers manage the payments from employers to employees in an organization. Often these people don't meet employees face-to-face and instead prefer to communicate via phone and email. 
 Education required: TAFE or Uni 
 Average salary: $26 per hour 
 Pros: Very hard to be made redundant from. Job role very much outlined. 
 Cons: Stuck on a typical 9am to 5pm roster. Limited career progression. 
 42. Human Resources Officer 
 Where would an organization be without a human resources officer?! Some companies today in Australia are offering the chance for employees to transition to a part-time or full-time work from home arrangement. 
 Education required: Bachelors degree 
 Average salary: $33 per hour. 
 Pros: Great career progression. Get to meet new employees over the phone and emails. 
 Cons: Must be good at dispute resolution. You'll need experience and a degree first. 
 43. Business Development Manager 
 Once a business gets over a certain size, they need someone in charge of building it even bigger. This person is often called the Business Development Manager. In my case, both my Amazon businesses are stretching beyond what I'm capable of, so I'll be hiring in late 2020. Any takers? 
 Education required: TAFE, Uni and some real business experience. 
 Average salary: $34 per hour. 
 Pros: Get to take charge of someone else's business, but without the risks. Great for the CV. 
 Cons: It's still their business. Some ideas will fall on deaf ears. 
 44. Contracts Administrator 
 Australian companies sometimes take on huge contracts to deliver a large product or service offering. They might only take a few of these on each year. Someone needs to administer the deliverables and that person can be you. 
 Education required: Generally, university degrees are requested. 
 Average salary: $32 per hour. 
 Pros: Get to manage different projects. Great opportunity to progress in your career. 
 Cons: Requires a dedicated office space at home with no interruptions. You'll probably be stuck on a 9am to 5pm roster with limited flexibility. 
 45. Customs Broker 
 At a recent seminar I went to, I discovered that Customs Brokers are paid very well. Like 6 figure incomes at times. Now, very few are given the freedom of working from home and processing import documents online, but it does happen. It's more-so common in Sydney, but those in Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth might find some success here. 
 Education required: University degree 
 Average salary: $39 per hour. 
 Pros: Hard to find great brokers means that you are guaranteed job security. Also has great career progression. 
 Cons: The challenges of dealing with clients of different cultural backgrounds. Also requires university degree. 
 46. Course Consultant 
 I said this previously in this article, but so many people are looking at online courses right now. The education sector in Australia is so strong, and the best news is that course consultants now have the choice of working remotely from home. On the other hand, face-to-face training will still require visits to your usual workplace. 
 Education required: TAFE or RTO (Diploma) 
 Average salary: $29 per hour. 
 Pros: Easy to transition to a home-based working lifestyle. Get to help people make important career decisions that will positively impact their future. 
 Cons: You're often stuck on a usual 9am to 5pm office roster. Also will need a dedicated workspace at home. 
 47. Data Analyst 
 The job of a Data Analyst is often overlooked as one that can genuinely be done from home. Truth be told…that these are some of the most sort-after staff around. Even if you're Australian, I would seek roles with international companies as they would often pay a higher salary and sometimes in US dollars. 
 Education required: University degree at a minimum. 
 Average salary: $33 per hour. 
 Pros: You can work with local or international companies. A great way to travel and work at the same time. 
 Cons: Has a deep technical aspect to the role. You'll often have to bring your own equipment. 
 48. SEO Consultant 
 Google is changing its rules every day and SEO is more important than ever. Here in Australia, we have so many digital marketing agencies which are looking for SEO consultants that can serve their clients. I've even been asked a few times to provide this service to other Australian bloggers, but I'm too busy with my Amazon FBA projects right now. 
 Education required: None - you learn SEO with real experience. That's all. 
 Average salary: $30 per hour (Up to $50 per hour if you produce rock-star results) 
 Pros: One of the hottest jobs right now paired with digital marketing agencies which have a fun-approach to life. Very flexible working hours and you can get employment with international companies. 
 Cons: SEO takes years to learn and master properly. You might find running your own SEO agency more lucrative… 🙂 
 49. Life Coach 
 I know about 10 life coaches personally and another 30 or so on Facebook. They are all working from home or the coffee shop. I even know a few working remotely from Bali, despite their clients who think they are based in Australia. Obviously this is more-so a personal business thing as opposed to a job where you work for someone else. 
 Education required: Self help seminar 🙃 
 Average salary: $70 per hour (but you might only see 1 or 2 clients per day online) 
 Pros: Low barrier to entry and if you're a charismatic person, you can positively impact someone's life. Great flexibility in when and where you work. 
 Cons: Really low paying actually, with most earning less than the average Australian salary. Often perceived as an industry of "fake it till you make it" crowd. 
 50. Advertising Manager 
 Most medium and large companies need an advertising department and you could be an advertising lead or campaigns manager. Often you will need demonstrated experience of working in an office before transitioning towards a work-at-home setup, but it's certainly been done before. 
 Education required: Often these companies ask for university degrees. 
 Average salary: $35 per hour. 
 Pros: As you're the life-blood of a company succeeding, it's hard to be fired. A good way to find international companies that will still hire Australian employees. 
 Cons: Strong KPIs lead to some advertising managers burning out. 50 hours per week is normal in this job. 
 51. Team Leader 
 While different to the Operations Manager, a team leader has to look after a small team of 5 to 20 people. Yes - this can be done remotely but you should expect to sometimes travel to the office to conduct meetings and train new employees, while reviewing the performance of others. 
 Education required: Most people will require a university degree. 
 Average salary: $34 per hour. 
 Pros: Dynamic work environment and a chance for promotions. Well paid and great rewards on offer for those who work hard. 
 Cons: It can be challenging to manage different types of people, especially remotely. Will require a distraction-free work environment and reliable internet connection at the minimum. 
 52. Business Owner 
 I've hinted at this several times in this article showing the best Australian jobs where you can work from home. Being a business owner is literally like living the dream. You call the shots and you're in full control. You can even hire employees if you desire, either in-house with an office at home or remotely. My staff are all (at this time) not based in Australia. 
 Education required: None (I don't have any business education. I learned from experience. 
 Average salary: $50 per hour (but you take on more risks) 
 Pros: The very best way to have total flexibility of when and where you work in the 21 century. There are so many things you can do as well, as long as it is online. 
 Cons: It's seriously hard work to build a business. I should know! There is also competition too in anything which you chase after. 
 Next steps: Get started working from home 
 I hope this in-depth article showcasing 52 online jobs which you can do from home has given you some encouragement and ideas. Don't waste time but actually get out there and start submitting your applications for job roles. That's the only way to make a change in your life. 
 Definitely the one that changed my life was an online business. 
 It wasn't easy or fast, and sometimes not fun either. But if you're committed for the long haul, the rewards are certainly on the table.

 Hi Joshua, have been enjoying reading your blogs lately! I’m looking into doing a course to start selling on amazon - do you recommend reliable education or Sophie Howard? 
Thanks Nicola

 Hi Nicola, thanks so much for the feedback! 
 Hmm so both courses are quite different and I've compared the two here:  https://www.workwithjoshua.com/adam-hudson-vs-sophie-howard-a-comparison-of-the-2-amazon-fba-courses/ 
 Adam's is best for those very serious about building a proper brand. Sophie's is best for the beginner type that wants support and mentoring along the way. So essentially, it really depends on where you come from and what you hope to get out of an education package.

 Important: Earnings and Legal Disclaimer 
 In the real world and in the online world, I don’t believe that anyone finds instant success. 
I believe in hard work, creating success over the long term, adding value and serving others. That’s where my recommended programs can help you. 
 Sadly, there is a minority who want overnight success paired with unrealistic expectations. 
 As stated by law, I can not and do not make any guarantees about your own ability to get results or earn any money with my ideas, information, recommended programs or strategies. I don’t know you and, besides, your results in business are created by you. 
 I’m here to help by showing you some good strategies to move you forward a little faster. However, nothing on this page or any of my pages, websites or emails is a promise or guarantee of future earnings. Nothing is a promise of potential earnings. 
 I’ve taken this a step further and you can read more:  Earnings disclaimer 
 It takes hard work, capital and time invested over the long term to build any business online successfully. 
If you’re looking for something simple, easy, fast and cheap, then I’m certainly not the person for you. You'll find those magic bullets elsewhere. 
 And with that…now we can both take a breathe and exhale!
