 Steve Jobs - a tribute… 
 Posted on  October 7, 2011  by   paulgarland 
 …I couldn't let yesterday's events go unmarked - the sad news of the loss to the world of a true visionary and a person who has changed my life personally,  along with the vast majority of the planet  , but certainly all who work in the fields of design, photography and artwork. This is not something that I would normally attempt, so how successful it is or isn't is not really for me to say. 
 Best wishes to the Jobs family and friends and also of course best wishes and good luck for the future to Apple!
