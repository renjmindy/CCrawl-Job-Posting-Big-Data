 Remote 
 We’re Red Thread Games, the studio behind  Dreamfall Chapters  and  Draugen , and we’re looking for a game designer to join us and help build our new game: a narrative-driven, third person action-adventure for PC and consoles. 
 As game designer, you’ll take responsibility for designing, implementing and scripting content, game mechanics and features in the Unity game engine, working together with a tight-knit team of developers in downtown Oslo, Norway. 
 The job requires prior experience with Unity, with  playable  examples of games you’ve worked on. Professional game industry background or commercially shipped games are  not  required: hobby and student projects are perfectly acceptable for submission! 
 ‍ 
 Job Description 
 If hired, you’ll join our studio to work on  Dustborn , a 3D adventure that blends narrative with action in an original and exciting setting in development for PC and consoles. 
 You’ll collaborate with a friendly team of designers, programmers and artists to design and implement content and game mechanics. Your work will span all game systems and features, including combat, world interaction systems, character dialogue and puzzles. 
 Your role will touch on many different areas of development, and requires at least a basic understanding of game development and design processes, user interfaces and experiences, game systems and mechanics. 
 Given the current global health crisis, the development team is working remotely. Candidates for this position must be prepared to work from home for a period, and until further notice, before potential relocation is possible and advisable. 
 ‍ 
 Responsibilities 
 
 Under direction from the lead designer and game director, you’ll design, prototype and script content and game features using the Unity engine and in-house tools 
 Collaborate with the design team, artists, animators and programmers to deliver content, systems and features 
 Participate in the ongoing development of tools and technologies to improve workflows 
 Partake in regular design meetings and brainstorming sessions 
 Work independently to ensure your tasks are delivered on time and to a high quality 
 
 ‍ 
 Qualifications 
 
 You’ll have worked on  at least  one playable game (preferably several) in a design position: this can be a mod, a hobby or student project, or a commercially available title that we can play. Please include both a download link  and  a video with game footage 
 Excellent grasp of the English language — written and spoken. Norwegian language skills are  not  required for this position 
 A passion for interactive storytelling, RPGs, adventure games and action-adventure games. If you’ve played our previous games, that’s a bonus! 
 Multidisciplinary, agile, curious and eager to learn 
 Prior experience with Unity  required . Unreal Engine experience is a plus 
 
 ‍ 
 What we 're looking for. 
 We’re looking for curious, creative and friendly folks who share our love for storytelling, role-playing and adventure games. 
 Professional experience helps a lot (and is required for some positions) but we’re willing to take a chance on you if you have an exceptional portfolio, a willingness to learn, and we believe you’ll function well on the team. 
 (Also, if you’ve played and enjoyed our previous games, you should definitely let us know.) 
 We're deeply committed to inclusiveness and diversity in the game industry, and we strongly encourage women, non-binary people, persons of colour and minorities to apply for positions at Red Thread. 
 ‍ 
 **  The Coronavirus ** 
 The virus affects us all, and even though Norway has weathered the crisis well, and Red Thread Games has continued operating through the pandemic (with most of our crew working remotely), it does mean that international recruitment is challenging. We’re therefore open to adding remote employees to our team, who can hopefully transition to on-site employees when the borders open up again.

 About Dustborn 
 Lead a band of misfits and outcasts on a thrilling road-trip across a Divided States of America. A story-driven action-adventure about hope, love, friendship, robots…and the power of words. 
 ‍ 
 ‍ 
 About our studio. 
 Our team has development experience from games like The Longest Journey, Dreamfall, Anarchy Online, Age of Conan, The Secret World, Dreamfall Chapters, Draugen — and many others. We’re passionate about our work: we love games, we love telling stories, and we love working together in a collaborative and creative environment where everyone gets to contribute and learn from each other. 
 Red Thread makes story-driven games for PC and consoles, and we’re currently working on several exciting titles, including  Dustborn  and Svalbard.  ‍ 
 ‍ 
 ‍ 
 Common to all positions. 
 We’re looking for candidates who are curious, motivated, self-driven and who can demonstrate initiative and a positive attitude — preferably with prior game development experience — along with a relevant university/college degree, an exceptional portfolio, and professional references. 
 You’ll be joining a small indie studio working out of a cosy office in downtown  Oslo, Norway . We occupy the third floor of a  beautiful and historic 146 year old building , with  two   restaurants  and a  café/bar  on the first floor, a pizzeria/bar and an  amazing coffee-and-sandwich place  across the street, a  Japanese Izakaya  around the corner, and multiple grocery stores, lunch bars and cafés just minutes away. 
 We’re a ten-minute walk from much of what  central Oslo  has to offer, including all public transportation, malls, museums, parks, restaurants and nightlife — and the forest and fjord are only 15 minutes away by metro or bus. Oslo has been ranked #7 on the  list of the world’s happiest cities , and  Norway ranks fifth on the list of happiest countries . What we’re saying is: this is a  happy  place! 
 We don’t believe in crunch time at Red Thread. We believe that family, friends, and a thriving personal life are more important than work, and that people are more creative and productive when they’re also happy and healthy. We work five days a week, seven-and-a-half hours a day. We have five weeks of annual holiday, along with flexible work hours. And don’t let anyone tell you there’s no such thing as a free lunch: we serve one every day! 
 We’re looking for people of all colours, genders, ethnic backgrounds, religious beliefs and sexual orientations who fit in with our passionate, experienced and inclusive team of artists, designers and developers. We expect everyone to contribute, and in return you get to shape our games, worlds and stories for years to come!
