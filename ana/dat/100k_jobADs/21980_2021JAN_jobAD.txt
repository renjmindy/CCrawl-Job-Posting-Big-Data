 After smashing our goals in 2019, we've expanded our offices and we're ready to invest in growing our Logistics & Supply Chain team. We're not looking for another cog in the machine or a number at a desk, we're looking for someone energetic and innovative to be the driving force of our expansion. 
 Does this sound like you? 
 
 Focused, driven and hard-working recruitment consultant operating in any market within the private sector; 
 Proven track record with a minimum 2 years' continuous experience; 
 Grounded, down-to-earth and able to hold your own with a diverse pool of candidates and clients. 
 
 That's enough about you (for now), who are we? 
 We are Gleeson Recruitment Group and we pride ourselves in supporting ambitious individuals into reaching their full potential. We've invested in our office space, our tech and our staff to ensure that they have the tools, training and environment that they need to provide the best service possible for our clients and candidates. Our recruitment process isn't a tick box exercise; we trust our teams to run their own desks - no cold calls, no unsolicited CVs and no beatings with the infamous KPI stick. In doing so, we've built a culture of accountability and grown up ideals that have led to Gleeson becoming the standard bearer in the Birmingham recruitment market. We believe that there are two elements of a successful recruitment consultant that you simply can't force, and they are personality and determination - so long as you have the personality to fit in here and the hunger to succeed, we can teach you the rest. 
 What's in it for you? 
 Our clear progression structure provides every employee with the opportunity to excel and expand their current skillset and we offer every member of staff the potential to earn a wealth of unique benefits including, but not limited to: 
 
 4.5 day working week 
 Additional holiday purchase 
 An annual trip abroad 
 Flexitime and home-working 
 Quarterly staff socials 
 
 If you're frustrated by the environment and opportunities available to you and looking for a fun, supportive business to build a career - we have the expertise to get you there. Our aim is to obtain talented staff, who embody our company values, and give them a fantastic environment to better themselves. 
 So, if you want to be a valued member of a small but growing team, in one of the fastest growing recruitment businesses in the region, get in touch with Phil Birch on 07970-211517 or apply with your CV. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
