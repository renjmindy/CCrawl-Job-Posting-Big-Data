 ABOUT US 
 Please note: We are not currently hiring remote engineers 
 Our Product 
 ‚ÄúPoint provides the opportunity to stabilize your financial situation without adding costly monthly payments.‚Äù - Homeowner in Burlingame, CA 
 Here at Point, we‚Äôre helping homeowners unlock the equity in their homes without taking on further debt. With an investment from Point, homeowners can de-leverage and diversify their wealth, freeing them up to invest in their business, renovate and maintain their home, eliminate debt, and tackle all of life‚Äôs expenses from college tuition to medical bills. Our equity investment product is an advantageous alternative for homeowners and investors alike. When partnering with Point, investors now have access to a brand new asset class - homeowner-occupied residential real estate. Point is the first fintech product that is truly aligned with consumers‚Äô interests - when the homeowner does well, Point and its investors do well. 
 Our Team 
 People first 
 As a consumer fintech company, we embed integrity, transparency, and trust into everything we do at Point, including how we work. Whether you‚Äôre a homeowner, investor, employee, or candidate, it‚Äôs people who power our business. We keep the human experience top of mind. 
 Experts at work 
 We‚Äôre on a mission to help the 23 million equity-rich, but cash-constrained Americans tap into their home‚Äôs wealth. To do so, we have experience and expertise in all areas of the business, especially at the helm. Point‚Äôs leadership have previously founded TrialPay (acquired by Visa), Yub (acquired by Coupons.com), Metails (acquired by Buy.com), SiteAdvisor (acquired by McAfee), Affirm, SendGrid (acquired by Twilio), and TXN (acquired by Envestnet). 
 Championed by the best 
 In 2019, Point closed a $22M Series B led by Prudential Financial, DAG Ventures, and Andreessen Horowitz. We‚Äôve received funding from Ribbit Capital, Greylock, SV Angel and Bloomberg Beta as well. 
 ROLE OVERVIEW 
 You will be an integral part of a tight-knit engineering team working to design and implement new features, improve our architecture and take the lead to launch new products. 
 Our tech stack is anchored by Ruby on Rails, React, PostgreSQL and Heroku. 
 RESPONSIBILITIES 
 
 Design and engineer the marketplace tech to make shared equity financing a great option for homeowners and investors 
 Collaborate with the design team and product managers to create an engaging and transparent customer experience 
 Build analytics tools to capture and use data to drive risk and pricing algorithms and inform marketing spend 
 Automate data collection from multiple vendors and data sources and organize and index that data 
 Streamline the underwriting process to improve efficiency and accuracy while delivering cash to homeowners faster 
 
 YOU ARE 
 
 Quality driven -- You are able to work fast and deliver fast, check your work and take pride in shipping quality. 
 Innovative -- You take the initiative to find new ways to solve problems. You help the team understand your point of view and advocate for great solutions. 
 Expert -- You know a couple of languages cold and learning new technologies is standard fare. Specialization at one level of the stack (front-end, back-end, etc.) is great, but expect to work on everything from front-end to the database to the deployment as the need arises. 
 Experienced -- We don‚Äôt count years, but you should have some solid work experience under your belt. Expect to hit the ground running. 
 
 If you love engineering and are passionate about creating software that makes a meaningful difference to our customers‚Äô financial health, you belong at Point.

 Generous vacation

 Work from home & Flexibility 
 Many team members work from home once a week. We care about productivity and accountability, not face time. 
 Continued Learning

 Family Friendly

Point is the first consumer finance product that is truly aligned with the customer. When the homeowner does well, Point and its investors do well. We are a well-financed, fast-growing startup backed by top investors like Andreessen Horowitz, located in downtown Palo Alto just minutes from Caltrain. Point's founders have previously co-founded TrialPay (acquired by Visa), Yub (acquired by Coupons.com), Metails (acquired by Buy.com), SiteAdvisor (acquired by McAfee), Affirm, SendGrid (acquired by Twilio), and TXN (aquired by Envestnet).
