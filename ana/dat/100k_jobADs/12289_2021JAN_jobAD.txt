  3 Reasons To Go For That Risky Dream Career  
 Amanda Green 
 May 26, 2013 
 All too often, people are forced to choose between a career that offers stability and one that they actually find meaning and passion in - the  risky dream career . They want to be journalists, artists, or even musicians, but they worry that they will fail and end up on welfare prompt them to become something they don't really like, but something that pays the bills. This is an unfortunate but true fact of life. Finding a career that you truly enjoy is almost as important as finding the right spouse and seeking out your passions. Money is important and job security is great, but nothing beats doing something that makes you happy – doing something that you love. If you’re one of the many people who have chosen practicality over passion, you’re probably reading this and thinking to yourself,  Of course it always sounds good in theory to pursue your dreams, but how am I supposed to actually upend my life and take such a risk upon myself?  This is a valid question to ask. Certainly, giving up your current job for the sake of a dream career is easier said than done. But if it’s something you’ve been considering for a while, all you really need is that final push of confidence in order to go forward. 
 
 3 Reasons To Go For That Risky Dream Career 
 Here are some tips to help you convince yourself and secure that confidence: 
 1. Don’t Take The Future For Granted 
 We’ve all heard the saying “Live each day as though it is your last.” But many of us do not truly appreciate the implications until we are faced with the untimely death or debilitation of someone close to us. We all want to believe that we will live to an old age, but a central fact of life is that nothing in this world is a given. Your health is far more important than any job, and you should look into some healthier lifestyle choices like working out in addition to a career. Pure Formulas is an excellent example of some natural, organic supplements one can take to assist a busy life (find out more and  buy it here ). On this note, don’t let yourself keep pushing your dream job further into the future. Instead, live as though you don’t have much time left. 
 2. Believe In Your Passion 
 In any field or industry, the most successful people may be those who have the greatest amount of luck, possess the most inherent intelligence, or simply achieved their position due to family connections. Many of these attributes cannot be controlled, but there is one controllable determinant that directly correlates with success: passion. If you are deeply motivated in your dream job you are more likely to be successful and less liable to fail. 
 3. Assess Your Current Career 
 Wanting to pursue a dream job is just as much a function of that dream as it is a reflection of your current career. After all, even though countless boys grow up wanting to be an astronaut, almost all of them find other professions that they ultimately would rather do. Ask yourself: Are you happy in your current line of work? Do you get satisfaction and contentment out of it? Are you okay with the thought of doing this for the rest of your career? If yes, then your dream job may no longer carry an alluring luster. If you answer no, however, then you need to compare your options and seriously question what will make you happier. Hopefully these tips will help convince you to pursue the career path that can truly make you happy. While the road to happiness is often a bumpy and winding one, you will never reach your destination if you don’t embark on the journey in the first place.
