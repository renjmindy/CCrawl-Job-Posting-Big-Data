 Broken promises & fresh starts

 SRxA ’s  Word on Health  can’t help but wonder how  Abbott  employees are feeling today after learning that 3,000 jobs are to be cut. According to  Bloomberg , the corporate axe will fall as part of the company’s restructuring plan following its acquisition of  Solvay ’s pharmaceuticals business. 
 How ironic and painful it must be each time they see their corporate mission statement: “ A Promise For Life .” 
 So who will stay and who will go? According to the company, most of the positions to be eliminated will be in sales, corporate staff, manufacturing and research. While we’re not quite sure who that leaves, we do know that there will soon be a lot more pharma people out there looking for jobs. 
 Though few Abbott workers will take comfort from the fact that the restructuring will result in savings of $810 to $970 million over the next two years, they are certainly not alone. 
 2010 has been a busy year for the  pharma chopping block . A Google search on “pharmaceutical sales job cuts + 2010” elicited 331,000 results. 
 
 In the last quarter alone,  Astra Zeneca ,  Merck ,  GlaxoSmithKline ,  Pfizer ,  Roche ,  Takeda , and  UCB  have all announced significant reductions of their sales force. 
 It’s all a far, far cry from the pharmaceutical industry zenith of 2004 when roughly 105,000 sales reps were employed in the US. 
 These latest job cuts appear to support the notion that the pharmaceutical industry is moving away from transactional selling to more value-oriented or solution-oriented selling. Without its traditional army of sales reps the pharmaceutical industry will need to come up with new and better ways of engaging the physicians.
