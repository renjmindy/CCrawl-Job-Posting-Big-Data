 Boring? or Life Changing? 
 Jesus said, 'If my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it shall be done for you.' 
 What a promise from Jesus? How does it work? 
 When I was 15, we had just moved to Norcross (outside of Atlanta) and my parents and friends from church encouraged me to memorize Bible verses topic by topic. I had a pretty boring summer job so it gave me something to do mentally while I picked up trash, cleaned carpets and scrubbed the pool at an apartment complex. 
 I don't remember how many of those verses I memorized. 
 But lately I've been reviewing. And it's amazing how many of them are still in my mind. And in my heart and life. I have had a pretty clear picture of who God is, how to live by faith in Christ, how to fight against temptation and live in Christ while in this world. I'm far from some super-Christian but I think I'm doing well. 
 It has something to do with God 's Word being in me, I think.  Let me recommend to you the  Navigators' Topical Memory System . Or any system that will get God's Word to abide in you. 
 Going back to Jesus' words I started with: I have not gotten every single thing that I have wished for - because often my wishes were flat out wrong and I didn't know it - but I've grown to understand and celebrate what Jesus has done for me. 
 And I'm learning to ask for things that line up with His will. Like that you would memorize Scripture. 
 It might sound boring. But if you feel that, you're wrong. It's life changing.

 Calling or Crushing 
 … thinking of work mainly as a means to self-fulfillment and self-realization slowly crushes a person… and undermines society itself. * 
 Do planters and pastors drink the Kool-aid that says, "I have to plant a successful church or I'm a nobody. I'll have failed. I can't fail." Do I as a coach who wants to succeed at language school and serve in Cuba? Yes. 
 What do you feel about your job? 
 Is your job ultimately for you or for others? Is it crushing you? 
 A calling is something that is from the outside of you.  From someone else, for others . Not for yourself. It is a mission. A service to Someone. It's not for your sake. When you and I think "my job is for me and mine" we miss the freedom and purpose of a calling 
 Maybe that's one reason church planters struggle so fiercely when attendance is low, or someone critiques you or you aren't getting everything done that you think you should. 
 Maybe we all should consider our jobs as a calling. Look at it in light of this: Jesus answered the call to be crushed in our place and in doing so he grants to us God's plan for our lives for others' sake. 
 *Page 2 of Every Good Endeavor by Keller and Alsdorf, quoting Bellah's Habits of the Heart.
