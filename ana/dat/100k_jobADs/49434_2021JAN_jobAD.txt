 April 19, 2017 
 job (noun)   LISTEN  
 "I love my job!" 
 A  job  is work that we do for money. If you have a job, it means that someone is paying you because you are doing something for them.

 A  job  is also something that you have to do, usually because your boss or another person asks you to do it.

 It can also be something that you  should  do because you  agreed  to do it, or because other people think you will do it.

 Common uses 
 When someone does something well, we often say that they did a good job. For example, "You did a good job cleaning the house today. It  looks  great!" You can also say just "Good job!" which is very common in US English. In the UK we usually say, "Well done!" instead.
