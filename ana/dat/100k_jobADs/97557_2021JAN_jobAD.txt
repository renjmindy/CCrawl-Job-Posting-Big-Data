 Job: Info about Becoming a MEDLINE Indexer 
 Posted on  May 30, 2016  by   sarahgprescott 
 Reply 
 5.30.16 -  Becoming an Indexer for MEDLINE … 
 Sarah P 's comments : I was recently contacted by a qualified Health Sciences librarian (with a biomedical degree as well as MLIS) who is searching for a virtual position because there are no local opps in her area. I have a friend who worked for the NLM (USA) as an indexer and I also happen to be taking a course in Health Sciences myself. This week's homework included learning how to use PubMed so I also looked into how to become a virtual indexer for them. 
 While this is mainly a USA opportunity, it is important to note that "citizenship is not mandatory for contractors" and that "about 1% of MEDLINE indexing is performed by indexers at the International MEDLARS Centers in Sweden and Brazil". 
 Here is some information from their Frequently Asked Questions Page: 
 Who are the indexers, and what are their qualifications? 
 Most MEDLINE indexers are either Federal employees or employees of firms that have contracts with NLM for biomedical indexing. A prospective indexer must have no less than a bachelor's degree in a biomedical science. A reading knowledge of certain modern foreign languages is typically sought. An increasing number of recent recruits hold advanced degrees in biomedical sciences. Federal employees must be United States citizens, but citizenship is not mandatory for contractors. 
 Indexers are trained in principles of MEDLINE indexing, using the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) controlled vocabulary as part of individualized training. The initial part of the training is based on an online training module (partially available to the public at  http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/indexing/index.html ), followed by a period of practice indexing. NLM does not accept other indexing training programs as a substitute. 
 About 1% of MEDLINE indexing is performed by indexers at the International MEDLARS Centers in Sweden and Brazil. 
 
 How can I become an indexer? 
 Indexing vacancies at the National Library of Medicine are filled competitively. Any such vacancy is listed on  NLM's Web site . Indexers generally are classified as Technical Information Specialists, in the GS-1412 job series. The normal career ladder goes from GS-9 to GS-12. 
 For information about applying for work as an indexer with NLM's contractors, please contact the Index Section for a listing of all firms with a current indexing contract. 
 
 I've heard that I can do indexing work at home. How do I apply for this type of position? 
 Contract indexers work from their homes once their training has been completed. Indexers who are Federal employees may qualify to telework for two or three days each week under the NIH Telework Program. See the preceding paragraph for information on applying for either type of indexing position. 
 
 How can I apply for a job as an abstract writer for MEDLINE? 
 No original abstracts are created for MEDLINE. Author abstracts in English published in a journal are input for MEDLINE. 
 
 How can I apply for a job as a translator with the Index Section? 
 Although journals from many languages are represented in MEDLINE, the National Library of Medicine does not translate the articles. Indexers who perform subject analysis of the articles typically have a reading knowledge of scientific terminology in one or more foreign languages. They read and comprehend the articles, but they do not need to translate them in order to index them.

 2.29.16 -  Virtual Researchers 
USA/Worldwide 
 Sarah P 's comments : I received an e-mail from a Research Manager at Wonder asking whether I would be willing to post this opportunity. After some initial research, I can say they are a legitimate company. Here is some more information about working for this company, and also the job description and application link which was shared with me. For the sake of others please share your experience with this company. 
 FYI: Wonder  does not  hire residents of California, New York, and Massachusetts however I inquired about non-US citizens and received the following reply. 'Our research positions are open to all, and we welcome non-US citizens. All payment is done through PayPal to make it easy for those outside the US. Our only requirement is a  strong command of the English language .'

 (FAQs,  Application , and details below) 
 Wonder ( askwonder.com ) is a personal research assistant that saves people time by getting detailed answers and resources delivered to their inboxes by a trusted network of researchers. 
 We’re looking for individuals with exceptional online research skills to join our community of independent paid researchers. Wonder clients post questions about various topics in economics, business, technology, product recommendations and more, and your job is to efficiently track down the highest quality resources across the Web and explain the results in a personable, human way. Wonder allows you to combine your researching skills as a librarian (or library sciences student) with your desire to help provide knowledge to those who seek it, and to get paid in the process. 
 As an independent contractor, you can work whenever you want, as often as you want, and from wherever you want. You also have complete choice over which questions to answer -- pick the ones that are interesting to you. 
 Questions get posted to a central dashboard, from which you can choose to claim whichever seem most interesting to you. For each search you claim, you'll be tasked with finding 5+ links to high-quality sources, and writing a rich summary directly answering the user’s query while adding any insights you gleaned along the way. 
 QUALIFICATIONS 
 Researchers are problem solvers with a sense of imagination that helps them dig deep and find meaningful insights based on available data. Some characteristics we’re looking for: 
 
 
 A discerning eye for quality content 
 
 
 Strong general knowledge paired with several areas of expertise 
 
 
 Command of the English language and strong/grammatical writing a must 
 
 
 Ability to create lean, high-level, often quantitative summaries directly answering users’ questions
