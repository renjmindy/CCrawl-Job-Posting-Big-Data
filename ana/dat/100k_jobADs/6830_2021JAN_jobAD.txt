 The only jobs they create are snow jobs 
 From  UNION LEADER : 
 
 THE JOBS DEBATE CONTINUES. Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman's campaign is not-so-subtly firing back at Mitt Romney in a continuation of a dispute that began earlier this week over Romney's job creation record in Massachusetts. 
 Today, Huntsman's spokesman is suggesting that there was a downside to the decline in the unemployment rate during the Romney years as governor of the Bay State: the out-migration of the state's population to other states, including New Hampshire. 
 Huntsman's campaign on Tuesday accused Romney of misrepresenting his record on jobs creation as governor, noting that Massachusetts ranked 47th in the nation in that category during the Romney years of 2003 to 2007.

 The Romney campaign responded that in fact, Romney actually ‚Äúcreated nearly 50,000 jobs‚Äù as governor. 
 The Romney camp also pointed to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures that the Massachusetts unemployment rate dropped from 5.6 percent to 4.7 percent while he was governor. 
 Huntsman critics have pointed out that during his tenure as governor, Utah's unemployment rate went from 4.6 percent in December 2004 to 7.3 percent in July 2009. 
 Today, the Huntsman campaign indicated that the drop in the Massachusetts rate during Romney's term may have been skewed by the fact during the same period of declining unemployment, the Massachusetts population also declined substantially. 
 ‚Ä¶snip‚Ä¶ 
 The Los Angeles Times this week Northeastern University's Center for Labor Market Studies found that population decline was a significant contributor to the declining unemployment rate. 
 In July 2007, the director of the Northeastern center, Andrew Sum, wrote in an op-ed in The Boston Globe that during the Romney years, ‚ÄúThe decline in the state's labor force, which was influenced in large part by high levels of out-migration of working-age adults, helped hold down the official unemployment rate of the state.‚Äù 
 Sum wrote, ‚ÄúBetween July 2002 and July 2006, the US Census Bureau estimated that 222,000 more residents left Massachusetts for other states than came here to live. This high level of net domestic out-migration was equivalent to 3.5 percent of the state's population, the third highest rate of population loss in the country.‚Äù 
 In a November 2007 report, Sum and others on his team wrote, ‚ÄúFollowing the end of the jobs and economic boom in early 2001, net domestic out-migration from Massachusetts increased steadily and substantially over the following five years before moderating slightly in 2006. 
 ‚ÄúOver the July 2000 to July 2006 period, 286,000 more persons left Massachusetts to move to other states than came here from other states, an extraordinarily high level of net domestic out-migration.‚Äù

 Looks like Huntsman is doing what Pawlenty is afraid to do-press the attack on Willard the Rat Man. Nate Silver thinks that lack of aggressive branding is a problem for T-Paw and compared him to RC Cola.

 In any event, good luck to all three of these "serious" candidates should Perry enter the race. They'll need it.

 I think you're right. All he has to do is declare. Then watch the candidates drop out, starting with Newt, who is $1 million in the red already. It will come down to Perry, Bachmann, Romney, Paul, and maybe Pawlenty by the time it's decided. The contest will then be who ends up being the VP nominee, Bachmann, Romney, or Pawlenty. At least it won't be Paul! 
 As for heaven helping us, that's what the people voting for Perry will think they're doing. Too bad they'll be wrong.

 i think pawlenty will drop out pretty early, because he won't want to insult whoever will become the eventual candidate. i think bbb will drop out pretty soon after south carolina, because i don't think she'll win anything much after that. then again, she's not running for congress again, so she might stick it out as long as the money is there.

 What I don't understand is how one creates jobs if one believes in reigning in government and letting the invisible hand of the market reign supreme. Wouldn't creating jobs as Governor be socialist or Marxist or somethingist?

 There is this idea that if you tax rich corporations and individuals that they'll be out money that they would otherwise have put back into the economy. It's one of the biggest piles of bullshit ever, and a bunch of the unthinking chattel believe it. It's like Thomas Frank said a while back, "It's like the French Revolution in reverse in which the workers come pouring down the street demanding more power for the aristocracy." 
 I don't know if it's because they think that some day they too will get a slice of the American dream and at that point they won't want to pay taxes on it? The problem is, with the way things are going, the "American Dream" is on life support and the prognosis isn't good. The middle class is quickly vanishing and more of our wealth is finding it's way into the hands of a miniscule minority (as in ~90% in the hands of less than 1% of our population). You can't have that kind of wealth disparity and have a democracy. A democracy entails that your people are educated. The cost of higher education has outpaced income by many times over so that the middle class cannot even send their children to college (or must go into enormous debt to do so). There are students who get out of school who have $100k+ in student loans when the median family household income (for two adults) in this country is only ~$55k a year. And let's be honest, college is the only place that most people get any kind of real education because our public grade schools are a joke. 
 Since these rich bastards have so much money, where is it? Certainly not in our economy, because if it were, we wouldn't be in this mess. No, the rich have their money in offshore tax shelters. 
 These politicians don't care about us. They're too busy arguing over things that don't matter and refusing to do anything about the things that do. Because to do something about our economy would take money out of the mouths of their corporate masters. Heaven forbid that should happen. Children should starve to death first. 
 Best quote I've heard all year: 
"We're three weeks away from having to park our country down the street so China can't find it." -Jon Stewart

 well said, mad. last time i looked, extortion is a crime, yet the uber-rich are holding this country hostage while they sit on their piles of money until we promise them more money. i will never understand people who vote against their own interests. they're too stupid or too brainwashed to see that they're being used, and the rich don't really give a shit about them. it's all about cheap labor for the corporate masters.

 Best comment of the week: "This economy is like running all the oil out of a motor". I'm starting to get politi-overload. Must cut back on media and go outside and enjoy the mountains and trees more. Did have an epiphany the other day while repairing the hot water system out here at Raisin Ranch. After refurbishing the cabinet and door, then setting a new gas heater in place, I looked up and saw a label: Proudly made in America (with flag). Next the extra copper fill line said on package "made in USA". And the last vital element, the gas line, said right there on the polybag "made in USA"! Three things in a row made in this country? Will someone please explain this to me, I'm confused.

 How about weather (or not). Been checking the NWS late before I turn this thing off. The other night, just before daybreak in the D/FW metromess, it was 87-here it was 53. That 30 to 40 degree dif at night is a major reason I live out here now. Having 6 going on 7 months of the year unlivable outside was getting on my nerves.

 i was in vegas once, and i was shocked at the difference in temperature between day and night. it was hot as hell during the day, and at night, i couldn't put on enough clothes (ironic in vegas). here, it's hot as blazes during the day, and it's hot as blazes at night.

 Damn stats. Oh, how we hate it when they get in our way of telling the big lie. Unfortunately, the average voter won't ever know about the shell game these fools play. They're swayed by such nonsubstance. They want to vote for any Republican or Tea Party candidate just to vote against Obama.

 pish posh. they're only facts. we know that those don't bother your average rethuglican, sds. 
 i agree with you to some extent that the average people won't know. however, if the dems are smart, the campaign ads they make, if mittsie is the nominee, and i still doubt that, should be the company that made millions for mittsie by buying up companies and firing the employees. that will hit home, even with rethuglicans.

 Hey don't forget about Romney's stellar record as a job creator when he ran Bain Capitol's leverage buyouts (aka rape & pillage) here's a quote from, believe it or not, Uncle Rupie's NY Post!!! 
"the former private equity firm chief's fortune -- which has funded his political ambitions from the Massachusetts statehouse to his unsuccessful run for the White House in 2008 -- was made on the backs of companies that ultimately collapsed, putting thousands of ordinary Americans out on the street‚Ä¶.Romney's Bain invested 22 percent of the money it raised from 1987-95 in five businesses, making a $578 million profit." and of course after they collected the profits the companies went belly up -- bye bye workers, hello suckers.

ps: speaking of suckers, have you come up with an appropriate nickname for Cantor? my idea "evil cyborg spawn of Dick Cheney and Satan" is a bit unwieldy.

 i just mentioned bain (though not by name) in my reply to sds. if he's the candidate, edgy, the dems are stupid if they don't constantly portray him as the rich guy who wanted to get richer and did so by firing people's parents. they should just go with the ads from ted kennedy's campaign of years ago. they were perfect. 
 i call cantor widdle ewic, because he always acts like a 5-year-old who throws tantrums when he doesn't get his way. sometimes, i call him the token, because he's the rethuglican's proof of their big tent, because they have one jew in congress.
