 We help companies launch financial products For companies seeking to launch financial products (whether they're fintechs, larger financial services companies, or brands like Starbucks or Mercedes), finding a banking partner to work with you can be difficult. We want to change that. We are building a new type of bank, purpose-built to help our customers get their products to market quickly and painlessly. Core values Thoughtfulness. We take our time. We're not shipping a hackathon project, we're laying the foundations of the future of global financial infrastructure. It's okay if it takes a bit longer to get it up and running. Kindness and empathy. We are deliberate in using words and actions that communicate our consideration, kindness and empathy. It is not enough to assume that our intent will be positively interpreted by others - we work to make our positive intent felt. Resilience. We don't give up easily. If we're not resilient, we won't make it. So we must be patient, and we must learn from our mistakes.
