 “I do like the ease of recording time. So easy for meetings and notes. It’s a must-have app.” 
 Adam Johnston Chartered Accountant 
 Got questions? We have answers! 
 How do I switch between accounts? 
 It’s easy. Just select the hamburger icon at the top-left of the screen. From the list of available accounts, choose the one you wish to use. 
 Which devices are supported? 
 For the iOS app, you must be running iOS 12 on iPhone 5s, 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, SE, 7, 7 Plus, 8, 8 Plus, X, XR, XS, XS Max. For Android, please ensure you have Android 4.1 or later on your smartphone or tablet. 
 Can I use WorkflowMax for mobile on my iPad? 
 The iOS app is optimised for iPhone but it is fully functional on iPad. It can be found in the App Store by changing the search results filter to display 'iPhone Only' applications, rather than the 'iPad Only' default. 
 How do I go about multi-device time recordings? 
 If you are using WorkflowMax on several devices (your iPhone and laptop for example), both devices interact with the live system. This means that you may need to refresh the screen periodically on each device to see the latest data. 
 What further development can we expect? 
 We’ve got an exciting development plan in place for mobile, mainly based on your feedback. We’re planning: 
 
 Create/edit jobs/clients 
 Manage (view/create/edit) purchase orders 
 Manage (view/create/edit) quotes
