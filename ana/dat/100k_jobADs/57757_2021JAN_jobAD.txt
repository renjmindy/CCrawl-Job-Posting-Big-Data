 How can I get a job like this? 
 Check out  this story  from Civil War News about the Rev. Alan Farley, "one of the few full-time reenacting preachers and certainly the one who has been doing it the longest." 
 I didn't know there were  any  full-time reenacting preachers, but Farley's been doing it for two and a half decades. 
 During the 225th anniversary of the Battle of King's Mountain, the park hosted a whole weekend of activities. By Sunday morning, most of the crowd had trickled away, but those of us intrepid enough to turn out early got to hear an eighteenth-century backcountry sermon by an ordained minister in authentic clothing. (I'm pretty sure the guy officiating had a regular job at a twenty-first century church.) It was a real treat, and if you're ever at an event that has something like this, I recommend it. 
 My only question is, if reenacting preachers are full-time, then why do the soldiers have to go back to work on Mondays?
