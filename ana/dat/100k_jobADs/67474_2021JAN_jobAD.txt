 A Tool For The Job 
 My dad told me a long time ago that the people that fix things are the ones with the right tools. We admire the people that we call "mechanically inclined", but don't recognize the importance of the proper tools they use. It is false to think that just because you put the proper tool in someone's hand the job will get done. However, without the proper tool it is hard for even the most mechanically inclined people to complete their mission. What we find is that the people who fix things also take pride in the tools that they have for each problem they may face. 
 I was in a quandary. The distance of the golf hole was 180 yards. It was an in between distance I thought from the clubs I normally used. In the bag however was a 4 wood that I rarely swung. "Why not try that club?", I thought. Amazingly the ball went beautifully toward the green landing a few feet short and rolling right up on the green! 
 
 As I put the club back in the bag I said out loud "that was just the right tool for the job!" My retired friend who was playing with me that day agreed. I don't play golf very much but I have to admit that I have too many clubs in the bag. Some of these are specialty clubs that you may need in a particular situation. The problem is that I don't practice with these clubs enough and when that situation comes up I'm liable to miss-hit the ball with it. The other problem is digging the right club out of the bag at just the right time. The third problem is that carrying all of the situational clubs can make for one heavy bag. After hearing how heavy my bag was a former neighbor told me that I should pick out only the clubs I use the best and take the other ones out of the bag. Years ago I played golf with another guy whose idea struck me as very funny. Instead of using all of his clubs in his bag he was hitting every shot with his 3-wood. It seems that he liked that particular club and used it to excess. Somewhere there has to be a middle ground to these two approaches. 
 
 My dad had a tool box and tried to keep his tools organized. He had his wrenches all tied together so he could find the right one in a moments notice. I too have a tool box but I hate to admit the number of times a particular job comes up and I can't find the right tool. It isn't because I don't have the tool. It is more a case of not needing it and when I do having a hard time finding it. This comes about when the tool is used and it doesn't get back in it's proper place. It's a simple exercise that often gets missed. Having your tools ready for the next use is as important as using the tool you need in the present. It reminds me of how some companies treat their customers. Instead of a long term relationship they are only concerned with what they can sell them right now. To relieve this problem companies now put their customers in their data base so that they have a history of their visits on their books. Having a long term approach always keeps customers in the pipeline. Treating customers the right way brings them back. Putting your tools in the proper place insures they are there when you need them the next time. 
   
 I was searching for essential tools for the toolbox. One website gave me twelve. In no particular order here they are: 
 A Claw Hammer  -Can be used for demolition jobs and pounding in nails. The claw can pull misguided nails out and also straighten it's path. 
 Flathead Screwdriver  -Enough Flathead screws still exist to need one and it can also be improvised for other jobs such as prying or scraping 
 Phillips Screwdriver  -Invented in 1936 by Henry F. Phillips, the Phillips Head Screw has basically replaced Flat Head Screws 
 A Tape Measure  -Remember the old saying "measure twice and cut once." A tape measure is an essential tool. 
 A Crescent Wrench  - The beauty of this wrench is that it is adjustable to handle many different jobs 
 A Socket Wrench  - Using the ratcheting technique without having to re-grip is great when working on big projects 
 Vice Grip Locking Pliers  -When you need an extra hand these can lock something into place. They are a very versatile tool that can be used as a pipe wrench, pliers, wire cutters, a ratchet, or a clamp 
 Needle Nose Pliers  -An essential electrician tool it allows you to hold small items in place 
 Cordless Drill and Bits  -How nice it is to drill holes without cords or the old fashioned non-electric drill. Reversing the direction makes taking screws out so easy. 
 Crosscut Saw  -For all of your tree trimming needs 
 Level  -Essential to most projects to make sure the finished work is in a straight line 
 Utility Knife  -Every project seems to provide things to cut and scrape 
 Isn't it ironic that these twelve basic tools was also the same number that Jesus chose to be his Disciples? He chose the original twelve to spread the Gospel throughout the earth. In the same way he wants to use us for his purposes in our day. There are never too many clubs in God's bag. He is able to take whoever is willing and use that person in a special way to reach others! Sometimes we wrongly feel that our gift is not special. God looks at the gifts he has bestowed on us as very special! He specifically made us all for his special purposes. When he needs that special gift does he find us where we should be? Sadly too many are not ready when the master calls. We find ourselves out of the box, lost, or feeling unneeded. His or her tools provide comfort for the carpenter. Like going to the toolbox to find the perfect tool for the job, God looks for us to meet his purpose too! Preparing for a job to get done he is confident that we can be successful through him. When he reaches for an extension of his hand he wants to be able to count on us. Will he find a willing heart when the master craftsman needs to use us in showing his glory to a dying world?
