 Your mission statement 
 Posted on  May 9, 2020  by  successencourager 
 When I find myself struggling with which goal to focus on, how to start a particular task, or if I'm just unsure about my current or distant future/focus I review my mission statement. Sometimes that review is enough to put me back on track while other times I edit it a bit to connect with how I have evolved or adapted. The core of a mission statement stays the same though - since it is based on personal core values and authenticity. 
 A personal mission statement not only helps create and accomplish goals, it is a reminder to focus on the future you want in a brief summary. Your personal mission statement describes what success personally means to you. It summarizes where you want to be in the future, encompasses your values, and help you set goals. Everyone’s statement should be unique to them. 
 Each statement is based on personal unique core values & goals, but also aligns with career & professional growth. Your statement helps you bridge your personal & professional development. 
 You can create such a statement through a few questions and self-discovery. This process will help you prioritize the most important goals. Once you have a personal mission statement you can define your goal list. 
 You can create a personal mission statement by asking yourself: (try to answer the questions with the first thought(s) that come to mind, this shouldn't be stressful. If you aren't sure how to answer one or it doesn't connect with you, skip it…you don't have to answer them all!). 
 
 What is important to me? This question can be answered with a list of personal core values or a summary. 
 What do I want to accomplish? Create a brief outline or short list of goals. 
 What skills and experience do I currently have? How do these current skills tie into my goals & core values? 
 What skills do I need to learn to accomplish my future goals? 
 What makes me unique? What competencies/personal traits help me succeed at my goals? 
 Do my goals include assistance and/or knowledge from others? How can I connect with those team members? 
 
 Once you have answers to a few or all of the questions above you can start to piece together a statement by combining the words that mean the most to you and create your unique personal mission statement. 
 After a lot of drafts, I came up with my own personal mission statement: 
 _To encourage others to set goals & succeed, share my professional and personal knowledge while being creative through my pas_sio  n for writing . 
 Other mission statement examples: 
 
 “To be a teacher. And to be known for inspiring my students to be more than they thought they could be.” - Oprah Winfrey's personal statement 
 “To have fun in my journey through life and learn from my mistakes.” - Sir Richard Branson's personal statement 
 “Making the best possible ice cream, in the nicest possible way." Ben & Jerry's mission statement 
 
 A personal mission statement can help you create or revamp your resume or career search, focus on education/training path, and/or discover and set realistic unique goals for your health, creativity, relationships, & other areas of your personal and professional life. When setting goals ask yourself how that particular goal is connected to your mission statement. 
 What is your personal mission statement? What goal(s) do you want to focus on and accomplish?
