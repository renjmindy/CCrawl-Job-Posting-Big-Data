 WOOLWORTH'S DAY 
 
 http://youtu.be/odVLONPB300 
 I landed my first job as secretary for the Sr. Vice President of American Savings & Loan here in Wichita. The people were nice and the work was fun. There were no computers yet, so we worked on reports on our old-fashioned typewriters. Back then they seemed quite modern though. The Selectric II had the little _ "type ball",_ or  " golf ball"  with the characters on it - and the ability to backspace and correct. No more typing erasers - we could erase with the touch of a button!

 My parents told me, "Finish your dinner. People in China and India are starving." I tell my daughters, "Finish your homework. People in India and China are starving for your job." - Thomas L. Friedman 
 
 I called it a "type ball" & my boss called it a "golf ball" 
 
 Nostalgia is like a grammar lesson: you find the present tense, but the past perfect! - Owens Lee Pomeroy 
 
 The bank was at 3rd and Main in downtown Wichita. Lunch was a big deal for the secretaries and the Woolworth lunch counter was a favorite! We walked to lunch when the weather was nice. I remember how good it felt to get out and walk after being cooped up inside all morning. Woolworth's was in the 200 block of Douglas, so we didn't have far to go. 
 
 Woolworth's had an old-fashioned feel to it, probably because it had been there for such a long time! They had one of those little photo booths where you and maybe one other person could snuggle up and get a photo taken for a dime. The lunch counter was quaint like an old-time soda fountain - again, because that's what it was. My favorite for lunch was the taco salad. They made a terrific taco salad! 
 
 It's never safe to be nostalgic about something until you're absolutely certain there's no chance of its coming back. - Bill Vaughn 
 
 Maybe that taco salad tasted so much better because I knew I was making the money that paid for it. It gives comfort to a soul to know they are self-supporting and able to earn a comfortable living, earn the respect of co-workers, earn the right to enjoy life and be happy. 
 
 Nostalgia for what we have lost is more bearable than nostalgia for what we have never had, for the first involves knowledge and pleasure, the second only ignorance and pain. - Mignon McLaughlin,  The Neurotic 's Notebook , 1960 
 
 God has been so good to me through the years!  I have some very good memories, and I 'll always remember the lunches we enjoyed at the Woolworth lunch counter!  ðŸ™‚
