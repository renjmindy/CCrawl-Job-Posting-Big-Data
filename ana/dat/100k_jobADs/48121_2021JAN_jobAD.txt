 Mimica We're building the future of work automation. At Mimica we are developing a new paradigm for automation: our software learns to automate work just by observing it. This eliminates the need for developers, making the benefits of automation accessible to everyone. Automation Today The state-of-the-art of software automation requires explicit programming by a developer. Tools that make this programming easier have gained popularity, but the paradigm is essentially the same: a human must program an automation step-by-step. This intricate, manual programming is time-consuming and error-prone, making automation prohibitively expensive for most of the world's businesses. Mimica's Approach Our machine learning algorithms learn to automate work by continuously observing clicks and keystrokes and identifying repetition within this dataset. Once we understand a process, we can generate code for the automation. This approach dramatically broadens automation potential within a business. With Mimica, all of the low-volume, bespoke tasks that never warranted attention suddenly become viable candidates for automation.
