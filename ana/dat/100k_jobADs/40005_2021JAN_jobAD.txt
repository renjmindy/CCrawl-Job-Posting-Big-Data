 The Future 
 October 2, 2015October 2, 2015   Jai Vyas 23 Comments 
 
 Today is the 2nd of October. Its celebrated as Gandhi Jayanti, here in India, and I hope, in the rest of the world as well. The 'father of our nation' as he's called, Mahatma Gandhi, was born on this day 146 years ago. 
 Its a day usually involving looking back at his life, how he voyaged, along with the rest of India, through the troughs and peaks of the freedom struggle. Its a day usually involving a fair bit of reminiscing. 
 But let's not do that. Let's instead look forward. Let's look to the future. I'd like to look to the future instead. 
 What does the future hold for me? What would I be like, what would my life be like 5, 10, 15, 20 years from now? 
 I honestly don't have a damn clue. 
 You know how they say that its not good living in the past? Well, I believe its not good to look too far into the future as well. Just as there is no point in thinking too much about what has been, there is no point in dwelling too much on what, possibly, probably, is still to come. Sometimes you just have to take a leap of faith and promise yourself you'll get where you want to be, no matter what. No. Matter. What. 
 I am in one of those phases right now when I don't know whether I should be enthusiastic about my future or not. I know what I want to be, and I have a very rough idea of how I can go about it, but I am honestly not sure about it all at the moment. 
 For me, the next three to four months are the most crucial months of my junior college life so far. I have my terminals towards the end of this month (for which I'm obviously not yet prepared completely), prelims (preliminary is the full form; they're basically like mock tests before our final 12th Board Exams), and then the 12th Boards in late February, and will stretch up to late March. After that I have a couple of months off, not to figure out what I want to do next, that is kinda a little late, but just to take a breather before I plunge back into the fray. 
 After the next decade or so, I aim to see myself having a profession, of some kind, in the field of Psychology. Of course, writing will be my side-business, so don't you people worry about me ever stopping writing ðŸ˜€ I have been doing some research regarding careers in Psychology and Sports Psychology has interested me a lot. Other branches of Psychology that interest me are Criminal Psychology and Couneselling/Therapy. Are any of my readers here Psychologists, or do you have knowledge about that field? I'd love some advice or anything you have that could help in any way. 
 
 That was me contemplating about the past, present and future. What do you look forward to?

 A Rare Breed 
 August 4, 2015August 4, 2015   Jai Vyas 6 Comments 
 
 During the latter stages of school and for most of college, complaining how bad your teachers are, is pretty commonplace among student circles. At least that's the way it is here. And its no different with my friends, and friends of friends, and the friends-so-distant-you-don't-even-know-they're-the-least-bit-related, and the people I overhear complaining about the teachers. But occasionally, that too if you're lucky, there comes a teacher who you just cannot nitpick about. And its not just the teaching part that she's so good at, but also the being-a-likeable-human-being part. Remember how I said 'if you're lucky'? 
 Well, here's what happened. I switched subjects this year (I'm in the 12th Grade, or the second year of Junior College), from Mathematics to Philosophy. I had taken Math in the 11th owing to some general advice of a school teacher and also an administrative misdirection by a college official, and Math didn't work out for me. In the meantime I had also decided that I wanted to pursue Psychology as a career (still working out the details, doing some research). Since I didn't want to continue with Math, the obvious choice was Philosophy as opposed to the third option of History, since not only is Philosophy an immensely interesting subject to me, personally, but it is also a good subject to have a background in if you want to pursue Psychology. 
 Now, the procedure for switching subjects like this was no doubt a lengthy one. I started inquiring about it towards the end of my 11th and the process dragged on all through my pre-12th vacations and well into the second month of 12th until any official announcement came from the college. So right until it got wrapped up, from my point of view I had a very realistic chance of 50-50 of having Philosophy as a subject to study. When it did get wrapped up, it was a relief like no other I've felt in recent times. But that's not the point of this post. 
 The teacher I've got for Philosophy is, in short, pretty much awesome. There's different kinds of awesome when it comes to teachers, and it depends on what kind of student you are. If you're the kind that likes the subject to be stimulating, something that makes you think, genuinely be drawn to the subject in a natural, progressive way, then awesome would mean a teacher that explains the subject very well, makes lectures not seem like lectures, makes them interactive, doesn't stick to the text, and does not give you everything on a silver platter. That's the kind of teacher I've got. Not only that, but she also takes interest in every student, she knows a lot of our names, and comes off to me as a very pragmatic but passionate person. 
 About a week or so back I had to go pay a small amount of money to the college as administrative fees for carrying out the whole subject change process. But the time they'd allotted for us to pay the money fell smack in between our Philosophy lecture of the day so I missed about half an hour of it. I thought I'd still go and try to explain why I was late. When I got there, to my surprise, the classroom was completely empty and our teacher was sitting by the table on the podium, reading something. She was still expecting people to turn up, because as soon as I walked in she asked me if I knew where the others were. These kind of things happen sometimes, everybody decides to bunk the lecture on the same day, knowingly or otherwise is something I won't comment on ;). 
 Anyhoo, since I was there, she asked me whether my subject change process had come to a close so I could finally concentrate on Philosophy, and I told her that it was done now that I had paid the money. She looked genuinely relieved, and for a second, almost as much as I was. I'm usually a talkative person if I feel comfortable in the company I am and such teachers usually are that way, so we talked about this and that for a few minutes. Naturally, as a teacher she asked me what my plans were, academically, after I passed the 12th Grade. I told her I was pretty dead set on Psychology but was still considering the exact options I had in that field and had it narrowed down to Counselling, Sports and Criminal Psychology. She expressed surprise at the fact that I was so sure 'so early'. The fact that I have a blog also came up. She was even more surprised, in a good way. During her lecture a couple of days back she had told us she was quite into fiction, especially the Agatha Christie kind, so there was more surprise for store in her when I told her I had started the blog primarily for the purpose of fiction, the Agatha Christie kind. She told me she was very impressed, and that made me feel really good. Like I was on the right track, more or less. The fact that I was from a reputed school and a reputed education Board, and had done well there, made her even more impressed. Then I realised I may have set the bar too high for my own sake because she told me she expected me to score at least a 95% in my 12th Board exam.  sigh 
 Guess I'll just have to get down to the books now. 
 See on the other side, folks!
