 Experience in building large-scale web applications in a fast-moving team environment. 
 Strong experience with relational databases and SQL (we use PostgreSQL). 
 Strong experience building reliable and scalable APIs from the ground up that serve web/mobile applications, alerting & health systems, or third party integrations. This includes designing API abstractions and implementing core API concepts such as authentication. 
 A generalist background and the ability to ‚Äúgo deep‚Äù anywhere in the stack 
 Pride for the work you do and care deeply about the products which consume your services 
 Strong appreciation for good design. 
 Smarts, humility, communication skills, and equal willingness to teach and learn. 
 Desire to shape our engineering culture by coming up with ideas, tools, and infrastructure wherever you see a problem to be solved. 
 
 Bonus Points For 
 
 Demonstrated work beyond the back-end, experienced in creating front-end interfaces or architecting server infrastructure. 
 Experience with GraphQL. 
 Built, documented, and monitored a Public API platform. 
 You maintain or contribute to an open source project. 
 
 Open to long-term contractors
