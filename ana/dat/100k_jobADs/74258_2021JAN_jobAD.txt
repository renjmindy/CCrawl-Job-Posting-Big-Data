 Our software learns to automate work just by observing it 
 Role overview 
 We are looking for exceptional individuals to join our software engineering team at Mimica. Mimica helps businesses automate repetitive computer-based work. We take a unique approach to automation: rather than being explicitly programmed, our software learns to execute tasks through human observation. Our software makes automation effortless--- it records clicks and keystrokes, identifies simple, repetitive tasks, and automates them. This approach dramatically broadens automation potential within a business. With Mimica, all of the low-volume, bespoke tasks that never warranted attention suddenly become viable candidates for automation, opening up a $5T previously untapped market. 
 We currently sell to large enterprises like  Citi  ,  Dell  ,  Uber  and  Deloitte  , and weâ€™re backed by two of Europeâ€™s most successful early-stage investors,  Entrepreneur First  and  Episode 1.  Weâ€™re now on the cusp of closing a  Â£10M Series A  financing, and growing our team from 12 to 30. 
 Weâ€™re looking for individuals ready to work collaboratively and move quickly. Youâ€™ll join a small, ambitious team with diverse backgrounds in neuroscience, computational biology, software engineering, and machine learning. We are passionate about solving difficult technical challenges and always seek to improve on existing solutions. Your work here will have a strong, tangible impact on the whole company. 
 Our first product is a web application, built in React on Node. As a  software engineer  you will architect, develop, test, and maintain software for this product, creating an experience that delights our users. This means identifying and prioritizing features, designing a scalable architecture, and writing front-end and back-end code. Finally you'll ship your code to production environments. 
 Past experience 
 
 5+ years software development experience

 Experience with technologies like  React  /  Node  Qualities 
 You think like a founder: you can make decisions quickly with little oversight; you keep the big picture in mind; you take responsibility and initiative for constantly improving your product; other people look to you for solutions amid uncertainty. 
 You are a team player: you instinctively seek and give feedback; you are not afraid to be wrong or challenged. You enjoy working collaboratively to find the best solution. 
 You are an exceptional worker: the job isnâ€™t done until your high standards are met. You donâ€™t cut corners, nor do you always seek perfection; you balance the need for quality and speed. 
 You are an independent thinker: you are unafraid of challenging the status quo; you bring a contrarian mindset to the table when evaluating decisions. 
 You are strategically-minded: you are able to identify and prioritize strategic initiatives and are eager to think big about Mimicaâ€™s potential. 
 You are obsessed with the user: you live and breathe user experience and continuously improve your understanding of how and why people use your product. You have an eye for design and an intuition for what separates good software from great. 
 You have a desire to change the future of work If this sounds like you, we would love to hear from you. 
 
 We have a friendly, down-to-earth, diverse, inclusive team who are excited and eager to build a company together. Team members are compensated well with both salary and equity.

 Mimica We're building the future of work automation. At Mimica we are developing a new paradigm for automation: our software learns to automate work just by observing it. This eliminates the need for developers, making the benefits of automation accessible to everyone. Automation Today The state-of-the-art of software automation requires explicit programming by a developer. Tools that make this programming easier have gained popularity, but the paradigm is essentially the same: a human must program an automation step-by-step. This intricate, manual programming is time-consuming and error-prone, making automation prohibitively expensive for most of the world's businesses. Mimica's Approach Our machine learning algorithms learn to automate work by continuously observing clicks and keystrokes and identifying repetition within this dataset. Once we understand a process, we can generate code for the automation. This approach dramatically broadens automation potential within a business. With Mimica, all of the low-volume, bespoke tasks that never warranted attention suddenly become viable candidates for automation.
