 Addressing stories with a Millennial Perspective 
 Tag: Career 
 Education Proclamation 
 Posted on  September 12, 2012September 12, 2012  by  themillennialperspective 
 
 People often talk about how hard school is, or how hard learning is. Well, I'd like to respectfully disagree. Not only for the obvious point that if you do what you like, anything is fun and easy, but I will delve more into what it makes easier, and how the only thing is doesn't help, particularly in British Columbia, is the wallet. 
 Post Secondary leads to a better life. This is a broad statement, but what I refer to is the fact that it opens up opportunities, MANY opportunities just by having a diploma. It shows employers that you are more trainable than others in that you can pick up a skill quickly after being briefly taught. This is a skill many don't have, even some that DO have post secondary education, however, it does significantly help with applying places. Not just jobs either, careers. Never again will you have to work a 9 to 5 if you chose not to. School allows you freedom to chose a field that better suits your sleeping patterns, work preferences, etc. again, simply by having that little magical slip of paper. 
 
 Post secondary helps you meet new people. I can't tell you how many new people I have met through school, many being new friends, friend I am sure I will keep for the rest of my life. Friends that will go on to do great things as well. Friends I will work with in the future. Friends that can introduce me to even more friends that strive towards the same distant, yet, attainable goal. A wise man once said life is like a box of chocolates, and what is a box of chocolates with only one chocolate in it? 
 
 LEARNING in general increases intellect if you're doing it right. Chances are if you're reading my blog and keeping up to date with it your intellect has improved (haha). But if you're watching Jersey Shore and reading Snooki's book while following tabloids on the side, chances are you are REDUCING your intellect. 
 
 Personally through my experience in advancing my English skills, I have gained a broad sense of our language, and have adapted an outstanding vocabulary. Friends of mine are often shocked at my ability to use words, and that I don't always use big words when they find out just how extensive my vocabulary is. However, I don't type like it often because I do not speak like it. In today's day and age, most people have a very minute knowledge base of their own language, and that's okay (well not really, but whatever). It's my job as a writer to acknowledge this fact and bend my own words so everyone understands. However, my point can be summed up easily. I don't know how many times I've avoided sounding like a jerk by saying someone lacks intellect, rather than saying they are stupid. This is because if I say someone lacks intellect, most people won't know what it means, and the ones that do will still take a few moments to think about it, giving me enough time to run for the hills in case they throw the first punch. 
 
 All in all, education is the best thing we can do for ourselves, or if we are lucky, the best gift our parents can give us. I consider myself lucky to live in a country that allows such educational opportunities and a world of freedom once my eyes fully open. And ultimately, the tuition and textbooks can be next to nothing in the grand scheme of things. To end things off, I will quote another movie, my favorite movie, in saying: You know, if you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything. 
 So go out, get educated, avoid tabloids, and have fun. You only get one chance to prove you've got IT.
