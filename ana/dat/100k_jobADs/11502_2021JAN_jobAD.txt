 AND Introduction 
 At AND, we accelerate the development of digital capabilities. In practice, that means helping ambitious leaders and organisations build the teams, products, processes and even operational structures they need to close the digital skills gap within their organisation today, so that they thrive tomorrow. 
 Clients rely on our experience, agility and craft skills across tech and business strategy, software development and product management to address some of the toughest challenges facing their businesses. 
 We bring aboard thinkers, tinkerers, passionate software craftspeople and inspiring technologists to help us solve these challenges. Together, we’re united by a sense of pragmatism, purpose and a deeply-held belief that digital products and technology alone won’t transform a business or save the world: it’s the people that count. 
 About You 
 As our Communications Lead, you will be focused on creating and scaling well-aligned, high quality PR and communications opportunities for AND - supporting our growth by ensuring that AND is visible and positively remarked upon by key target audiences. 
 You’ll work closely with the Head of Marketing, Campaign Manager, Digital Marketing Specialist and In-House Storyteller to ideate, clearly define and distribute priority communications that support marketing objectives. 
 
 Develop and own a clear PR and media strategy for AND to increase brand visibility and awareness, including the implementation of a dashboard and reporting to track and measure PR outcomes. 
 Manage the relationship with AND Digital’s external PR agency, providing timely leadership and direction to ensure we achieve excellent coverage. 
 Identify media opportunities and secure coverage for AND Digital in all types of media, including broadcast, print and digital channels. 
 Identify opportunities to complement and amplify earned coverage with effective paid opportunities. 
 Research and own an awards calendar for AND, submitting entries and managing ANDi contributions where necessary. 
 Help identify, craft and support media opportunities and speaking engagements for our team of in-house experts. 
 Be a proactive, timely and approachable central point of contact for the management and response of any sensitive or critical communications that may impact AND’s reputation. 
 Craft pitches, interview briefing sheets and other media collateral as required. 
 Work closely to support the In-house Storyteller on the development of clear tone of voice guidelines. 
 
 To do that, it 's essential you bring the following: 
 
 5+ years PR and media experience, preferably with a strong background in technology and/or B2B professional services. 
 An exceptional writer - a real stickler for quality with strong attention to detail. 
 A bachelor’s degree in English, journalism or a communications-related discipline preferred. 
 A keen instinct for recognising pitching angles that aren’t immediately obvious, as well as knowing which reporters should be included on a pitch media list. 
 Experience and expertise in leveraging PR to support both brand building and lead generation objectives. 
 Strong operational and execution focus, with plenty of hustle whilst maintaining the ability to see the bigger picture, or the broader story. 
 
 It’s helpful if you also have: 
 
 Significant experience in change management and building PR from early stages of maturity. 
 Comfortable working in a fast-paced, fast-growth environment with a high degree of accountability and autonomy. 
 Experience of fostering and building positive, integrated relationships with multiple stakeholders to source and create compelling stories for external audiences. 
 
 Joining AND 
 From the work we deliver, to the way we serve and support our people, we work hard to ensure that there’s nowhere quite like AND. But joining a company is a two-way street: the fit has to work on both sides. So before you apply, here’s three key things to understand about us: 
 
 We’re built for people - like, real humans. Not ‘resources’ or ‘staff’. That means happiness and wellbeing really do matter to us, and we hate unnecessary hierarchy and bureaucracy. 
 There’s no well-trodden path ahead: AND is growing fast and forging a new trail. That’s exciting, and gives us all the autonomy and opportunity we love - but bear in mind it also demands focus, patience and resilience. 
 Diversity is a priority. After all, to build great products that a wide variety of different people love to use, we need a wide variety of people to help us build them. So diversity is more than a policy or a word: it’s business critical for us. 
 
 Still sound good? Great! Fill out the short application form below and we’ll be in touch.
