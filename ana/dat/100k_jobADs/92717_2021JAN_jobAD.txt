 The traditional work environment involves communicating with your coworkers and clients almost on a daily basis; apart from sitting in front of your computer for long hours, it is a norm that you physically come to work, go to your desk, attend a meeting or two, talk to your colleagues face-to-face, look them in the eye, send emails, answer phone calls, and the list goes on. This typical workday may seem a normal one for some, but this kind of day may drown workers who tend to be introverted. 
 ‎ 
 Introverted Workers 
 Aside from juggling many different tasks to accomplish in a day, the interaction among people with several personalities add to the struggle of introverted employees; this makes it double the struggle to meet deadlines and submit reports and whatnots. It is not just they hate people, introverted workers thrive on working at their own pace in their own bubble. Some find it tiring to have even the slightest human interaction; they prefer dealing with issues or tasks at work in any way but face-to-face interaction. 
 ‎ 
 The challenge isn’t only for introverted workers but for their colleagues as well. Some workers enjoy and succeed in harmoniously working with other people; working with an introvert can be a struggle for them as well, and vice versa. It’s a good thing that the working conditions have also evolved, and jobs requiring little to no face-to-face interaction among colleagues a.k.a “careers for people that hate people” are available in the market. 
 ‎ 
 1. Video Editor 
 With the continuous rise of social media usage, more and more people have left their marks on the world wide web. Many of these personalities start their own Youtube channels. If you aren’t quite confident in talking to the camera, perhaps working behind the scenes as a video editor is a job for you. 
 ‎ 
 ‎ 
 As a video editor, you must be knowledgeable in handling different video editing software. Having a degree is a plus, but not always a requirement. As long as you have the skills and the passion to put together footage into meaningful worth-watching videos, then you can try video editing. 
 ‎ 
 3. Translator 
 If you have taken a semester or two studying a different language and thought it would only be useful when traveling, well, think again and prepare to thank your university self as you can get a job as a translator with this learned skill. Being a translator leaves little to no interaction with other people. You can do the job by yourself, and only accept the job that you have full confidence in. 
 ‎ 
 Some companies outsource translating jobs rather than having their own in-house translator. A background, or sometimes even certification is needed in this kind of job, so make sure you have brushed up on your language skills for this. 
 ‎ 
 3. Freelance Writer 
 Weaving words to form meaningful sentences is not an easy feat to have, but if you are gifted with this skill then perhaps writing is for you. From light-themed articles to formal writing, there are several companies and individuals looking for writers. There is an array of niches available like fashion, beauty, health, finance, and even real-estate to name a few; you can take writing jobs that interest you the most. Building your list of clients will come naturally as long as you meet the deadlines and deliver quality output. 
 ‎‎ 
 4. Virtual Assistant 
 If you are keen on organizing one’s programs and schedule, perhaps this is the job for you. With the current situation we are in, this industry has certainly gained more popularity. You can take different jobs from data entry, customer service to social media management. Virtual assistant jobs are one of the most demanded jobs by different businesses, especially small and mid-sized businesses. A job of a virtual assistant includes scheduling content, setting appointments, making phone calls and travel arrangements, and with the rise of social media, social media management as well. Having additional skills like photo editing or graphic design will also come in handy if you plan on becoming a virtual assistant. 
 ‎‎ 
 5. Proofreader 
 If you have an excellent eye for detail, then why not try your hand at proofreading? It’s one thing to express thoughts and feelings in words, but it is another to make sure the message is delivered across well, and without any mistakes. 
 ‎ 
 ‎ 
 As a proofreader, you are in charge of checking each sentence or line on a book or website to be grammatical, and free from typographical issues, or spelling mistakes. This is one of the best jobs to be done alone as you do not need to rely on others to finish the task. Your communication with your client is mostly to be done online through the exchange of emails. 
 ‎ 
 6. Blogger 
 Some are confident in expressing themselves in front of the camera or many people, but for introverted workers, this can be highly stressful. Being a blogger is one of the jobs that don’t deal with people. As a blogger, you express your thoughts through written words. There is no need to face other people to earn. Enticing website layouts, worth-reading articles, and clear photos are just some of the things you must take into consideration when starting in this industry. A blogger earns through different means like sponsored content and ads to name a few. One post can rack up to thousands of dollars of income, but one must know that this job requires time to earn more. 
 ‎ 
 7. Online Tutor 
 Despite the interaction you have through the screen, online teaching isn’t as bad as face-face interaction so it is still a good job for someone who hates people. More often, students will be kids from kindergarten to grade school. If video calls still make you feel uncomfortable, there are different platforms that offer phone classes only. You conduct a 10 to 15 minutes class all though just a call. 
 ‎ 
 This list is not only useful for introverted workers but workers who have been feeling out of it lately. The pandemic has put a halt on a lot of plans and put a weight on each worker’s shoulders. If you feel like work is getting the best of you, try taking this  test  as you might be experiencing burnout. It’s best to find out early, so you can address it properly as soon as possible to avoid any severe effects.
