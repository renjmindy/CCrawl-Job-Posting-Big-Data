 Worksource Montgomery  |  Career Support  |  What We Offer 
 There are a lot of opportunities out there and we want to help you find the right one!  WorkSource Montgomery American Job Centers’ expert staff and H.I.R.E. Specialists can share proven tips on how to achieve success in your job search. We can provide knowledge on the types of jobs that are growing and sustainable, how to prepare for them, and connections and events to help you obtain them. A first step in achieving success is to register with the  Maryland Workforce Exchange  so you can connect with employers and job opportunities as well as register for upcoming employment fairs, recruitment and hiring events.

 H.I.R.E. Services 
 The  Helping Individuals Reach Employment (H.I.R.E)  Program was launched by WorkSource Montgomery in 2018 to better serve job seekers in their communities. We understand that there are various needs and barriers to reach sustainable employment and not every job seeker can access our American Job Centers in Wheaton and Germantown, so we offer H.I.R.E. (pop-up) services in various  Montgomery County Public Libraries (MCPL)  locations and communities to broaden our reach and raise awareness of WSM’s mission. 
 H.I.R.E. services do not require an appointment - walk-ins are always welcome. During an initial meeting, a career specialist works with customers one-on-one to identify their immediate employment needs, eligibility for federal assistance, and barriers to employment. If a customer’s need requires attention beyond one session or appointment, they are introduced to other WSM services or referred to one of our workforce partners. 
 Services vary depending on the employment needs of the immediate community. Specialists are expertly trained to work with customers of varying backgrounds, understand industry workforce trends, and know what skills are in demand so that they can tailor services offered depending on the location. 
 In general,  H.I.R.E. services include: 
 
 Registration on the  Maryland Workforce Exchange 
 Resume assistance 
 Identifying skills and talents 
 Advisement on interview techniques 
 Connection to other job search resources
