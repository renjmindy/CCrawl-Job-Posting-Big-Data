 Literature Review 
 As part of our initiative focused on Barriers for Job Seekers, we completed a literature review in hopes of developing a deeper understanding of what barriers were indicated by research. Our research was targeted on four populations: newcomers, persons who are underemployed, recent graduates and persons on Ontario Works. Below are some of the highlights of our findings. 
 The following barriers to employment were experienced by all four populations: 
 
 Lack of work experience 
 Lack of educational qualifications 
 Transportation 
 Employer biases/stigmas 
 Mental Health 
 
 Newcomers may face some of the following barriers: 
 
 Having limited to access to settlement services before arrival 
 Few newcomers accessing services to assist in settlement. Many rely on the personal connections they’ve established with people they can trust. 
 Overqualified for work and a lack of credential recognition 
 Language skills 
 
 Additionally, refugees may face some of the following barriers: 
 
 Language Barrier 
 Settlement services can take time away from job seeking 
 Cannot access financial services with refugee status 
 Cannot gain a driver’s license 
 Difficulty to validate experiences and credentials due to a loss of records in their home countries 
 Limited time for language classes, house hunting and job seeking 
 Overwhelming experiences for youth who often act as the head of the household 
 
 Recent Graduates may encounter some of the following barriers: 
 
 Lack of work experience 
 Part time resulting in underemployment 
 Lack of coordinated labour market information between jurisdictions and educational institutions 
 Lack of employee willingness to train young/new workers 
 Lack of networking skills 
 
 Persons in receipt of Ontario Works may face some of the following barriers: 
 
 Lack of transportation which affects access to services and available jobs 
 Loss of drug and dental benefits after leaving assistance if not provided by job 
 Lack of childcare services 
 Underemployment
