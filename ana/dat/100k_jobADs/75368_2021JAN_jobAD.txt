 <- The Next Rant… When your local association isn't what it should be. 
 Where Have the Days Gone?? -> 
 There's One At Every Job 
 Posted on  May 9, 2013  by   LostMedic 
 Well today officially ruined every love for the new job! I just can't escape bitches!! It's wearing me down! 
 So I had several days of orientation at the new job and all was going great! Loved the people, they have been wonderful to us! Almost ALL of the equipment is stuff I have/do use and apparently that is the problem. 
 I found out today that an employee was complaining to several people and said I'm a "snobby, know it all". Why did she say this?? Well she showed us the equipment on the trucks and kept asking, "Has anyone used this before?" Well…I have…on every single thing she showed us. Honestly, I have used it all…so that makes me a snobby, know it all. Was I suppose to lie?! I mean she asked…it's not my fault I've been trained on it and use it already. 
 I found out she has been a problem in the past and my fellow new hire doesn't care for her. There has been talk of "problem employees" and to stay away from them…well I know one of them now. I will never say a work to or in front of her again…ever. 
 It just pisses me off! Fucking woman!! EMS is the worse! They are so fucking territorial and get pissy and downright evil when other woman get hired on. Well now we all know who one of them is…

 Yeah they may be. But you don't have to be. Rise above, take a deep breath, and maybe theyll learn respect

 I'm just going to stay as far away from her as possible.
