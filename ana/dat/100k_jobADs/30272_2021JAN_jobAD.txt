 2018 East County Job Fair 
 Last week’s East County Job Fair was a reflection of the hard work of county leaders and organizations that came together with dedicated volunteers to bring something truly meaningful to the community. This event was organized in partnership with Congressman John Sarbanes, County Executive Ike Leggett, Senator Craig Zucker, Delegates Anne Kaiser, Eric Luedtke, and Pan Queen, Councilmember Tom Hucker, East County Regional Service Center, Montgomery County Recreation, Montgomery County Commission for Women and WorkSource Montgomery. It provided substantive interactions with businesses to help individuals on their path to attaining their career goals and we hope it will continue to bring tangible growth, employment, and networking opportunities in the future. 
 More than 600 job seekers registered to attend the fair and more than 65 employers. During this 4-hour event, County residents from a wide variety of backgrounds met with employers that ranged from small businesses to local, state, and federal government agencies. Career seekers and entrepreneurs also participated in workshops: How to Apply for Jobs in the Federal Government and Small Business Association’s How to Start a Business. 
 We would like to extend our gratitude to employer partners who took the time to meet with hundreds of members of our diverse and talented workforce including:
