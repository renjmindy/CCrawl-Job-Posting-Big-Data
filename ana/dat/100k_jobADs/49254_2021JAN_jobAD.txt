 About Geomiq 
 This is manufacturing, but not as you know it. 
 Geomiq is pioneering the next generation of online Manufacturing; leading the way in product and technology innovation. 
 We provide on-demand custom part production for the worlds leading companies. Our platform has helped customer from individuals through to unicorns and beyond. This is an exciting and stimulating marketing to serve. 
 We have just closed a recent funding round, now totalling $2.9m investment from leading international investors including Samaipata, the Made.com founder and others. This investment will fuel our continued growth in existing and new territories and enable us to invest further in our data and technological capabilities. 
 About The Role 
 The next-gen manufacturing industry (4IR) is ripe for disruption. Instead of using the few major software houses in the industry, we've opted to build our system from scratch using a modern tech stack with a best-in-class continuous delivery pipeline. 
 In this role, your mission, should you choose to accept it, will be to architect and develop a next-generation quoting and ordering platform for both buyers and suppliers of custom manufactured components that that can support the rich domain of hardware innovation. 
 Each member of the team is given the responsibility to research, innovate, design, propose, test and improve their solutions. We use data and A/B testing for most decision making. 
 We currently use the below tools but open to others;
