 Are you an experienced Quality Manager / Senior Quality Engineer who can lead both the Production and Systems Quality through significant improvement, for a medium volume, semi-automated manufacturer based in Burton? 
 This business is a UK leader in their field of expertise and has an enviable client base with some genuine blue chip customers; typically customer-led, the business is on a journey to World Class manufacture, and investing significantly in people, plant and equipment to get their. 
 I'm looking for an individual contributor who can help drive fundamental change in the way a business operates. You'll guide thought leadership, cultural change and process improvement/adherence in a business not used to working to World Class quality methods & metrics. 
 You will be key in ensuring that the current processes and systems are adhered to and at the same time have an eye on Continuous Improvement activity across the two factories from a Quality perspective. You will have demonstrable experience working with ISO9001. You get real buy in from your peers and colleagues, facilitating improvement across the business. 
 A background in a fast-paced environment within Automotive / Industrial Manufacturing; most important is a mindset of problem solving and corrective action where you take ownership of any issues and manage them through to resolution and ensure they don't rise again in the future. You need to be a communicator and a hands on Quality Manager who can instil a mindset of Quality across the organisation and the supplier base. 
 This role will come with challenge but also autonomy and ownership and career development potential and so this will be a great position for those seeking to move their career forward and develop within an international environment. If you feel that this could be for you, please apply or get in touch with Paul Strachan on 07725-844784. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
