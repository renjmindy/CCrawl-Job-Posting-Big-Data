 Every now and then, I see articles that suggest telecommuting and working at home in general is in decline. While it may be true that some folks who turned to freelancing and other work-at-home options after the economy tanked in 2008 are returning to traditional jobs, more and more people are opting to work from home. According to  FlexJobs , the number of remote jobs has grown 52 percent since 2014. It goes on to list the top fields for remote work as: 
 
 Medical and Health 
 Computer and IT 
 Customer Service 
 Education and Training 
 Sales 
 Finance 
 Government 
 
 While some jobs in the above areas require specialized education, many  work-at-home jobs today don't require training or experience . The fact of the matter is, many companies recognize the value of hiring home-based workers and continue to hire. If you're looking for a work-at-home job in 2018, here are some of the top industries and companies to check out.
