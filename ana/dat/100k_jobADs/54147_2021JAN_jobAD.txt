 The Greatest Moments From Kobe Bryant's Career

 Kobe Bryant announced he'll retire next season from basketball. We saw it coming before three seasons. The Black Mambas days were numbered, with harms stacking up and with more time off the court than on. 
 
 Here is his letter in full length: 
 Beloved Basketball, 
 In the second 
 I began rolling my father’s tube socks 
 And shooting fantastic 
 Game-winning shots 
 In the Great Western Forum 
 I understood one thing was actual: 
 I fell in love 
 A love so deep I gave you my all — 
 From my head & body 
 To my nature & soul. 
 As a six-year old son 
 Profoundly in love with you 
 I never found the end of the tunnel. 
 I just found myself 
 Running out of one. 
 And I ran. 
 I ran up and down every court 
 After every loose ball for you. 
 You asked for my hustle 
 I gave you my heart 
 Because it came with so much more. 
 I played through the perspiration and damage 
 Not because challenge called me 
 But because YOU called me. 
 I did everything for YOU 
 Because that’s what you do 
 When someone makes you feel as 
 Living as you’ve made me feel. 
 You gave a six-year old son his Laker dream 
 And I’ll always adore you for this. 
 But I ca’t adore you obsessively for much more. 
 This season is all I 've left to give. 
 My heart can take the beating 
 My head can manage the grind 
 But my body understands it’s time to say good-bye. 
 And that’s OK. 
 I’m prepared to let you go. 
 I need one to understand now 
 So we both can savor every minute we 've left together. 
 The great and the poor. 
 we 've given each other 
 All that we have. 
 And we both understand, regardless of what I do next 
 I’ll constantly be that child 
 With the rolled up socks 
 Garbage can in the corner 
 :05 seconds on the clock 
 Ball within my hands. 
 5 …; 4 …; 3 …; 2 …; 1 
 Love you always, 
 Kobe 
 
 To honor the guy that brought a fresh showtime to LA, we've assembled you his finest seconds to appreciate and recall the player he once was. Thank you Kobe.
