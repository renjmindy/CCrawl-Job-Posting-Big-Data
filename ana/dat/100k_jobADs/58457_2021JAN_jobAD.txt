  'Am I Money?' #11 - Seasoned Professional With Limited Career Tools, Will it Affect His Job Search?  
 Work It Daily 
 June 24, 2009 
 I've only been working with Twitter for a few days now, my username is  @ichigorno . I haven't had the opportunity to write any cover letters as of yet, but here is my most up-to-date resume. Resume So, am I money or not? Thanks Robert _______________________________________________________________________________ Dear Robert, I think you do have money potential. However, at this point, I'm only going to give you 3.0. Why? Because you're a seasoned professional with have a good amount of experience and it's not being showcased well in the tools you are currently using! You've got skills and talents but they are not being highlighted properly. Here's what I suggest:  Re RESUME:  You've created what's called a functional resume. You are trying to focus the reader on your strengths. I think the intent is great, but the execution needs work. As an IT professional with a background in project management, you know that to execute something well, you've got to understand your user's needs and make sure it meets them. Resumes are the same. You need to offer a hiring manager the ability to get a clear sense of who you are while making them feel confident you'd be capable of doing the job. Right now, your resume is sending mixed messages in the following ways:  1) The new rules of resume design stress that you do not make biased statements of self-promotion.  Your resume should only contain facts. So, listing at the top that you are "Creative Innovator/Problem Solver/Process Improvement/High Ethics" is not effective. You are stating your opinion of yourself. The hiring manager wants to be the judge of your skills in this area as compared to their company and job description. Also, you use words like "strong" and "successful" to describe yourself. Again, this is your opinion and should be left off. Your opportunity to sell yourself in that fashion occurs in your cover letter. Think 'soft sell' when it comes to your resume.  2) The summary paragraph about yourself is too long and actually should be removed all together.  Almost every resume designer I know right now is telling their clients to drop this kind of summary. Hiring managers want to see bullets with major skill sets with the years of experience next to each one so they can quickly make a mental checklist that says, "yes, he's got what we need." Moreover, you mention working for Fortune 100's and yet no where on your resume can the reader tie that statement back to your work history. In short, the paragraph, if it gets read, is going to be questioned.  3) Your key skills should not be in paragraph form.  It's too hard too read and again, is subjective in the way it is written. I'd remove this as well.  4) Your education is your strongest asset and yet it is buried in the middle of the resume and hard to find.  The fact that you have the MIS should be front and center at the top, as well as the rest of your education in clear bullets that draw the eye in.  5) Your 'Selected Accomplishments' section is good, but needs to be formatted so the reader can assess each one line by line.  Also, think of ways to quantify each accomplishment so it stands out more (see next point for explanation why).  6) Your work experience needs accomplishments tied to it.  You should be able to list 1-2 bullets under each one outlining quantifiable achievements while working at each one. It's a proven fact that numbers are the most memorable thing on a resume. You need to use stats and figures to draw attention to the depth of your work experience. I really think if you can revamp your resume as suggested above, it will get more than just a glance by hiring managers.  Re Twitter:  I know you just got started on Twitter but I do hope you find time to explore it more. As a tech person, a lot of people in your industry are getting connected on Twitter. Also, you can build a wonderful professional brand by creating a Twitter feed that would let potential hiring manager see how technically savvy you are. Simply focus on posting comments and links to articles that are related to your field and they'll know you are serious about your profession. That being said, I would find a professional picture of yourself and put it up in place of the one you have right now. If you'd like to have a separate Twitter account for fun, then feel free to use your current one where you can make the picture whatever you want. But, I'd then suggest you create a second, more professional one that has your own photo, an easy to recognize username and a good stream of career-related content - that's the one you should use for job search. This tool called  "Twitter for your Career"  can help you understand how to leverage it properly.  Additional Suggestions:  Once you get the above in good working order, I'd suggest you set up your LinkedIn account and get networking. And of course, Facebook is always a good networking option is well. People need to not just know you are looking for work, you need to help them help you find work. This means reaching out individually and saying 'hello' to past colleagues, friends and family. The more networking you do, the more you can spread the word about the kind of work you want to do. Getting job leads and landing interviews through social media use is not a random occurrence anymore. But it's not going to happen if you don't get in the game! I hope this info helps. You have such great potential to be serious money - you just need to invest in yourself!
