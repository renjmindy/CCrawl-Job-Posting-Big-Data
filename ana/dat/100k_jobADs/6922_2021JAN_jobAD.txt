 Bill Gates on Steve Jobs Taste

 This is an old quote but one that I still find interesting: 
 
 Well, Iâ€™d give a lot to have Steveâ€™s taste. [laughter] He has naturalâ€“itâ€™s not a joke at all. I think in terms of intuitive taste, both for people and products, you know, we sat in Mac product reviews where there were questions about software choices, how things would be done that I viewed as an engineering question, you know, and thatâ€™s just how my mind works. And Iâ€™d see Steve make the decision based on a sense of people and product that, you know, is even hard for me to explain. The way he does things is just different and, you know, I think itâ€™s magical. And in that case, wow. 
 
 This is quote is from the 2007 D5 Conference which you can watch here: 
 YouTube - Steve Jobs and Bill Gates Face Off 
 Video Transcript 
 Both were geniuses and for Bill Gates to give that much of a compliment after all the years of battling with Apple, says a lot about his great character. Of course, the statement is also true. Steve Jobs did have great taste. ðŸ™‚
