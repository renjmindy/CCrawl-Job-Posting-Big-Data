 This is an exceptional opportunity to join a refreshingly energetic business, where their people and clients are extremely important to them. Our Reading based client (who are part of a much larger Group with their HQ in the USA), has asked us to seek a personable, engaging Credit Controller, who is able to offer extensive recent experience, looking for their next opportunity, and reporting to the Financial Controller. 
 This offers a great chance to work across some of the business's key accounts and aid them in maintaining a varied UK ledger. 
 The existing team of 7 in the finance team are the real selling point here, as they have all been with the business for a good amount of time, work really well together and are very warm and welcoming. The company also offers market leading benefits, including 25 days holiday, pension, private medical and flexible hours. This is an opportunity not to be missed! 
 Daily duties as a Credit Controller will include: 
 
 Daily responsibility for the collection of cash across a ledger of around 500 - 800 live accounts, handling a busy UK 
 Reconciling bank accounts 
 Maintain and reduce the DSO where possible 
 Working to company policy and timescales regarding outstanding debt 
 Being confident in suggesting solutions for accounts that have issues or need action 
 Working collaboratively within the Credit Control team 
 Suggesting any improvements for procedures and processes 
 Providing reports for management on a weekly basis 
 Ad-hoc projects 
 
 Ideal profile as a Credit Controller: 
 
 Enthusiastic, energetic, combined with a passion for credit control 
 Able to tackle problems and queries with ease 
 A confident user of Outlook, Excel and accounting packages 
 Previous experience of working in a similar role

This is a great opportunity to step into a challenging role with endless career opportunities. Our client is based in Reading, offers plenty of free parking, modern offices and are within easy reach of all public transport routes.
