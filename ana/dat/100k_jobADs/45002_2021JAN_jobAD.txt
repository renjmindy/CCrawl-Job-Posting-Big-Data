 Grants for early-career peatland scientists/practitioners 
 January 28, 2020  /  uktropicalpeat 
 There are still several days to apply for an Allan Robertson Grant from the  International Peatland Society . These are prestigious grants (though the application is relatively brief - plenty of time to still apply!), which offer funding to support your peatland work, as well as funding for travel to/from and registration for the  International Peatland Congress  to be held in Tallinn, Estonia, in June of 2020. 
 There is a huge chance for you young members of the UK TPWG and other organisations to receive one of the 250-500€ grants if you apply within the next few days. 
 The main requirement is that applicants are under the age of 30, though this is somewhat flexible if a good reason is given. Both students and young employees are eligible. 
 Have a look at the conditions and share the information within your network:  https://peatlands.org/about-us/honoursgrants/ 
 Application deadline is already  31 January .
