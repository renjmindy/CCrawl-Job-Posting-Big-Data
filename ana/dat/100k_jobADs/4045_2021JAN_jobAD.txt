 Hey brothers and sisters in christ, 
 I pray you all are having an amazing  Monday. Some may dred Mondays but I get excited becausr it is another day that the father has given me to serve him. So when you think about getting into your everyday task back at work, don't look at it as same rhing different day. Look at it as how can I serve the Sovereign God today.  Praise the Lord! !

 My name is Wilhelmina Lundy and I am a servant of the most high Sovereign God,no matter where I am in life I am service to God comes first Hallelujah!!!! 
 Ok we are back to Job, it was a busy week I was moving so old studies were posted did you enjoy them, we visited daniel couple of times I do love the book of Daniel. Don't forget that on the weekends please look out for old blogs. Let's get in to the word 
 Job chapter 26 
 Verse 1-4 
 Job says to Bildad sarcastically. How have you helped others that are powerless and feeble, what advice havevyou given those who are lost? Who's spirit spoke from your mouth? 
 Job reminds us that when we open our mouths to those looking for answers, to those that are depressed, we should be allowing the holy spirit to speak through us. I was scrolling through wordpress today and I saw a post drom my wellbeing and learning Journey  that said the Daily Post word of the day is fragile here is the link if you want to see it Fragile -  http://wp.me/s7q7UE-fragile . This post reminded me that the broken spirit is fragile, so lets speak life and not our own opinions but allow the holy spirit to use you for His purpose. 
 Verse 5-8 
 Job says the dead are scared, yhose beneath the wayers and all that live in them. Death is naked before God, destruction lies uncovered. He created all this. He wraps up the water in the clouds, yet the clouds don't burst under their weight (The weight of the water) 
 Job is telling us that God sees all things. He is powerful he spreads out the skys. He wraps up the water in the clouds and then the light as a feather air thin clouds that separates / disintegrates like cotton candy is strong enough to hold tons of water. Glory to God  who else can do that? 
 Verse 9-14 
 Job say He covers the face of the moon with the clouds he tells the sea where it begins and where it ends. 
 The pillars of heaven shake in terror at his rebuke. By His power her turns uo the sea, by His wisdom he cuts idols to pieces 
 We see only but a piece of his power but his voice is but a whisper to us. Who can understand the strength of his power 
 Job reminds us that we serve a powerful God who isbthe creator of all things. We never should doubt what he does  and can do. He turned up the sea (Exodus 14:21) He can handle anything that tries to come our way. He is bigger than all things and in heaven. 
 Now for the Important part, if you are looking for salvation Google, download the free bible app or turn your bible to Romans 10:9 and confess with your mouth and believe with your heart that Jesus died on the cross and God raised him from the dead you will be saved. GLORYYYY TO GOD find a good bible based church and start a relationship with our Sovereign God.
