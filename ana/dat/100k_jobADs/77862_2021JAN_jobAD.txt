 Caregiver Jobs in Montreal 
 Posted on  July 2, 2009  by  caregiver 
 This caregiver agency that offers caregiver jobs in Montreal has been established for more than 10 years. They specialize in placing qualified, responsible, caring and dedicated caregivers with the best available caregiver jobs in Montreal because they believe in treating all of their clients with the highest standards of professionalism and respect by providing them with the best possible service. 
 Finding the ideal caregiver jobs applicant for your children or elderly family members can sometimes feel very overwhelming and stressful. Working as an intermediary between the caregiver jobs applicant and the employer, they aim to make the process an easy, pleasant and stress-free experience. Their clients' happiness and satisfaction is their main goal. Placing a caregiver jobs applicant with the perfect employer may require some time but the final result will definitely be worth the wait for all involved. And they’ll do everything humanly possible to place caregiver jobs applicants as quickly as they can. 
 There is a shortage of Canadians who are available to work in live-in caregiver jobs. In order to keep up with such demand the live-in Caregiver Jobs Program was developed to bring qualified foreign individuals who are available for caregiver jobs on a live-in basis. To qualify for the caregiver jobs program, these three requisites must be met by the caregiver jobs applicant. 
 
 
 You must have successfully completed the equivalent of a Canadian high school education. This requirement will help to ensure that you will be able to succeed in the general labour market if you apply for permanent residence after two years in live-in caregiver jobs. 
 
 
 You must have six months of full-time training in a classroom setting or twelve months of full-time paid caregiver jobs employment, including at least six months of continuous caregiver jobs employment with one employer in a field or occupation related to the job you are seeking as a live-in caregiver. 
 
 
 You must be able to speak, read and understand either English or French at a level that allows you to function independently in a home setting. For example, you must be able to contact emergency services if required and to understand labels on medication. You will be unsupervised for most of the day and may be required to communicate with someone outside the home. A good knowledge of English or French will also enable you to read and understand your rights and obligations. 
 
 
 For the caregiver jobs applicant’s immigration requirements, the caregiver jobs agency’s certified immigration consultant can assist them with the following: 
 
 Permanent Residence 
 Visitor Visa 
 Work Permit 
 Sponsorship

 Ms. Myra, 
 Every article I have posted on my website Caregiver Work Abroad corresponds to a specific caregiver agency in search of qualified candidates for caregiver jobs. All you have to do is read each article and choose for yourself which agency suits your preferences. In each article, I have also provided my visitors with all the necessary informations on how to contact the agency involved, or how to apply for the said caregiver jobs.
