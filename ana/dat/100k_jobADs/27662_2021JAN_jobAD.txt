 Role overview 
 
 Senior Front-end Engineer (US-based only) 
 Eagle Eye Networks Engineering: 
 At Eagle Eye Networks, our engineering domain ranges from embedded IoT devices to web and mobile front-ends. Eagle Eye Networks is a complete platform from top to bottom, providing hardware and software solutions for the video surveillance industry worldwide. 
 If this sounds exciting to you, come join our team! 
 Role: 
 Eagle Eye Networks Engineering has a truly unique opportunity for well-rounded engineers. Sure, call it a Front-end Engineer position, however the Eagle Eye Networksâ€™ technology stack extends beyond the usual front-end/backend developer definitions. 
 So whatâ€™s unique? As a developer, imagine part of your responsibilities being able to build new systems and services from the ground up, from scratch, having real opportunities to create instead of trying to find creativity in maintaining existing systems. Do you have experience building web applications that rely heavily on web sockets? We are building microservices atop a large scale worldwide streaming architecture. If you want to know more or have experience in this area, you might be a great fit for our team. 
 Responsibilities include: 
 
 Build and maintain our web application 
 Maintain our web application by refactoring and progressing the application forward to more optimized and cleaner code. 
 Work with websockets and bidirectional communication protocols for a more performant user experience. 
 Build primitive constructs for reusability throughout the application. 
 Utilize optimization techniques like compressing Javascript files and compressing template files for a faster load time user experience. 
 Build and maintain external single page web application and internal web service interfaces related to microservices. 
 Build modular web components that can be integrated with our Cloud VMS web application. 
 Quickly prototype new web application features. 
 Continually improve our frontend build process. 
 Modularize components to be used by third parties 
 Build javascript components to be used by third party integrators. 
 Build off the shelf templates that can be used by third parties or modified by third parties. 
 Build advanced Modularized Components 
 Own the Eagle Eye Networks HTML 5 video player. 
 Provide an awesome PTZ experience on 360 cameras using web technologies like WebGL. 
 Operate and improve upon the current SaaS/Cloud platform using Kubernetes and Docker containers on bare-metal across co-located data centers around the world. Must be able to manage large scale deployments and services in our data centers. 
 Design and develop microservices from the ground up using Docker containers, taking ownership of projects from inception to release. 
 Create rapid prototypes and documentation. 
 Build for scale. 
 Create and maintain the metric driven environment. 
 Use log aggregation to paint a story and understand system behavior. 
 Log performance on API endpoints and optimize for speed and efficiency. 
 
 Desired Skills & Experience: 
 
 Javascript, Emberjs, node - 5+ years 
 Rest APIs, Git, JIRA â€“ 3+ years 
 Python experience â€“ 2+ years 
 Web Services, Flask, Django - 1+ years 
 Strong knowledge of TCP/IP and HTTP 
 Docker, Kubernetes, Vue.js, virtualization experience is a plus

We eliminate a tremendous amount of headache by putting everything in the cloud where we can take care of it and you donâ€™t have to. We are growing fast and are always looking for the best professionals to be part of our sales, engineering, support, production and operational departments team.
