 Director:  Charles Ferguson 
 Writer:  Charles Ferguson 
 Pretty horrifying look at the economic crash of 2008. I am no expert in finance, watching people talking about this stuff for 2 hours made my head spin, but I don't see how anyone watching this wouldn't be angry by the end of it. How these few people get to just gamble with peoples money and have the ability to ruin the country, for what? The whole thing is just a glorified casino. Pretty sickening.
