 I wrote a couple of blogs for the Guardian careers recently, one which is now live:  http://careers.guardian.co.uk/careers-blog/higher-education-career-options 
The second one, which will hopefully go live in a week or two, is more focused on networking, applications and interviews. Both are whistlestop tours. There is so much more I could have said. And both are quite general - I realise there are differences dependent on discipline but these are general tips for all aspiring academics. One thing I didn't really make space for was to talk much about postdocs and research fellowships, focusing instead on the permanent jobs that are available. I'll try and blog about that here at some point. 
Another really area I could have said more about is international academic jobs. At work we're trying to improve our resources about finding academic work abroad. In the meantime, UCL has a good resource  http://www.ucl.ac.uk/researchcareers/resources/overseasacademia.htm
