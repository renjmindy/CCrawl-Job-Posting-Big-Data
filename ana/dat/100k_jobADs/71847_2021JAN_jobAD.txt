 Seeking a ________ (first perk - pick you own title!) for a young fashion tech business.  We are looking for someone with development and coding experience to join our journey, in creating a platform for users, who are looking for an alternative to fast fashion and sales orientated product sites. 
 We are in the early stages of prototyping and seeking someone with a development background to help us build out the engine of our curation platform.  The aim of our product is to help users find that perfect fitting wardrobe. 
 The last year has seen a huge growth in online retail, which is a great opportunity for a product that can help people cut through the noise and to help them find what they are looking for; rather than scrolling through endless pages of irrelevant items and discount code pop-ups.  For brands, helping customers find the best fitting item first time, also means significant cost savings from managing returns and wastage due to ill-fits and wrong sizing.  We want to see that change in the fashion industry and be part of that change; to create something that will really make a difference. 
 Your fellow co-founder is a first-time entrepreneur, ex-financial services, who is looking for that next challenge and seeking to build something that will add value to the future of fashion retailing.  This is an equity role and remuneration will be negotiated subject to your experience and availability.  We are London based, but open to candidates from various locations, so if you have a technical background in back-end (and optionally front-end) development and have an interest in building a product that will create a new space for fashion retailing, we would love to hear from you! 
 Do introduce yourself and let us know what you are looking for in a role, including any experience that you feel would be relevant for the product type and/or industry. 
 No agencies please - thank you!
