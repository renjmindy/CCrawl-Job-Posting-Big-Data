 I find something else confusing about Participles 
 Present Participle is used to refer Simple Present or Simple Past. It could refer Present Continuous or Past Continuous as well. 
He always says goodbye before leaving. (before he leaves) 
He used to say goodbye before leaving. (before he left) 
 Perfect Participle is used to refer Present Perfect or Past Perfect. 
Having taken his master's degree,he will apply a job. (After he has taken..) 
Having taken his master's degree,he applied a job. (After he had taken..) 
 But The book called Grammarway says the sentences above have the same meaning,so 
we can use both two participles here.I have difficulty understanding. 
 After taking his master's degree,he applied for a job. 
After having taken his master's degree,he applied for a job. 
 Thanks in advance

 After taking his master's degree, he applied for a job.

 Your first sentence sounds fine to me.Your second sounds strange because the participial clause is introduced with 'after'. It would be fine without 'after'. I think the pastness is already signalled by 'after' and this renders the perfective redundant.

Can we use the verb "apply for" with "master's degree"? For example, can I say "I applied for master's degree." Thanks in advance.

 Normally you apply for a course, rather than a degree, but sometimes people do say 'master's degree' when they mean 'master's degree course'. You also need to add a determiner:  my  master's degree or  a  master's degree.
