 Values and an academic career 
 Posted on  October 31, 2017  by  researchstudentcareers 
 I did a workshop recently with some PhD students from across Europe. We were talking about values and an academic career. I had come across a couple of articles on this that I thought may be interesting to share. Have a look at the summary of the articles below and think about how your own personal values may or may not be a good fit for an academic career - and how this may help with your career decision making. 
 
 A small study of biomedical sciences PhD graduates that showed they chose an academic career (or not) based on their personal values, and not on how successful they had been during their PhD 
 
 
 
 Another small study of academic faculty in the USA that built up a picture of the values that attracted them to an academic career 
 
 If you want to talk about any implications for your own career decision making then do make an appointment with a careers consultant.
