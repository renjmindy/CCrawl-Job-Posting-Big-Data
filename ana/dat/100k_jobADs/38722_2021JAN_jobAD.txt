 Job References: What If Former Bosses Don't Work There Anymore? 
 By  Ronnie Ann   3 Comments 
 Hi Ronnie Ann. I am a Preschool teacher wanting to return to work. Unfortunately, the places I have been employed have a huge employee turnover rate. So my former bosses don't work there anymore. In fact, NONE of my previous directors or co-workers are currently employed at those places. 
 How do I handle this lack of good references on  job applications ? I don't have a problem with prospective employers contacting previous employment places. But there is no one currently employed who knows me. And definitely no previous boss. 
 It looks pretty bad on applications if I mark ‚ÄúNo. May not contact.‚Äù Even part-time for summer jobs I had, either the former supervisor is no longer around, the company changed names, or the company is no longer in existence. 
 Please, I need your expert help. I don't want to lose any possible job opportunities due to this. And I have an excellent work history. In all cases, I left positions for good reasons, including an unforeseen medical issue, pregnancy, moved or needed full-time hours. 
 Thanks for your time and advice.

 If former bosses don't work at former jobs‚Ä¶ 
 Hi TB! 
 First ‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt worry. There‚Äôs usually a way around a situation like this. Not everyone stays in their jobs -‚Äì no matter what the industry. So sometimes references disappear. And most future employers know that. 
 Also, with such a high turnover rate in your field, odds are your prospective employer will be even more likely to understand. These things happen. And if an employer needs to hire good people, they find a way to check them out. 
 More than ever,  companies turn to"online snooping." . And then there are companies they can hire that research people, especially if you'll be working with children. Or, if none of that works for them ‚Ä¶ they can use their gut to make the final decision. 
 So definitely mark ‚ÄúMay contact.‚Äù And if there is a place on the application to explain your situation, do so clearly and simply. You might even want to prepare a separate sheet to attach that has your explanation -- as well as several good references. I've used that technique in my own job searches. 
 So where do you get these references? 
 If former bosses don't work where they once did, it‚Äôs worth making a strong effort to get in touch with someone with whom you worked. Even if you have to track them down on  LinkedIn  or do your own snooping online to find them. 
 Hopefully you were friendly with some of the people and actually know where they are now. Or sometimes, as I mentioned, it just takes a little detective work. You'd be surprised how much you can find online now if you really dig in and look. 
 Also, you can ask your former companies if the people you knew left forwarding addresses. Or phone numbers. Or whether  anyone  working there now knows how to get in touch with someone who knows you. 
 Just explain your situation. And be very friendly and polite. Sometimes the former company will even contact them for you and ask if it‚Äôs ok for you to contact them. 
 Will these references be good enough? 
 Assuming they don‚Äôt mind, it‚Äôs perfectly fine to use these people as references. Even if they are no longer at the company you worked for. Just make sure you explain to your prospective employer that they used to be at ABC Company and are now at XYZ Company. (Again, you can use your reference sheet to do that briefly.) 
 As for the place that had a name change, that‚Äôs ok too. A name change doesn‚Äôt mean there isn‚Äôt still someone there who remembers you. At least, it‚Äôs worth trying. Just list the company name as it was when you worked for them. And in parentheses add the new company name: (LMN Company (now known as QRS, Inc.) 
 You say you have an excellent work history, but it's hard to prove it unless you have someone to vouch for you. Or solid documentation like performance reviews. Understandably anyone applying for a job working with children has to find good references. 
 Just as a note:  If you haven‚Äôt maintained contact with people from the past, please remember to do so from now on. You can see how important it can be! 
 ‚áí EXTRA:  Start Building Networking Connections That Last! 
 Are there good alternatives to work references? 
 Now if you absolutely can‚Äôt find anyone you‚Äôve worked with (and it still would be best if you could), then you need to come up with someone you‚Äôve volunteered for. And / or a person of professional standing -‚Äì especially in the education field -‚Äì who could provide you with a reference if needed. 
 If all this fails, just be honest with your potential employer and explain the situation carefully. And honestly. Tell them you're excited about coming back to work and would love to work for this company. Then ask what they would accept instead of work references, saying you‚Äôd be happy to do whatever it takes. Even if that means a trial period. 
 Again, if former bosses don't work there anymore and your goal is simply to make it past the application stage, you can prepare that reference sheet. Just include it with your application. Next to each name, explain who this person is. And add a note on top explaining why these alternatives to direct bosses. It may just do the trick. 
 Addressing the gap question 
 By the way ‚Ä¶ I assume since you have no current references, it‚Äôs been a while since you‚Äôve worked. This will bring up  gap questions . Also the fact that you‚Äôve had quite a few jobs will raise questions. 
 Still, it sounds like you have good reasons for leaving. Just be prepared to address the issues in detail during an interview. Any employer wants to feel secure that you're ready to work again. And will stay with them for as long as possible. 
 One last trick 
 If you try everything and still run up against a roadblock (and I hope that‚Äôs not the case), then take a refresher course. And do your very best. Get to know your teacher. And make a good impression. 
 If the class has a student-teaching component, then get to know that teacher.  A related volunteer job could also help . This way you can get yourself some fresh references -- even if your old former bosses don't work where you did anymore.. üôÇ 
 I wish you all the best. Good luck!

 Hi Ronnie, 
 I am currently seeking work in the admin field and I took voluntary redundancy in November last year. I was recently offered a job involving admin work at a care home. All the checks have come back fine, but one out of two of my references has responded, which I find odd as both references were friends at my last job and I was actually very good in my job - always helping out and volunteering to do things for them and others. 
 The reason I didn't give my previous manager as a reference is simply because I didn't get on with her very well towards the end of my job - I did when I first started out on her team and then somewhere down the line something in her snapped and she wasn't easy to work with anymore. 
 I also supplied two other people as references as my potential employer got back to me to say only one of the ones aforementioned responded. They have yet to get back to me, does that mean that I won't be able to work there? I'm also worried that the references I supplied have also said something to my previous manager and she has told them not to supply them with a reference for me. 
 Thanks 
 Jo

 Hi Seema! 
 If you don't have any work experience, the best you can do is explain that (they should already know that if they've seen your resume) and provide the name of someone you've helped on a volunteer project or as part of some organization even if you didn't get paid. You can also offer the name of a professor or teachers, especially if they can vouch for how you handle assignments and work with others. Other than that, your best bet is someone who is in a responsible position who can vouch for you personally. 
 It can be hard getting that first job, but let them see how determined you are to do a great job for them and just do your best to provide them with the best reference you can come up with - even if it's someone you helped on a bake sale or on a committee to improve your neighborhood. 
 Good luck, Seema! And by the way‚Ä¶my name is Ronnie Ann. üòâ
