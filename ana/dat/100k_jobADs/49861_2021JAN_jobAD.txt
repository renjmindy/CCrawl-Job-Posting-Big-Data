 Hiring Our Heroes 
 November 10, 2020 
 Carl Beck 
 Discovering Workiva  through the Hiring Our Heroes program 
While I was stationed at Fort Carson, Colorado as an Army Field Artillery Officer, I learned of the Hiring our Heroes Corporate Fellowship Program (CSP). This was a 12-week transition program where I would spend the last 12 weeks of my time in the Army conducting a fellowship with a company. Workiva was one of the companies that participated in the program, and I had heard about their amazing culture and was excited by their mission to solve complex business problems through innovative software. 
 Working with the Talent Acquisition team 
I began working with the Workiva Talent Acquisition team and conducted my fellowship as a Delivery Manager, which eventually led to a full-time offer. 
 I am fortunate that Talent Acquisition was willing to pursue this program, although I am most fortunate that my director took a chance on interviewing and hiring me through this program. I am both thankful and lucky to be working in her organization to this day. 
 Workiva supports and empowers veterans 
Workiva leads with values and leadership principles. Inclusion is one of those core values, and this fosters a workplace where differences are celebrated and everyone can be themselves. I am a member of one of our seven Employee Resources Groups: Veterans in Tech. In this group, I’m able to connect with other veterans, share stories and continue to bond over similar experiences. Workiva also honors all veterans with a paid day off annually on November 11. 
 Bringing more veterans into the tech industry 
I continue to be involved with the Talent Acquisition team and support them in their pursuit of hiring veterans through CSPs, veteran career fairs, and other programs such as Service to Software. Workiva is also exploring additional partnerships to attract and hire veterans.
