 Just another day on the job 
 Posted on  February 2, 2012  by   LostMedic 
 Yep, it's another day of work for me! Today hasn't been the boring, nothing to do kind of days as before, we actually had to help people, which is normally rare here, except for this year. Last year we ran just over 1000 EMS calls, that's even low for us. This year doesn't seem to follow that pattern, we are up to 87 calls and it's only February 2nd. I'm not complaining though, I love helping people! Hate seeing them hurt, but love helping them. And I really can't complain because some of our neighboring departments run 4 to 5000+ calls a year, some even into the 8000+ range. Which is completely crazy busy!! 
 Today we helped a neighboring department with a cardiac arrest and it looks like the lady might make it. (Thank you God!) She had a good strong pulse and blood pressure upon our arrival to the er. The crews worked together and did a great job! Ever ran a call on an ambulance that isn't yours, your rarely see, and have never gone though…? Try that in a cardiac arrest…not fun. We stole all our equipment off our truck and it made things only slightly easier, but that's what happens in small town EMS, you just go with the flow. 
 While today is all work and little play, Tuesday was a little work and a lot of play! Much encouraged by the Chief, his motto is "have fun at work." Awesome Chief in my opinion! On our way to lunch Tuesday, we spotted something that had us laughing so hard we actually had to stop the ambulance for pictures! 
 
 
 It's not every day you get to see this! lol And many of you don't know the wonderful game of " Slugbug " which is something we play around here. Needless to say, we were laughing to hard to actually slug anyone! And it sure had the town watching too! 
 Being a volunteer firefighter also, I'd like to share a picture we found the other day at work that has now been passed around Facebook. Other volunteers out there will laugh at this as well, I'm sure.
