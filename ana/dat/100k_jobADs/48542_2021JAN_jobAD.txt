 Bigger and better in 2018. 
 “2018 is a year where Sagittarians can rely on a little magic. ‘One dream, one soul, one prize, one goal, one golden glance of what could be’ – the atmosphere around you is more electric and also more supportive, you feel increasingly plugged in to a grand scheme. Sagittarians are magnets for new situations and circumstances which offer more than you even imagined. Flashes of light show the way as your intuition fires up and guides you onto surprising routes where you are joined by people who before seemed opposed to you, but who you now see are on the same mission. Inner contentment and peace can be found more easily now via both the people you meet and circumstances you find yourself in. ‘The day will dawn of sanity’ as Jupiter acts as your guardian angel offering you spiritual protection and you are able to rid yourself of self-destructive tendencies, deeply ingrained fears and the burden of guilt. The bell that rings inside your mind is challenging the door which your own fears and anxieties have kept locked to you for so long. The magic is in unlocking, releasing and shining light into the dark places in your life.” 
 A big thank you to all the amazon and B&N buyers who supported me over the past 4 years and also to my youtube channel subscribers. 
Are you looking in the mirror wondering what 2018 will hold? Do you feel at an important crossroads? Do you need direction or a kick start? Are you wondering 'what now' in terms of love and relationships? How are the Stars lining up for you in 2018? What opportunities can they supply the energy for? 
Popular resident astrologer of BBC WM Lisa Lazuli takes her straightening, down to earth approach to astrology from the air waves to the bookshelf with this insightful and motivational book. Includes a detailed yearly overview for Sagittarius, followed by monthly forecasts broken into love, life, health and career. A chatty, sincere read to help inspire, guide and alert you to the unique possibilities of your life on a practical, emotional and spiritual level.
