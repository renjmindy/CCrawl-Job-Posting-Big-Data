 There are  a lot  of  work from home jobs . But they're not all in demand remote jobs. Some are rare or just random. For example, I've seen remote jobs for matchmaker, virtual dog trainer, information ninja, and even sailing instructor (how?). While interesting, these jobs just aren't in demand enough to offer two important things: 
 
 Job security 
 Career opportunities 
 
 And, after a rollercoaster ride of year that we call 2020, it's really important that we plan remote-friendly careers that are pandemic proof and popular as we head into the future. 
 That's why I put together this super mega list of 196 (and counting)  in demand remote jobs  for 2021 (and beyond). 
 How did I compile this list? 
 Well, over the last year I heavily researched the  top remote industries . With so many people looking for remote work, it was important to identify the industries readily embracing remote work. 
 These were the industries that continued to hire when many others were laying off workers by the hundreds and thousands. Of course,  as a career coach , I often steered my clients towards these industries to help them land on their feet in a steady role. 
 But I wanted to take it even further and identify  the most popular job titles  frequently posted on remote job board sites. 
 The result? An amazingly comprehensive list of remote jobs that are here to stay. Period. 
 This is a long list divided up by category. So, settle in and grab a cup of coffee â˜•You've got some reading to do. 
 How to Use This List 
 Whether you're a career changer, career pivoter, or an  unemployed remote job seeker , use this list to  inspire your remote job search . See if your current (or most recent) job title is on this list. If so, great! You're already primed and ready to launch a remote job search. 
 However, if you don't see any job titles that are close to the ones you've held, don't panic. Often, you have transferable skills that you can use to land a remote job. 
 As you browse the list, see if any industries or specific job titles pique your interest. Research those job titles and see what skills, education, and experience you need to be considered for employment. If you don't have any of those skills, that's okay too. You're never more than an  online course away  from learning a remote-friendly skill you can use to get a remote job. 
 And, don't forget to use my  no-fail 3-step system to figure  out your dream remote job. Because, after all,  we don 't want you to settle  for any remote job. You deserve to find your dream remote job and, chances are, it's on this list! 
 Administrative 
 
 Thanks to remote collaboration tools like Google Docs and Trello, it's pretty easy to perform administrative tasks from (almost) anywhere. You can work with people around the world to manage emails, schedule appointments, coordinate meetings, manage documents, and so much more. 
 A clerical background is helpful. But you can also find online courses and training to prepare you for an in-demand remote administrative role. For example,  Fully Booked VA  is a go-to training center for aspiring administrative professionals. 
 Whether you already have the skills or need a quick refresher, there are plenty of remote administrative roles to consider:

 Business 
 
 In demand remote jobs in business are quite broad. They include all business roles you find in most corporations. To make this list more readable, I combined human resources, operations, and legal positions under the business category. 
 Most of these roles require a degree, specific work experience, or both to be considered. However, a handful of options like General Transcription and Legal Transcription can be learned via online training at schools like  Transcribe Anywhere . 
 If you have previous in-office experience, chances are you already have transferable skills you can use right now to market yourself in one of these remote business roles.

 Customer Service 
 
 As a career coach, I hear over and over again from clients that they will do anything but customer service. I get it. Customer service jobs can be a bit of a drag. You envision yourself taking call after call from unhappy customers leaving you completely drained by day's end. 
 Fortunately, not all customer service jobs are like this. In fact, in demand customer service remote jobs include reservations agents, travel agents, tech support reps, and even chat reps -- no phone required! 
 As a bonus, the majority of  customer service jobs from home  are entry-level.

 Data 
 
 What is data? Well, data can mean a lot of things. Typically, remote data jobs deal with statistics, facts, and figures in an analytical way. 
 You might run reports, make predictions or forecasts from a business point of view. 
 Most data jobs will require formal training and/or experience to get started. If a data career sounds interesting to you, I highly recommend you research the industry further to determine if it fits with your career ideals. 
 From there, check out Coursera for  Data Literacy  courses you can take in your spare time to advance your career!

 Design 
 
 Design is all around us, especially online. Every website you visit, blog you read, ad you see -- they're all design driven. And, as it turns out, design jobs are in high demand and super remote friendly. 
 Design jobs will require specific training. Most roles have specific hard skills you need to have. For example, you might need to know Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, etc. depending on the position. 
 When you're new to the world of design, a simple course like  Basic Elements of Design: Design Principles and Software Overview  can prepare you to confidently enter the digital design world as a beginner!

 Editorial 
 
 Editorial remote roles are near and dear to my heart. I love writing, content creation, reading, proofreading and all the wordsmith roles widely available today. 
 You too can cash in on your love of words to create an editorial career as a writer, proofreader, editor, copywriter, researcher, and more. 
 When it comes to remote writing jobs, the proof is in the pudding. In other words, you need a  portfolio of work to showcase your skills  more than you need a specific degree. 
 However, training is beneficial in specific roles like copywriting and proofreading as you'll learn the ins and outs of marketing your skills. My favorite proofreading classes are this  free general proofreading workshop  as well as the masterclass at  Art of Proofreading .

 Education 
 
 In 2020, we saw so many students head online to learn. As it turns out, many teachers and students enjoyed the switch to digital learning and are eager to stay on this path in the future. (I personally have a 100% online learner at home with me!). 
 With such a high demand for online learning, there's been a surge in hiring for various education positions in the remote world. 
 These jobs range from educator to administrator, and everything in between. Your state will have individual requirements for online educators, but there are entry level gigs in education for Online English tutors as well as admissions counselors for higher education.

 From a financial perspective, there are quite a few in demand remote jobs to be had. These include everything from working one-on-one with individuals as a bookkeeper or tax preparer to corporate roles in underwriting or payroll. 
 Finance jobs from home range from entry-level friendly to more experienced accounting roles. 
 If this industry is appealing to you, I recommend sitting in on free training to learn more. My favorite freebie for aspiring financial pros is the  3-series video training  at Bookkeepers.com.

 Healthcare 
 
 We typically don't think of healthcare as a remote role. That's because we think of clinics, hospitals, and in person places most frequently with healthcare. 
 However, as we saw in 2020, healthcare can also be remote friendly. For example,  telehealth visits were up 154% in 2020  (and are expected to rise in the coming years). 
 Plus, there are plenty of non-clinical roles, like  medical billing and coding jobs , that are more admin than patient-facing. These jobs can be done remotely and are in high demand. In fact, one  CNBC study  found there are more openings for medical billing and coding jobs than there are trained professionals to fill them!

 Marketing 
 
 What is marketing? Typically, marketing refers to activities that helps businesses understand their customers. Brands want to better understand their customers so they can build consumer loyalty. 
 Often, marketing is confused with sales -- but they're two different functions. (That's why you'll see sales as a completely different industry on this list ðŸ™‚ 
 Marketers create campaigns, analyze data, or put together materials to promote a brand. Remote marketing jobs include job titles in social media, search engine optimization, affiliates, public relations, and more!

 Sales 
 
 Sales jobs are always in demand, remote or not. That's because the sales team brings in money. And, without money, businesses can't survive. 
 But sales jobs go far beyond telemarketing. Virtual sales reps might take inbound calls, respond to chats, or help existing customers to keep them as clients. 
 Many sales jobs are beginner friendly, as long as you have a determination to succeed. As you gain experience in remote sales, you can move up to roles like Account Manager or Sales Manager.

 Software & Development 
 
 Tech jobs are some of the most in demand remote jobs out there. Period. Yes, there's a huge need for tech pros but it's also because development and tech-based jobs include a lot of different job titles. 
 In my list, you will see coding jobs, developer positions, and even QA roles grouped together under the umbrella term of "software and development." 
 Keep in mind, there are A LOT of different roads to explore for tech roles. If you don't have current experience or education in the field, it's a good idea to get some. 
 Simply search programs on Coursera to get a good idea of  Algorithms, Data Collection, and Starting to Code . You will soon find if this path speaks to you or not.
