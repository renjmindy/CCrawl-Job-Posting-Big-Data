 Hi Sarah, 
 I'm applying! I love Germany-and have not given up on my dream to work/live there! I'm sending my CV along with your blog post featuring me, and the Alsc's post of me featured as their member of the month. Any words to the wise? 
 I have a good job and nice life, but, this is my final work goal. Beyond that…icing! Actually, this job would be icing! 
 Thank you, 
 Brenda Hahn
