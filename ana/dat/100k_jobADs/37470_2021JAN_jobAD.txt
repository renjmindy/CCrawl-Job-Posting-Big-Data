 He said that scientists must do a better job  of policing  themselves and  trying  to be heard over the loudest voices on cable news, talk radio and the Internet. --taken from the NYT

 Dear all, 
 If I rewrite the above like this: ....must do a better job  to police  ...and  try  to be heard ...., could you tell me whether it is idiomatic with the same meaning? Thanks.

 As written, we understand that they are already policing themselves and trying to be heard. They should "do a better job of" these activities - do them better. 
 In the re-written version,  job  has been detached from  policing  and  trying . I don't know what it refers to any more. There is also much less sense, if any, that they are currently doing anything to police themselves or to try to be heard.
