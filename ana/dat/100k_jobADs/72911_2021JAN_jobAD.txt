 " The acquisition of wealth is not our prime motivation, we seek to better ourselves." 
 That paraphrasing of Patrick Stewart's dialogue from the film STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT, is central to Gene Roddenberry's enduring mythos, his conceit of a world… beyond greed. 
 I think as mission statements go, as core beliefs go… that is as good a one for the human race as I can think of. 
 _ 
"The acquisition of wealth is not our prime motivation, we seek to better ourselves."_ 
 However with the move to an industrial society at the launch of the 20th century, and the gutting of the previous agrarian/barter model, the acquisition of wealth, the consolidation of wealth, became the driving theme of the 20th century. 
 And it's no coincidence that the 20th century also became the bloodiest in the history of the world, though clearly the 21st century is on fast track for supplanting it. Never in the history of the world, have so many, died so quickly, from nuclear weapons, to biological weapons, to push button wars, and all of it driven by the 20th century deification of money. 
 Not to say money is not felt throughout other centuries, but not to the global, and near religious personification, that the pursuit of wealth became with the 20th century, it has become idol absolute of an entire world. 
 But the 21st century with concepts such as peer to peer, open source, social networking, was poised to create a model for the 21st century. A model that akin to Roddenberry's dream, could very much usurp the industrial model, just as the industrial model had usurped the Agrarian model. 
 The age of technology, open technology, had it, and has it in its grasp, to bring us more in line with this slightly Utopian concept, of life lived for improvement and discovery, rather than accumulation and subjugation. 
 But the dinosaurs, The Microsofts, the RIAAs, the Sonys, the Disneys, have co-opted, and outlawed, and sued, and bullied and terrorized the new hope, all so they may maintain… the old terror. 
 Scared Dinosaurs, holding humanity back… from visionary new days. Companies,courts, and politicians… and their paid enforcement arms, all working so hard to hold onto the bloody old, all working so hard not to evolve. 
 Microsoft and their setting up of the DMCA, and their last couple of years of buying their way into the open-source movement, worming their way into 'helping' with the open-source movement, particularly Linux, all so they could destroy and extort the movement from within. 
 You see this on the mobile side, where their various mobile Window initiatives cannot compete with Apple or Android. They now are extorting money from companies that do utilize Android on the basis of ridiculous and innovation killing software patents. 
 (It's largely recognized that Software Patents are a lunacy that need to be done away with) 
 It is the act of a gangster and a thug, and if IBM was allowed to act like this in the 80s there would have been no Microsoft and no Apple, because these actions exterminate free enterprise and innovation. 
 Microsoft has spent the last twenty years burning every bridge and every freedom, that they themselves utilized in order to be innovative and initially successful, and now completely outlawing those liberties, indeed those necessities, for companies other than themselves. 
 Microsoft 's time has passed. They are a dinosaur using terror and intimidation to extort customers they can no longer earn with quality. They are no different than a 20th century Capone, selling liquor and protection at the barrel of a gun. 
 And Windows 7 was an improvement over Vista, they had 'borrowed' enough of the concepts and look from other operating systems to make it one. But that said, Windows 7 was and is still inferior to any half decent Linux Distribution. 
 So just as they are committing extortion against Android on the mobile front, on the Desktop/Server front they are dealing with the brilliance and the growth of Linux, that is now ready for prime-time, ready to be the next big thing, to replace the sick, twisted, decaying, and immoral dinosaur that Microsoft has become…. they are dealing with this fresh beautiful new thing, by basically collaborating with hardware vendors to KILL the very ability to install Linux operating systems on your computer. _They are so afraid of Linux they want to make it impossible for you to even install it on YOUR computer. 
 It is so sad and pathetic, that it is almost funny._ 
 Again what if IBM had done that to them, Microsoft and Apple? We would, as a society, be the poorer for it. And we are going to be the poorer for it if we allow Microsoft to continue to get away with dismantling any innovative idea or company they can't compete with. 
 Can you understand? For Microsoft to do this, for a tech, for a software person, for someone with a rudimentary concept of how companies like Microsoft and Apple came to be, it is a betrayal of not just everything that is the technology movement, it is an attack on innovation and free enterprise that must stand as one of the most blatant and disgusting that I have ever witnessed. 
 It is a crime. As great a crime, in its way, as US drone airplanes killing indiscriminatingly in darker lands, so that a white press can gloat about another bounty collected, another arab, another nigger dead. 
 Though they don't dress it, this 21st century crusade, in those crude terms, any more then Microsoft dresses its actions as what it is, a bloody monopoly committed to eradicating your option to choose. 
 _" Pay us or else!" That's how business talks to consumers in the 21st century. And it is a form of war. Less bloody to be sure, but the repercussions of what it can mean to freedoms subtle and gross… is staggering. 
 And I… am not having it._ 
 I haven't used Windows in my personal computer in 3 to 4 years. I fix Windows machines and work on them for other people, but for myself Linux is the only OS/distribution I deal with. I love the freedom of it, the very thing Microsoft is working so hard to legalize and sue and intimidate away. 
 I'm not going back to Microsoft. And to those companies that they are intimidating, extorting, bullying, I can only tell you what I would tell anyone being bullied… you start letting people push you, and they are never going to stop. 
 You have to stand against them. 
 And maybe you win, and maybe you lose. But you teach them to pay for every foot of ground. You give them a bloody nose, and win, lose or draw… it will give them pause. 
 Microsoft is a pathetic, barren, immoral, and worst of all inferior and scared technology company, and they are standing in the way of a better life…for everyone. 
 They are protecting the rotting, diseased old, when what it is time for… is the new. 
 And if you're a company, and have been on the Microsoft merry-go-round it's scary to consider getting off of it, but it is infinitely scarier to stay at the mercy of an immoral monopoly. 
 There are viable open source alternatives to Microsoft's over priced crap. 
 Explore them. 
 Not only for your own sake, but for something companies start out believing in, but lose along the way, for the sake… of progress. 
 That's an idea that Microsoft gave up on, a long time ago. 
 _ 
"The acquisition of wealth is not our prime motivation, we seek to better ourselves."_ 
 It's the only goal, that will save us from all this blood. 
 If you're a subscriber to this blog and want help ditching Microsoft and finding something that works for you, reach out to me… and we'll find an answer that works for you. 
 We'll be a new age Untouchables, facing the tyranny that is Microsoft's Capone. 
 And maybe we win, and maybe we lose. But my God, we'll give them reason to pause. 
 Here endeth the Lesson.
