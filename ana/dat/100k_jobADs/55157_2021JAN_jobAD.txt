 What is hoo? 
The internet has changed the world (mostly) for the better, but occasionally things are just plain 
wrong - sometimes the balance needs to be redressed. 
 For far too long, the existing online travel agents "OTAs" have been taking hotels and customers for the wrong sort of ride. OTAs control how hotels are discovered online; they control the price that hotels can advertise their rooms for; and they create a false impression of competition - because most of the major online booking brands are owned by just two companies. Not surprising that travellers think they are getting the best deal available, when 'the internet' is showing the same price everywhere, including the hotel's own site. And what do hotels get charged for the privilege of these big OTAs selling their rooms? 15-40% commission on every booking (top end if you want to appear high in the platform's search results). 
 Well, that's unfair - people deserve a great deal more. 
 At hoo, we are going to redefine the booking experience, putting businesses at the heart and let customers have their say in how much they pay. This is a different way of buying hotel rooms. It's a marketplace where buyers and sellers are brought together, for a more honest and fair value exchange. 
 It's time to shake up the industry and turn it on its head. Giving full control to all - once and for all. 
The booking revol-hoo-tion is coming. 
 What is the Social Media Intern role? - Job Description 
 Reporting to our co-founder and the CMO, you will be responsible for all our output on the social media channels we care about. 
 We have been working with a branding partner to define our positioning and launch messaging, and social media will be our primary channel for delivering this to our audience and demonstrate we can deliver on our promise to ultimately change hotel booking for the better - for good. When the outside world reads or watches our content or hears our opinion, they should understand what we stand for and be excited to find out more. 
 
 You will be working across all social platforms and will need to be present wherever our audience is. 
 You will be able to speak to them in language that means something to them. Together we will help you understand and develop the right tone and language for all the content you write or create.
