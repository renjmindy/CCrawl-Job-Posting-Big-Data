  5 Things Every Employer Wants To Hear In An Interview

 Ever wonder what a potential boss wants to hear in an interview? What exactly can  you  say that will increase your chances of receiving a job offer? 
 
 I recently heard some great advice that lined up with my previous experience as a human resources manager, and so I thought I would share this great advice with you! Here are five things to communicate during an interview that will convince the employer you're a great hire. 
 1. You Will Never Have To Tell Me What To Do Twice 
 Every employer wants to know they can give you instructions once, and you'll get the job done. I guarantee you that no employer wants to micromanage or ask an employee more than once to do something—no matter what it is. 
 2. I Will Complete The Job/Assignment You Give Me With Excellence 
 The employer wants to hear that, no matter what, you are going to make it happen—that you're going to get the job done and do it to the best of your ability. 
 3. I Am An Agreeable Person 
 The employer wants to know that no matter what situation you are put in, you're going to be a team player—and that you're not going to create confusion, conflict, problems, or challenge their authority. 
 4. I Am Easy To Correct And Instruct; I Am Teachable 
 If there is something that's not getting done, or if you're not doing it correctly, the employer wants to know that they can approach you to discuss the situation and that you're not going to fly off the handle or think you're superior. 
 5. I Am A Loyal Employee 
 I will not talk poorly about you. I will do everything I can to promote you and help promote this business. While I am working for you I will always be the best employee—whether for 1 year or 10 years. And should I leave, I will be rehire-able, and I will leave in an amicable and responsible manner. 
 Prospective employers nowadays understand that asking employees to make a commitment to stay for 10, or even 25 years, just isn't realistic.  Loyalty isn't about longevity.  It's about being a committed and responsible employee while you're with that company. 
 These five points are essentially what every employer wants to hear from a potential employee. Of course, this isn't an end-all, be-all of an interview. But if you can communicate these very important points to a prospective employer during an interview, you will stand out among the other job candidates, and it will help the interviewer believe that you would be an asset to the organization.
