  5 Mistakes Job Seekers Make On Their Resume  
 Jessica Holbrook Hernandez 
 March 03, 2015 
 I'm sitting in front of my computer trying to think of a new way to say the same things I've already said a million times.  Related:   4 Simple Ways To Overcome The Age Factor In Your Resume  I think I'm beginning to feel border line preachy with my resume and cover letter advice. But I also feel a duty to share with job seekers the blunders and mistakes they make that prohibit them from getting the interview and ultimately the offer. 
 
 Mistakes Job Seekers Make On Their Resume 
 After ten years of working as a human resources manager and recruiter – I've seen my fair share of job seeker mistakes. So, here's my list of the five biggest mistakes job seekers make on their resume: 
 Mistake #1: Using Outdated Formatting 
 The first impression your resume gives is critical. How do you want the hiring manager to perceive you? Professional and accomplished? Or sloppy and disorganized? Old and outdated formats only reflect poorly on you as a viable candidate for the position. 
 Mistake #2: Using An Objective 
 If your resume has an objective please stop. That is an outdated practice no longer relevant in today's job market. Objectives will only land you in the “bland, just like everyone else pile" not the “oh yeah, don't let me forget to call them today pile." 
 Mistake #3: Forgetting Important Keywords 
 Don't forget to use industry specific keywords. Also make sure you know where to put them. The top section of the resume is the best place because that's where the hiring manager's eyes will be drawn. Short keywords are a great way to tell the employer about your expertise. 
 Mistake #4: It's Too Long (Or Too Short) 
 Too long or too short and you've lost your hiring manager. Keep paragraphs to 3-5 sentences and the same goes for the number of bullets you use in your resume. Why? Any longer and you lose the audience in information overload... and shorter, you appear underqualified. 
 Mistake #5: Listing Responsibilities Instead Of Accomplishments 
 The hiring manager doesn't want your resume to be an exact repeat of the job ad. They already know what they need. What they need to know is how you're going to meet their needs. Utilize statements that demonstrate your expertise and accomplishments in a given area. Certainly there was a challenge you faced while working for your current or previous employers. How did you address these challenges and what were the results? The answers to these questions make for GREAT  bullet points on a resume .  This post was originally published on an earlier date.
