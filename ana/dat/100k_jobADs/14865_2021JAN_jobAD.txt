 How to clear your inbox of recruiter emails 
 I recently googled how to clear inbox of X recruiter emails. It was an interesting read about all the derogatory references to recruiters, but not terribly helpful. 
 Some ideas: 
 Search your inbox by state references one at a time and delete all the emails. Most of jobs are concentrated on the east and left coasts so a few quick searches can hit a bulk of them. 
 ", CA" 
 ", WA" 
 ", OR" 
 ", NV" 
 ", TX" 
 ", MN" 
 ", IL" 
 There go about 10,000 emailsâ€¦. 
 Next you can search on Contract, H1B, Full Time 
 That should clear out a few 1,000 
 A search for Unsubscribe will probably hit most of the commercial emails. 
 You get the idea. 
 After a maybe an hours work you can get your inbox down to the personal emails you actually want to read. 
 I also use filters and labels as well as email rules to handle the volume of recruiter emails. Hopefully this has been helpful for someone.
