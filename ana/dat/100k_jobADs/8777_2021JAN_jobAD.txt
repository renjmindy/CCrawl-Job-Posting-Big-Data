 Assorted shit 
 Dick the tease 
 AFP photo 
 The Associated Press reports  that 69-year-old Dick Cheney’s latest heart attack was his  fifth one  since he was 37 years old. 
 Cheney (shown above in a photo taken before he attended Barack Obama’s inauguration in D.C.) had what the AP reports was a “mild heart attack” yesterday. 
 Every time that you hear that Dick has been taken to the hospital you hope that  this is  it,  but, not to be outdone by Freddy or Jason, he is expected to be released from the hospital any time now. 
 Many, many deserving people can’t get adequate health care, but  war criminals  get the best health care possible. There’s no justice. 
 ‘Benedict Brown’ tea-bagged

 Wingnuts are fucktards. 
 They’re bashing Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown  (shown above at the Wingnuts’ Annual Ball last week) for being a “turncoat” because of his support for a Democratically authored jobs-creation bill. 
 Retards: Scott Brown is a U.S. senator for  Massachusetts . Although he’s a Repugnican, Massachusetts remains predominantly blue. Therefore, he can’t be the Nazi that you’d like him to be if he wants to get re-elected when his term is up in a couple of years. 
 Two other New England Repugnican senators who voted along with Brown against a Repugnican filibuster of the jobs-creation bill were Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine. Notes the AP: 
 Snowe and Collins … “survive in New England by a unique set of rules,” said Dante Scala, political science professor at the University of New Hampshire. 
 He said: “The way they survive with voters in their homes state is by making it clear that, first and foremost, they’re the servants of their constituencies, not the party label. So, they’ll make a point of defying their party and going their own way.” 
 Brown got little such leeway, despite campaigning as an “independent Republican” and publicly eschewing national supporters. 
 The political realities of the great blue state of California also disallow Repugnican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger from being the Nazi that the “tea party” dipshits would like him to be. 
 Schwarzenegger this week alone  defended the Obama administration’s stimulus package , stating that it has benefited California “tremendously,” criticized Repugnican politicans who have opposed the stimulus package (but who have reaped its political benefits anyway), and stated that the Repugnican idea that Obama’s health care plan should be scrapped and started over from scratch is  “bogus,” “partisan” talk . 
 Schwarzenegger isn’t running for re-election, either, as he can’t; he terms out in less than a year. 
 He probably just doesn’t want to go to hell, and thus figures that he actually should do what politicians  should  be doing: trying to  help people. 
 Stimulation accomplished 
 From The Associated Press today : 
 Washington – The economic stimulus law added between 1 million to 2.1 million workers to employment rolls by the end of last year, a new report released [today] by congressional economists said. 
 The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office study also said the $862 billion stimulus added between 1.5 to 3.5 percentage points to the growth of the economy in 2009. The controversial stimulus law combined tax breaks for individuals and businesses with lots of government spending. 
 The report reflects agreement among economists that the measure boosted the economy. But the wide range of estimates means it won’t resolve the debate over how effective the stimulus has been. 
 The White House says the stimulus bill has created 2 million jobs and will add another 1.5 million this year as economic recovery continues to take hold. 
 CBO projects that the stimulus measure to have a greater impact this year, boosting gross domestic product by 1.4 to 4 percentage points and lowering the unemployment rate by 0.7 to 1.8 percentage points. 
 The report said the most efficient parts of the stimulus include infrastructure projects such as road- and bridge-building and more generous unemployment benefits…. 
 The economy has shed 8.4 million jobs since the start of the recession in December of 2007, though job losses have slowed in the past couple of months. 
 The stimulus measure has earned mixed grades from a public weary of a bad economy and increasingly concerned about out-of-control budget deficits. Democrats are seeking to renew several parts of the stimulus, however, including aid for state governments and extended unemployment insurance benefits for the long-term jobless…. 
 I’m no economist, but it’s irrefutable the nation started hemorrhaging jobs on BushCheneyCorp’s watch and is recovering under the Obama administration’s watch. 
 Yet the “tea party” fucktards, like chickens swearing their allegiance to Colonel Sanders,  oppose  the president who apparently slowly but surely is turning the Titanic back around. 
 Really: It takes a  special  kind of  fucktard  to  work against one’s own fucking interests. 
 Steeling from the donors?

 Politico has a story  on how many Repugnicans are furious that Repugnican National Committee chair Michael Steele apparently has been on a spending spree. The first three paragraphs: 
 Republican National Chairman Michael Steele is spending twice as much as his recent predecessors on private planes and paying more for limousines, catering and flowers – expenses that are infuriating the party’s major donors who say Repugnicans need every penny they can get for the fight to win back Congress. 
 Most recently, donors grumbled when Steele hired renowned chef Wolfgang Puck’s local crew to cater the RNC’s Christmas party inside the trendy Newseum on Pennsylvania Avenue, and then moved its annual winter meeting from Washington to Hawaii. [The news photo above was taken late last month in Honolulu…] 
 For some major GOP donors, both decisions were symbolic of the kind of wasteful spending habits they claim has become endemic to his tenure at the RNC. When Ken Mehlman served as the committee chairman during the critical 2006 midterm elections, the holiday party was held in a headquarters conference room and Chic-fil-A was the caterer. 
 What’s the problem? 
 The Repugnicans chose Michael Steele in January 2009 as a knee-jerk response to the November 2008 election of President Barack Obama; they wanted to show the nation that Hey,  they  can be hip, too! 
 Obama and Steele have lots in common, including their love of  stimulus packages  and  hanging out in Hawaii,  apparently. 
 Speaking of Hawaii, hey, has anyone checked Steele’s  birth certificate? 
 Maybe the Repugnicans can oust him  that  way, before he  completely  empties the safe.
