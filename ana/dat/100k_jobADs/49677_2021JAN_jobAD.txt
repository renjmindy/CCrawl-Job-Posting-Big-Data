 I am currently working exclusively with a business with an International footprint that are involved within manufacturing as they are currently looking for an Assistant Financial Controller based in their Willenhall office. 
 This is a genuinely exciting opportunity for someone seeking the next step in their career. With a strong customer base, you will be responsible for internal and external stakeholder management, along with budgeting & forecasting, producing management reports, statutory accounts, long range forecasts and internal controls. 
 With well-located offices just off the M6, the company is looking for a strong personality to be the next Financial Controller. 
 The business are keen to add to their strong and friendly working environment with this role. 
 The position will be heavily focused on Business Partnering with other divisions of the group and working in a heavily commercial environment. The successful candidate will need strong technical ability along with solid relationship building skills. 
 This position will be focused around both the day-to-day financial operations, but also much larger group projects. You will ideally be ACCA, ACA or CIMA qualified and have the gravitas to implement change and nurture and develop relationships internally as well as externally. 
 For the successful Assistant Financial Controller, they are looking to pay between £40,000 to £48,000 DOE. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
