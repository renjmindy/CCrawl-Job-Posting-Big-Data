 Innovative Ways of Serving Job Seekers during Pandemic 
 Updated: Oct 9, 2020 
 Job seekers in Faulkner County had an opportunity to learn about many job openings and additional services available to them at the Central Arkansas Workforce Development Area’s first Drive-Thru Job Fair in August 2020. 
 Since the pandemic, many businesses and worksites shut down offices in Arkansas which created notable complications in the recruiting process for employers still hiring. In an effort to continue serving and supporting workers, businesses and our communities, the Workforce Development Area’s team, which included partners such as the Arkansas Division of Workforce Services and the Arkansas Department of Human Services, found an innovative way to connect job seekers with employment opportunities and other resources. 
 During the event, job seekers visited the Arkansas Workforce Center in Conway and stayed in their vehicle as they drove thru the parking lot to receive a bag full of information including job opportunities and local resources available in the community. 
 As a result, over 1,200 job seekers were connected to resources and job opportunities to help them through the unprecedented times.
