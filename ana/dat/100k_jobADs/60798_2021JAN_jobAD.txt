 (satire - I think) 
 The Culture Secretary Maria Miller was preparing for life outside politics after the Prime Minister  David Cameron refused to withhold his full confidence  in her - effectively ending her political career. 
 A spokesperson for the Culture Secretary said: 
 
 My understanding is that Ms Miller was expecting to survive the scandal over her expenses claims but now the prime minister has turned on her by pledging his full support she realises her political career is all but over. 
 It wouldn't have been so bad if he'd been a bit half-hearted about it but a full pledge of confidence from the prime minister is obviously the kiss of death. 
 
 Ms Miller's pending resignation follows other political careers brutally cut short by full pledges of support from the Prime Minister such as his former treasurer Peter Cruddas, his former director of communications Andy Coulson and his former chief whip Andrew Mitchell.

 The wheels are coming off the Gravy Train. 
 After doing such an outstanding job as the "invisible" Minister for the Disabled as well. 
 Couldn't happen to a nicer person.

 This news item was in the daily mirror yesterday.. Hypocracy writ large. Bash 'feckless idle.. Scare them into working for nothing. But never mind the whitehall benefit scrounging can go on with the PM backing.

 Yeah that puzzled me ., minister for disabled . But wait, there are no disabled are there as they are all benefit scroungers according to the Daily Heil and Express. 
So, lets see, 
 Minister for Benefit Scroungers gets generous but fair allowances .. Hmm

 Sorry Tom but I came across this from a short while ago, it is to do with one of your less than favourite newspapers. 
Its to do with homelessness .. 
Oh by the way.. Ive been seeing lots of 'luxury apartments' appearing all over the place and i have hardly seen anyone living in them or very few.. Someone told me these properties are somehow connected to tax avoidance and or money laundering…

 This from a publication in Jersey 
 "Theres homeless people on the island? 
ha ha unlucky, but i cant see a reason they couldn’t sort themselves out? even get the most basic job possible, the job centers there for a reason. I have no pity for homeless people, all of them are wasters and drug addicts or lazy sponging immigrants" 
 Cheery, eh?
