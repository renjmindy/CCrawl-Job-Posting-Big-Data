 2012 -- Your Year in Choads 
 December 30, 2012December 30, 2012  /  julesagray  /  11 Comments 
 2012 will be noted in the record books as one of the choadiest years ever. Why oh why would you make such a proclamation, Julia? Not only did we have one of the  oddest   years  in  human  behavior, but the election shenanigans put the 'crap' in craptastic choadiness. 
 2012 was ugly from day one and it just got uglier and uglier as the year progressed- especially in the political arena. Needless to say, the folks on the following list not only embarrassed us the world over, but they sure did a bang-up job of making the human race look like a big pile of chunk-filled dung. (Note: John Boehner, Rush Limbaugh, Eric Cantor, Mitch McConnell, Bill O'Reilly, Hannity, Newt and the NRA are already in the Choad Hall of Fame, so mentioning them here would be redundant.) The vetting process was brutal and I know I'm missing some choads, but I'm sure they'll be on my 2013 list. 
 So, without further adieu and in no particular order, I present to you-my loyal three readers-Your Year in Choads. 
 The Donald. 
 
 (courtesy of examiner.com) 
 The thrice-married Trump never ceases to amaze me. He inherited millions from his father, then felt the need to continue to dumb down society with his tee vee  shows  and  tomes . He has even  sullied my city with a multi-floor steel phallus  with great views, and overpriced units. That was a Trump I could live with-out of my league financially and matrimonily-but I never bought into his bullshit so ignoring him wasn't a chore at all. However, he had to go and ruin it for me and everyone else by opening his fat yap about how the  President isn 't a citizen  and how the country was robbed during the election (even though Obama won the popular vote) with a series of ill-timed and  uber-choady Tweets -which he promptly deleted. Oh and early in the campaign, he was actually a candidate. But, never fear, Trump will be back in 2013, and will be a bigger choad than Donald Trump. Notice how I didn't even mention his hair? 
 Sheldon Adelson. 
 If  Citizens United  had a dick, Sheldon Adelson should be giving it blowies all the live long day as a thank-you gift. Yeah, I know. I have that image in my mental Rolodex too and I have no idea how to get it out of there. A brain transplant may turn out to be the way to go, and I'd be happy with an Abby Normal-esque brain at this point. The good thing is, Adelson's attempts to  buy the election failed  the way the uterus supposedly does when raped legitimately. Ahem. Imagine the good Adelson coulda done with that money had he done something useful, like for instance, help his beloved Israel build a better defense system. 
 And speaking of legitimate rape, there's  Todd Akin. 
 I'll let the magical combo of video and the Internets speak for Mr. Akin (who lost in November-big time-by the way). Akin's advisers, the "doctors" who told him about how the female body "works", anyone who has ever hung out with or believed in Akin, well, y'all are choads too. 
 Nikki Haley 
 
 Choads are not limited to men, my friends. Nooo…never. Not only did Gov. Haley NOT consider  Stephen Colbert  for Jim DeMint's now-vacate Senate seat, she doesn't want nuthin' to do with Obamacare even though her state, South Carolina, is desperate for the help. Like Haley's fellow GOP governors, she'd prefer to pout and eat worms in the garden because the smart, black guy won AGAIN, and now his monumental, life-saving legislation is truly the law of the land. Basically, she'd rather fuck over her constituents to make a point than help them. That horrid attitude makes her one of the Choads of the Year. 
 Richard Mourdock. 
 “Even if life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that is something that God intended to happen.” 
 
 (courtesy HuffPo) 
 He's rape's champion and for that,  he almost beat Rep. Joe Donnelly  in the Indiana race for the Senate. 
 What's even more amazing is some woman finds him fuckable. 
 Personhood Amendments/He-Man Woman Hater 's Club. 
 It's safe to say the today's GOP don't like us ladyfolk very much. That hatred was evident in the  candidates   they   nominated  and the legislation/ballot initiatives that so many states tried to pass, or  get on the ballots . Then, there was the kerfuffle over the transnatch ultrasound bill requiring all women in  Virginia  who wanted an abortion to have this lubed-up wand stuck up their hoo-hahs so they can see what's dancing on their bladders. The best part? Women have to pay for this humiliation out of their own pockets because Lord knows the GOP doesn't want to pay for it-hell, they'd rather protect guns than people, see. There are so many anti-woman stories that happened this year that writing about them would cause me to start biting my face again. 
 **But, I 'll give you one more to chew on. **  It's the creme-de-la-creme of choady anti-woman fucked-in-the-head laws that some states in this great country-you know the one that is the most powerful & most advanced in the entire world-seem to love to pass.  All of us ladies who still experience menses are pregnant whether we like it or not . That kinda sucks out loud. 
 Mike Huckabee 
 
 Gosh, there is so much that can be spewed about the good Rev. Mike. He's besties with  Chuck Norris ,  his son likes to kill dogs , he's has a love/hate relationship with weight loss,  he blames gays for all of society 's ills , and a bunch of other assorted treats that are too many to mention. 
 But, this vidya demonstrates just how choad-a-rrific this man of god really is. 
 Jan Brewer 
 
 (courtesy ABC News) 
 The weathered, ridden-hard-and-put-away-wet governor of Arizona is the greatest of all lady choads. She loathes people of color, has a pointy-anointy claw that she likes to point at the POTUS;  loves guns ; probably has nudie pix of Sheriff Joe Arpaio; allegedly shits Coppertone; kicks puppies; has a law that says all bleeding women are pregnant; is considering running for a third term; more than likely believes in  Henrietta Pussycat  but not climate change; and finally, contrary to popular belief, did NOT star in "There's Something About Mary."

 Major League Pantomime 
 September 19, 2012  /  julesagray  /  22 Comments 
 I was alerted about this vidya earlier today by one of my sisters, and it still makes me cackle like a scary old broad who's watching her mangy, rabid dog chase the neighborhood chirrun out of her damn yard. 
 This happened at a recent Chicago Cubs/Pittsburgh Pirates night game at Wrigley Field. 
 One caveat here -- I am  not  a baseball fan. It's not something I follow, but I will go to a game from time to time if the ticket is free and I'm plied with enough alcohol. Kidding about the alcohol part. Ok, ok …I'll go if there's an unlimited supply of ballpark hotdogs and Coolie Coos (or whatever they're called) waiting for me at the park. 
 I do know this much about baseball: The Cubs blow donk and Wrigley Field is the world's largest beer garden-but probably with more piss and puke strewn about, and guys with up-turned collars on their polo shirts and backwards baseball caps. Ew. 
 Plus, I used to live near Wrigley, and I grew weary of Cub fans from Schaumburg sullying my neighborhood with their shitty beer vomit and Schaumburgian ways.  And  the post-game puke on my car always killed my sunny disposition, and that memory is still knocking around the obsidian-like part of my soul. 
 However, this performance may restore my faith in America's Game or whatever it's called.

 Dear darling daughter: F*ck your husband often! 
 October 3, 2011January 4, 2012  /  julesagray  /  13 Comments 
 
 Dr. Michael Brown, Father of the Century. 
 I've been following the assault trial of serial wife beater,  Dr. Michael Brown  , for a while now. This guy is such a loon with mommy issues, I couldn't help but pay attention. If I lived in Texas, I would have been at the trial everyday. 
 I'm not a fan of wife beaters. No one deserves to get beat to a pulp-ever-even if you are the bread winner and you deem a wife as "property" so you see giving her a beating as your "right." That's fucking pathetic cowardly crap. Learn how to deal with life like a man. 
 If my husband ever laid a paw on me in a violent manner, he'd have to come at me hard because I'd fucking kill him. If you're stoooopid enough to raise a hand to me, then you don't deserve to draw another breath. Yes, I'm that strong, and that well-trained in martial arts so it wouldn't be pretty at all. Sadly, domestic violence still exists in this country, and sadder still is women feel the need to not only defend their husbands, but stay with them too. I don't get it, but then again, I'm not a good victim-it's not in my genetic make-up, thank dog. 
 Off mah soapbox now, and onto the loony letters ("Letters to Sophie") of advice Dr. Michael Brown wrote to his daughter, Sophie. No, the subject of these letters is not about how to be nice, how to succeed in school, or how to be the bestest tennis player EVER. No, they're about how she should fuck her husband, what it takes to have a happy marriage, and finally, how her mother is a bitch. 
 Let's dig in… it's just too damn good. 
 First letter is from June 2000, when Sophie was about a year old. From the  Houston Press . I was looking for areas to edit, but I couldn't. It's just too chock-full of sad, comedic material to cut. 
 " Want to have a happy marriage? Empower your husband with a great big ego and he won't let you down. Shower him with praise -- tell him he's the greatest and that's what he'll be. Nag, complain, criticize, and he ultimately will get enough and find someone else who makes him feel good, even if logically it will degenerate to the same level. So divorce is not even the answer. 
 Crush a man 's spirit by implying he is letting you down in some way, and he's utterly useless. The man wants you to view him as the world's greatest lover, such that you feel honored when he asks for sex -- say no and you crush a little bit of him. Yes, both man and wife should and will enjoy mutually fulfilling sex -- together (it is never fulfilling if you cheat -- temporary pleasure and immeasurable guilt forever). Yet, the man physically requires more sex to prevent hypertestosteronism and the…resultant idiocy of the male. Sex doesn't always have to make you see stars. Typically, it's the man doing most of the work. You are wise, not weak, to simply give him his 10 minutes of pleasure. Act like your enjoying it and he'll only take 5 minutes [sic]. Then, don't forget to tell him how wonderful he was." 
 There's probably some truth the physical results of no sex, but who cares? Since when does 'the man do most of the work'? Also, who cares about YOUR happiness, Sophie? Preserving his ego is oh so much more important than everything else. Learn it, know it, live it. 
 Obviously divorce WAS the answer for Dr. Brown, since he was just acquitted of abusing his fourth wife. Whattaguy. 
 Aaannnd there's more… **" Sorry, she had a nice ass and I was hard." **Good to know, DAD. 
 It was nice of Dr. Brown to title this particular letter: "Why Sophie Must Cry." 
 Oh no. This is gonna leave a mark. I just know it. 
 Again, this didn't deserve to be edited. 
 " I am writing this book for my sweet darling daughter Sophie and my dear sweet unborn daughter who I hope withh be called Roxanne Rianna Brown -- "Roxy." I love you so damn much babies….You two sweet smart babies whom I adore are the purpose and love of my life. You two are genetically programmed with such___intelligence as to make most cower in disbelief. How, fucking ever you too unfortunately have your mothers genetic constitution to be unbelievably cold hearted bitches…I am sorry for fucking your mother instead of someone else. 
 QUE intellect [arrow] fucking TOUCHED  _  You baby girls are my pride and joy. Unbelievably and unabashedly I will tell you I, yes I am the fucking alpha male and live to suit my dick until you two sweet children of GOD came along and now I live and breath for your happiness and God 's fulfillment…..Well my sweet baby girls I am your only SANE protector and I must PROTECT you two from your loving mother's idiocy and lunacy. I love you both and know you are part of GOD'S Plan. Sweet baby girls love your mother but PITY her for she is not even slightly worthy and contributory to your genetic constitution. The smart is from me the bitchy her. Sorry, she had a nice ass and I was hard." _ _ ****_ 
 I sincerely hope that both Roxy and Sophie have enough cash in the kitty to support either their heroin habits or the years and years of psychotherapy they're going to need if they ever get wind of these sonnets, OR if they're allowed to be raised by their doting, secure father, who really wishes they had never been born. I fear the worst for these girls. Anyone who has this much contempt for women, should be moved to Asshole Island because that's the only place that'll keep them safe. Sounds like Dr. Brown wasn't allowed to shit all over his wives, they called him on it and they paid dearly for it with beatings with bedposts, trips down the staircase whilst being pulled by their locks and general abuse. Again, I don't care what they did-no one deserves to get beat on. 
 Is anyone else bothered by a sentence that has "alpha male," "fucking", "dick," "God" and "two sweet children" in it? Shit howdy, I'm not even sure if is a sentence. 
 Finally, part three. I can't think of anything witty to say right now. Just read. FYI: The spelling errors are allll the good doctor's. 
 **" There are two aspects of sex….it's psycology and the technical aspect. Both are important. I am writing and describing to you the psycologic basis and atmosphere you are responsible in creating to promote sex which is essential to marital bliss. I am writing another book about the technical aspects of sex which I will give you when you get married. ** 
 The "technical book" will enlighten you. Your husband must have one too -- I'll write it if not for a brother of yours yet to be born than for him for you too deserve the…totality of sexual ecstasies -- God's gifts to be enjoyed, understood, and revered. Once you get the sex thing on track don't ever get complacent and forget…every 2 or 3 days at least & you initiate sex every few weeks. Use a calendar if you have to. Understand your husbands need for you two want sex (sex=love=sex) from him. If you show him you don't want sex you are in fact telling the male brain, evolved over millions of years, that you don't want his love, that you reject the…most valuable thing he can offer you, that you reject him. This is fact. Don't even think about taking issue with this one even though I want you to think for yourself…. 
 So sacred is sex that you must never hurt another with it by witholding it or telling (or acting like) you didn 't enjoy it. Sure you can tactfully let your husband know how to best please you but always he should feel that as far as you are concerned, in your eyes, he's the greatest lover who ever lived….If after sex say 20 minutes later the conversation begins with your husband saying "That was great!" rest assured he's not giving you a compliment (though he might want to) but rather he's trying to illicit a compliment from you. If you answer "yes" he's gonna continue fishing and may say "Did you enjoy it?" if you say "I said yes, quit asking" then you are diminishing the value of the just finished love-making….During lovemaking, your partner's enjoyment should be your prime concern….not your own. If you do this then you will be a technically and emotionally great lover….This kind of lovemaking yields an orgasm multiplied many times by the emotional satisfaction of knowing your partner appreciates you….Without the emotion and letting the other know they are giving you pleasure sex is merely "mechanical" with no advantage over masturbation." 
 First, a few bon mots about my dad. He never wrote a sex manual for any of us. Never. Ever. And I thank him for that. 
 It was tough to get through this part with all the creative spelling, the overdone ellipses-wait-who am I kidding? The horrible spelling and misused punctuation makes my crazy radar go crazy. He's a  physician  remember. 
 This is great fodder for some sort of 'psycological' study at one of the country's finer higher learnin' institutions. For starters, the fact that he finds withholding sex to be hurtful, and not beating up his spouses, just goes to prove how fucked in the head he truly is. 
 These letters are both disturbing and very interesting. At one point, he's praising how brilliant his daughter will be, and how she's blessed with all of these genetic gifts-from his gene pool of course. Yet, he wishes he had banged someone else instead of her mother. Then, he wants her to forget all that and just be really good at getting her husband off and not herself because that's selfish and bitchy. Oh and make sure you fake the emotions to keep his wee ego intact. For sexual release, you can masturbate, you know. 
 I need a  Silkwood  shower now. 
 And, I bet Dr. Brown is a shitty lay. And how could I possibly say such a bold statement? The answer is written in his meticulously kept chin pubes. Anyone who goes out of their way on a daily basis to keep their beard at that short of a length, doesn't quite get it.

 September 17, 2011October 3, 2011  /  julesagray  /  7 Comments 
 There's something so magical about  Coco . 
 
 Coco 
 Before you click away in utter disgust and decide to block my blog forever, maybe even report me for being a hack, a fraud OR worse-stooopid-please give me a chance. Who knows-you may even agree with me. If you do, you'll be a better person for it. 
 I admire and like Coco because she doesn't attempt to act smarter than she really is; she doesn't pretend to be something she isn't and is happy with who she is. Most important, she appears to not give a shit what others think of her. She's a gutsy broad who puts it all out there and doesn't seem to mind the negative press. Hey, she's making a shitload of cash off of her look, is in what appears to be a happy marriage and cares about those around her. In my book, that's huge. What do I admire about her the most? She's not a skinny chick, is proud of it and celebrates her curves. How refreshing! 
 Coco's a(n) (in)famous American woman who is comfortable in her own skin-a rare species here since we are trained from early on to despise ourselves for not being pretty, smart or thin enough. Or, for being too pretty, smart and thin. Those of us who dare attempt to break out of this hobbling, disgusting mold, are chastised and called selfish bitches. Hey, argue with me allll you want. Tell me I'm wrong with your so-called well-thought out arguments about how women have more power than ever before and I'll listen quietly. Then, when you're finished, I'll hand you a stack of fashion pubs & suggest you take a gander at the photos and ads & hopefully you'll see how all of the models are in dire need of a couple dozen Sliders-then try that lame-ass argument again. 
 The constant barrage of Biafra-esque thin women that grace the media, plus the multi-billion dollar diet & plastic surgery industries in this country, are constantly telling women we're not good enough physically. Sure, we've made huge strides as women, but we're still harshly judged by our looks over our intelligence and wit. If you don't believe me, think back to how horrible folks were toward Hillary Clinton's looks when she was running for President. Same with Sara Palin-yep, I said it. There was a lot of ridiculous attention paid to her looks-it even had me shaking my head because I noticed immediately that her room-temperature IQ was more dangerous and important than her appearance. Fortunately, anyone with a pulse realized that too-so we're safe-for now. 
 
 Coco's not like the  Kardashians  -who are desperately clawing their way up from the bottom of Crap Mountain to be taken seriously as something other than what they really are-fame whores. These sisters & Mama pimp would appear at the opening of Malaysian whore house if E! was in attendance. Sure, society is to blame for the Kardashian's success-this culture celebrates mediocrity. How else would you explain Dane Cook, George W. Bush and the entire  "Jersey Shore"  cast? But, I will give the K-Klan this much-good move on cashing in on your sibling's sex tape. Who knew that having tape of your  sister's muff being munched on by a mustachioed gutter dick could prove so profitable?  
 I wonder what Camille Paglia thinks of Coco. No…. wait…nah…not really. 
 There is much to say about Coco and whether or not she's good for us. Maybe I'll write more about her later, maybe not. But I'll leave you with what my pal Shannon M. said about this shot:  
 "That titty is way better looking than all of Janice Dickinson." 
 AAAAANNNND SCENE.
