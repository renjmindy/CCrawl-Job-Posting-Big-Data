 Sarah P 's comment : International school library positions are by far the most available and often the way to work in a remote country. For the better schools you will a school media certification. The above list is from TIE (The International Educator) which you need to subscribe to in order to learn the details of how to apply. TIE is well worth the annual $39.00 fee as their website also offers all sorts of information about international schools and how to obtain a job in one. They even maintain a resumes database.
