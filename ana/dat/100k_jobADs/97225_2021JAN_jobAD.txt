 Virgo Horoscope 2018 - Love, Life, Career and Health

 Bigger and Better for 2018. 
 “2018 is a journey on the Orient Express with you experiencing views across the expanse of opportunity, watching high mountains of expectations, seeing forests of social opportunities and glistening lakes, deep with renewed understanding. 2018 is a year of the journey both physical, mental and spiritual and your view of yourself, life and your possibilities will expand as will your optimism and awareness. 
Virgo will travel more i 
 n 2018 especially by boat and train and in your suitcase you have a wide angle camera lens ready to take in a far broader perspective. You are eager for adventure and also thirsty for knowledge about people, places and how everything fits together. It is about casting yourself into the world and losing yourself as everything opens up into a vast expanse where at times you feel lost, overwhelmed, tiny and insignificant, but where after a while this infinite and mysterious energy draws in on itself creating a stunning, rock hard diamond within your heart that is indestructible and 
 which you can keep forever.” 
 A big thank you to all the amazon and B&N buyers who supported me over the past 4 years and also to my youtube channel subscribers. 
Are you looking in the mirror wondering what 2018 will hold? Do you feel at an important crossroads? Do you need direction or a kick start? Are you wondering 'what now' in terms of love and relationships? How are the Stars lining up for you in 2018? What opportunities can they supply the energy for?
