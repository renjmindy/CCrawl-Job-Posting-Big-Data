 Gaming Industry 
 The United States Department of Justice recently changed their views in regards to the Federal Wire Act of 1961, and with that change of opinion, several states have begun to take steps to implement iGaming in one form or another. At present, only three states have legalized iGaming, but numerous states have begun to explore the issue due to the promise of jobs for their citizens and increased tax revenues for the state. With the growth of iGaming,  new jobs  related to the industry are opening. Today, we take look at some of those jobs. 
 iGaming Security Specialists 
 One of the major concerns surround iGaming in the United States revolved around the security of online games. In addition, the current growth in iGaming is happening at the state level. This means that states have to insure that only residents of those states can access sites. Online security specialists will be needed in order to assure the security of these games. Some states will have these jobs limited by the number of land-based casinos in the state. Other states like Nevada will open their iGaming borders to anyone willing to apply for a permit. Considering that iGaming in the U.S. is in its infancy, the growth potential for these jobs is high. 
 Auxiliary Jobs 
 The growth of iGaming in the United States will bring with it numerous support and auxiliary jobs in relation to the sites being created. The entry level positions that it will create will be customer service jobs in relation to the sites. Every site will need to have staff that answers customer complaints. Even more staff will be required to assist with everyday issues, and act as the face of the company to customers. In addition, these sites will create numerous positions in the area of IT support, web design, SEO, and marketing. Also, each individual site will require a team of people to help keep it updated and properly marketed to the general public. While these jobs may be as high profile as others, the sheer number that will be needed in time will make a significant impact on the  job market . 
 Game Related Jobs 
 An article entitled  Four Job Opportunities in the Online Poker Industry  highlighted the need for poker ambassadors and prop players. To expand this idea, iGaming sites will need prop players and brand ambassadors for many of the games on their site. Prop players are used by sites to keep games alive. Brand ambassadors are used as a public face of a company. You may have noticed how online poker sites of the past have hired pro players to represent them. Future iGaming sites will surely employ the same concept. These sites hope to use the popularity of popular gambling celebrities to draw users to their site. In conclusion, many new jobs have become available with the advancement of technology. One field of these jobs is in iGaming. As a result, many support and auxiliary jobs are now available. Now you know if these jobs are for you.
