 About Whetstone Education 
 Whetstone Education provides a fully customizable classroom observation and evaluation platform that handles the minutia of recording and sorting observation data so teachers and administrators can focus on meaningful professional development and increase student impact. The platform allows school leaders to capture, organize, analyze, and share teacher data in an intuitive interface. No more tracking down paper forms, linking hundreds of formulas and spreadsheets, or searching through years-long email chains. Whetstone lets you put everything in one place, identify teacher trends, and make data-informed decisions to help teachers grow.   Â    Whetstone Education was founded in New Orleans in 2011 by educators looking for an efficient, streamlined way to manage teacher evaluation feedback and data. Through partnership with leading national educators, districts, and school networks, Whetstone has evolved to meet the changing needs of teacher evaluation support a wide variety of instructional development models.
