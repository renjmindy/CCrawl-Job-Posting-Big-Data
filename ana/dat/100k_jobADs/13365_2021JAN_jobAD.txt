  Poll: Is It Better To Be A Job Hopper Or A Long-Timer?  
 Belen Chacon 
 March 18, 2013 
 Are you a  job hopper  or a long-timer? There are many pros to long-term employment. One might argue that there can be a lot of benefits once you’ve reached seniority-level at a company. There’s a sense of stability, it looks good on your resume, and you’re established enough to know how everything in the company works. However, while some people are more comfortable staying at a company for longer periods of time, others have found  benefits in job hopping . Job hopping can allow one to acquire more targeted skills, gaining a variety of experience, and consequently, adding variety to your resume. There’s also opportunity for better pay. In your experience, is it better to job hop or stay at one company for a long time? Please take our poll and tell us what you think in the comment section!
