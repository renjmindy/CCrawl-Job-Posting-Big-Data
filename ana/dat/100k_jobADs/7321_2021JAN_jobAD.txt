  Facebook Career Fairy: Laid Off and Looking for 2+ Years Wish  
 Work It Daily 
 September 05, 2012 
 Being  laid off  once is bad enough, but what about those who have been laid off multiple times? This week, we received the following career wish from one of our Facebook fans: 
 
 
 "Gosh, could I have my wish answered. It has now been more than two years since my last layoff. I say 'last' as I have now been laid off three times, all due to no fault of my own or due to any performance issues, as they have always been very strong. "I have been working the job boards, contacting my 1000+ contacts and close friends on LinkedIn, have found friends in companies where I submitted an application who then gave a strong word for me, and still nothing. I have had a few interviews, but not as many as I think I should get. "It has to be my resume or my cover letter or something else. I will start to focus on networking within my selected target companies, but is there anything I can do to turn things around any faster as this method seems like it will take time for most people? My wife works, but our financial situation is getting too close to shutting down than I can take. Please help!" - Robert
