 What if we approached job search as an adventure? 
 October 8, 2015October 8, 2015 Eileen Kohan 
 Take a minute to search the online dictionaries for a definition of the word 'adventure'. All will include a version of "an _​unusual, ​exciting, and ​possibly ​dangerous ​activity, ​trip, or ​experience, or the ​excitement ​produced by such ​activities ". _What if we approached our job search as an adventure? 
 There are bookcases full of career exploration guides and a plethora of simulation exercises marketed as navigational tools for the job seeker. The industry of career consulting has depreciated the complexity of vocational discovery and led folks to believe that career mysteries can be decoded with minimal effort. 
 It's a cookie cutter approach assuming that we know what jobs are out there and know the skill set required for each. What we also know is that the world @work is volatile and many job titles have been retired along with their occupants and many more have evolved with the emergence of new employers. 
 If you frame your job search as an adventure, your expectations adjust to prepare for the unexpected. Your time frames align with reality. The anticipation of meeting new folks, cataloging what you still need to learn and testing your ambitions @work will catapult you out of bed each morning. 
 Where do you start? Select an individual who is known for their sense of adventure. Focus on the excitement vs. the danger. Why are they successful? 
 " To me, adventure has always been the connections and bonds you create with people when you're there. And you can have that anywhere."   Bear Grylls 
 Start making the connections - scheduling conversations.The adventure is in the discovery of what you don't know about work. It's asking questions, listening and connecting the dots. As you accumulate knowledge, various scenarios begin to emerge in the experience of others. 
 It's a lifetime commitment once you open the door to adventure. 
 "  Remember what Bilbo used to say: ‘It’s a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don’t keep your feet, there’s no knowing where you might be swept off to.””  — J.R.R. Tolkien
