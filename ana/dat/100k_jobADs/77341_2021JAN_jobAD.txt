 Developer Job Offer Letter template 
 This template includes tips on how to optimize your developer job offer letters, a sample job offer email and a sample formal job offer letter for developers. Feel free to customize employment terms, tweak tone and structure or include a personalized message to your potential hire. 
 
 Keep in mind that this template is not a legal document and may not take into account all relevant local or national laws. Please ask your attorney to review your finalized job offer letter. 
 Tips on how to modify this developer job offer template 
 With high demand for software developers projected to increase  much faster than average  in coming years, job ads and offers need to stand out. Here are some tips for modifying this template to create a successful developer job offer letter: 
 
 Talk about your mission.  It’s common for companies to compete for tech talent. When offering a job to your best developer candidate, congratulate them and highlight how they will contribute to the mission of your products and company, especially if you’re a smaller company that is still establishing its brand. 
 Play up your perks . Beyond traditional  employee benefits , like paid vacation days and health insurance, consider offering  perks and benefits popular among developers  and include them in your offer letter. Here are a few ideas:
 
 Flexible working hours 
 Remote work options 
 Tech equipment 
 Professional development 
 Tuition reimbursement 
 Free breakfast, lunch, snacks 
 
 
 Describe your team culture.  Entice your best developer candidates with offer letters that not only explain your terms of employment but also illustrate your company culture. Candidates are more likely to accept your offer if they understand you invest in building a healthy and safe work environment where they have everything they need to be productive. For example, mention:
 
 Your  anti-harassment policies . 
 Your equal opportunity initiatives (e.g. any efforts you take to build diverse teams.) 
 Your office plan (e.g. open spaces for team collaboration, communal areas to interact with coworkers during breaks and private rooms if employees want to work quietly.) 
 
 
 
 Here’s a sample developer job offer email you can use to introduce your formal offer. Customize this template to meet your needs:
