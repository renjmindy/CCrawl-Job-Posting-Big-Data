 Delicious recipes, precise ingredients & a dollop of adventure, delivered to your door. We have invested into our technology, data capability and our product to ensure the customer is at the heart of what we do. Every aspect of our business is powered by our passion. 
 Whether it is innovation through our recipe development, building algorithms to optimise our recipe box journey or devising strategies to reduce plastic and food waste. All our teams play a part in our amazing growth in the UK! 
 Our DREAM? To be the most-loved way to eat dinner, and for every meal to leave the planet better off. Gousto is changing how people shop, cook and eat food at home. It’s an incredibly exciting time to join our team! 
 Principal Data Scientist 
 We have a new opportunity within our Data Science team for a Principal Data Scientist! Our Principal Data Scientist will be a technical lead on Data Science products & projects within our successful Supply Tribe! 
 Our technology & operations are growing faster and more complex than ever before - we will soon have four factories to fulfill our customer orders. With this additional operational complexity comes increased opportunity, and we are seeking a Principal Data Scientist to help us exploit this opportunity and provide first-class technical expertise to develop cutting-edge supply chain algorithms. 
 Our operations, logistics and supply chain are integral to ensuring our customers receive their Gousto box. How we optimise our warehouse, ingredients, resources and customer distribution is key to ensuring the quality and convenience we want our customers to have. 
 As the Principal Data Scientist in Supply, you will have a wealth of experience in developing algorithms to optimise supply chains. You’ll enjoy raising the technical bar of the rest of the team. You’ll be extremely creative in translating supply chain problems into robust and scalable data science products, and will enjoy designing algorithms from first principles as much as you enjoy developing code and delivering products. 
 To be successful and, more importantly, enjoy the role, you will be a natural problem solver as well as passionate about unlocking solutions for our customers through data. 
 Who You Are 
 
 Adventurer in data science - As a leading member of the data science team, you will be using advanced machine learning and optimisation techniques to build tools that will improve our supply chain. We look to our senior team members to unlock new step changes in performance for our existing data products, introduce new theories and technologies to the team and leverage data science in new areas. 
 End-to-end owner of supply chain data products - The problems we pursue are diverse and have a direct impact on the business. They range from optimising flows in our warehouse to algorithmically designing the layouts of each factory. We believe that if you build something, you should run it too. This means that our data scientists take ownership over the entire process from ideation to deployment, as well as automation and maintenance. Knowing our data products inside-out allows us to keep learning and improving. 
 Passionate about impact - We have big plans for the future, hence we are looking for creative thinkers to help drive the business and disrupt the online grocery market by leveraging machine learning and optimisation. You will work with amazing colleagues and look forward to solving challenging problems that will have a significant impact on the product and our customers. You’ll recognise when to meet complex problems with advanced solutions or when a simple approach cuts through all complexity. Most of all, you are excited about Gousto’s mission and product and really enjoy working with the team. 
 Relentlessly raising the bar – We believe that one of the most important things our Principal Data Scientist will do is educate the more junior members of the team. We’re looking for someone who can bring new and innovative practices into the team, someone who is willing to help educate and help to improve what we do on a daily basis. As a senior member of the team, you’re always on the lookout for opportunities to help the team fulfil their potential.
