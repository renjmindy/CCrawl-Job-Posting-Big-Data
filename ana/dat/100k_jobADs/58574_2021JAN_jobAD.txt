 Debunking Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders on Trade and Immigration 
 ](https://libertariancenteroftolerance.wordpress.com/2015/08/30/debunking-donald-trump-and-bernie-sanders-on-trade-and-immigration/) 
 The Dark Horse candidates for the republican and democrat primaries (Donald Trump & Bernie Sanders respectively) have both expressed skepticism of Immigration and Trade in regard to U.S. Wages and Wealth. To me the ignorance that this exemplifies results in promoting a xenophobic sentiment with hostility towards globalization that I find well… offensive. So below I've collected many articles on the topic of Immigration and Trade the benefits they bring the U.S. Economy to settle this debate. 
(For those who havn't noticed Sanders tone on immigration, read this) 
(For the record I support Rand Paul for the republican nomination and in the case he does not get the nomination I support Gary Johnson for the Libertarian Party nomination.)
