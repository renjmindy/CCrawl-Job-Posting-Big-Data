 Hammers hall of fame (Updated) 
 How it all began (updated) 
 
 Grant in line for the technical director's job at Chelsea 
 Avram Grant could be in line for an extraordinary escape route from West Ham United - to Chelsea. 
 Despite some of the despair being lifted from Upton Park by the 3-1 win over Wigan Athletic on Saturday, Grant remains on borrowed time at the east London club. 
 But West Ham's owners have been reluctant to sack Grant - who was only appointed in the summer - until they are sure who should be the new manager. 
 And even then David Gold and David Sullivan, the joint owners, are loathe to axe the Israeli given the cost of compensation. 
 That is why they are considering offering him the post of general manager with Wally Downes, the new assistant coach, having a bigger say on first-team matters. And they are even contemplating calling on Paolo Di Canio, the Hammers legend, to spice up team spirit. 
 Alternatively they could draft in a new senior coach. In any such scenario, Grant would lose control over first-team affairs - which could prompt a legal case against the club. 
 However, it is understood Grant could make a dramatic return to Chelsea as the technical director - now that it has emerged that Frank Arnesen will leave the role when his contract expires in the summer. 
 Now his position has been revealed Chelsea may want to resolve the situation sooner. Grant, who filled the role before temporarily taking over the top job when Jose Mourinho left the club in 2007, is seen as a safe pair of hands.
