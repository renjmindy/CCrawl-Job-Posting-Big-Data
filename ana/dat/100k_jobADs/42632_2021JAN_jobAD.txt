 About United States Army NOLA 
 The Army offer 150+ career fields and several ways to serve. Benefits that last a lifetime- The Army offers you money for education, comprehensive health care, generous vacation time, family services and support groups, special pay and cash allowances to cover the cost of living. Active Duty:  You are a Soldier who serves full time. You will generally live on a base, either within the United States or in a foreign country. While on active duty, you will earn a full salary and you will receive health and retirement benefits. ARMY RESERVE:  You are a part-time Soldier, and unlike active duty status, you are required to train and report for duty just one weekend a month and two weeks a year. Serving in the Army Reserve allows you to live where you want, attend school and work a civilian job. You will still earn many benefits, including health care and retirement, and you will also earn part-time duty pay in addition to the income from your civilian job.  WHAT KIND OF JOB WILL I HAVE? When you make the decision to join the Army, you will take a test called the Armed Forces Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB). Think of it as the Army’s version of the SAT. It’s designed to help the Army understand your skills. Once you complete the test, you’ll be able to choose from a list of Military Occupational Specialties (MOS) that match your qualifications. No matter which career path you choose, the experience you receive in the U.S. Army will give you a framework for success. You will have the opportunity to train and achieve a certification in almost any career path. You will be given hands-on training, and you will be expected to carry more responsibility than you would starting out in a comparable civilian job. You will also gain leadership skills and a work ethic that can only come with a background in the military. This is the Official WorkNOLA page of the Downtown New Orleans Army Recruiting Center. Army Recruiters are tasked with not only finding men and women who are interested in the Army, but also helping them gauge whether military service is best for them.  Recruiters also guide potential candidates through the enlistment process, making sure they have everything they need up until the moment a Soldier embarks on Basic Combat Training. Why contact a Recruiter? A recruiter will help you tailor your Army experience to fit your needs and goals.  Want to take advantage of money for your education? Need certain job skills? Your recruiter can give you the specifics on all the Army benefits to help you make the most out of your Army career. What’s it like talking to a Recruiter? Recruiters are some of the most experienced Soldiers in the Army, and they are qualified to tell you about what the Army has to offer. Some have served overseas, and some have seen combat. You should feel free to ask them about their experiences and how the Army has helped them meet their goals.
