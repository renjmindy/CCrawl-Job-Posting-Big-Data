 What is an aircraft mechanic? 
 Aircraft mechanics maintain and repair aircraft systems and their components. They oversee the operation of various aircraft types, including helicopters and jets. 
 What does an aircraft mechanic do? 
 Aircraft mechanics inspect mechanical, hydraulic and structural systems and diagnose malfunctions. They use power and hand tools (e.g. saws, grinders) to repair aircraft parts.
