  Moving? 3 Helpful Tips For Your Relocation Job Search  
 Helen Evans 
 November 21, 2013 
 Finding work in a new town, city, or state can be the ideal solution to a lack of fulfillment. A relocation job search can be tricky, but it's not impossible. So, with this in mind, what kinds of tips do the experts offer in order to make the process as manageable and straightforward as possible? 
 
 1. Don’t Procrastinate 
 It’s largely inevitable that the process of gaining employment in a different area of the country will take longer and be more of a logistical undertaking than looking to work a few blocks down the road. As such, it’s of huge importance to make sure you don’t stall a minute longer than necessary when it comes to the task of looking for work and getting your applications fired out to those that matter. This counts double if you have already planned your move and would like to start working as soon as you arrive. Of course, it’s perfectly possible to look for  jobs in New Hampshire , California, or wherever you're headed once you’ve arrived, but you could miss out on some golden opportunities. Not only that, but employers across the U.S. are always on the lookout for those that show genuine drive, initiative, and proactivity – all of which you can demonstrate by seeking employment before you go ahead with a move. 
 2. Look Into Local Job Listings 
 Another great tip is to try moving away from those national job search services and online engine for a while. Look into the local job listings of the exact place you’re heading to instead. For example, if you’re heading to Boston, not every job that comes up will make it to the big aggregation engines that can be viewed from New York to L.A. Instead, some of the posts offered by recruiters that are known to be in high demand will only be advertised locally and won’t be seen by long-distance applicants. Also, try to tap into local resources, which could include things like the local government website listing, online local newspapers, and more. And don’t forget that to get into the spirit of local research, as it doesn’t all have to be about the web – there’s always the good old-fashioned phone call to try out. 
 3. Be __ Ready To Network 
 And finally, even after using the very best job search tools in the U.S. and getting yourself truly involved in local career hunting practices, you still need to be aware of the importance of networking. Chances are you know a ton of people who ended up in the jobs they’re in today because of good networking. So, if looking to step out of your own community and into another, head online and you’ll find local community forums and message boards for pretty much every single town, village, and city in the U.S. where you can get yourself known before you even get there. The more people you have on your side, the better your chances of finding the job you’re looking for.  Enjoy this article? You've got time for another! Check out these related articles:
