 What is a teacher assistant? 
 A teacher assistant supports the teacher in planning and presenting lessons, and helps students learn. Teacher assistants may work part-time or full-time. They’re usually required to pass assessments before they can work with students, although a formal university degree may not be always required. 
 What does a teacher assistant do? 
 Teacher assistant duties often depend on their level. For example, a higher-level teacher assistant may be qualified to occasionally replace a teacher in their absence, apart from handling basic administrative tasks. The ages of students could affect the teacher assistant duties, too. For example, if a teacher assistant works at a preschool, they’ll supervise children during play or lunch. But, if they work at a high school, they’ll probably be more focused on creating lesson plans, preparing material for classrooms and assisting with remedial teaching. 
 Also, some teacher assistants work with students with disabilities, assisting  special education teachers . In these cases, teacher assistants may need to provide basic care to students, too, such as help with personal hygiene. 
 Teacher assistant responsibilities include: 
 
 Helping teachers create lesson plans 
 Working with small groups of students to enhance the learning process 
 Making sure classrooms are safe and tidy
