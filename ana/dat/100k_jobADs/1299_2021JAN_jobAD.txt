 Musings on social media and the world as I see it 
 Reignite your passion for your job 
 May 28, 2013  by  Nancy Jean   6 Comments 
 I love what I do. Now. For many years my job was just that -- a job I did for the paycheck. Sure I had a great work ethic, and did as good a job as I possibly could, always. While I did pride myself on being good at what I did, I really didn't get a sense of satisfaction or fulfillment from it, nor did I particularly enjoy what I did even though I did it for decades. 
 Then I discovered the magic of social media. For four years now, I have spent my days, nights and some hours of every weekend focused on learning about, reading up on, interacting with, posting to, and blogging about social networks for marketing. And I've said more times than I can count that for the first time in my career I  love  what I do. 
 Why I LOVE social media 
 There's something about social media that just makes me think that this is what I was meant to do. Unfortunately it wasn't around when my career all started xx number of years ago (too many to say!). But I am living proof that you can teach an old dog new tricks. 
 Maybe it's that there's something new every day to learn and discover. Maybe it's that you can meet countless smart, talented, incredibly helpful people all over the world at any given time. Or maybe it's just I feel like I can connect one-on-one with people, and be helpful rather than represent the people who are caring for people, as I did for almost all of my career. 
 The ho-hums 
 While I know this, and appreciate this every day, sometimes it can get monotonous. Oh yes, it's Memorial Day weekendâ€¦ time to share some healthy barbecue recipes or some safe grilling tips. Or during a winter storm, time to send out some info on avoiding shoveling and snowblower injuries. Every day may bring something different, but your overall strategy really doesn't change and your editorial calendar is usually pretty definite. That is when you might feel a bit of ennui setting inâ€¦ that touch of ho-hum, that "here we go again" feeling. That boredom you can easily forget how much you love your social media job. 
 Reigniting the passion 
 And when you get to that point,  that  is when you need a good kick in the butt to remind you of what it is you love about your job. That's exactly what I got last week. It was as simple as participating in a panel discussion for a group of folks, most of whom are not using social media to market their business. I found myself sitting in this amazing board room with one of the best views of the city of Providence to share some collective expertise with a great group of people from the  Environmental Business Council of New England  (@EBCNE on Twitter) and some panelists who were there to preach what they practice. 
 And that's when the magic kicked in and the passion was reignited. My passion. My excitement for social media and its many uses and how strong a tool it can be when it's used correctly. And hearing what other people are doing and how they're using it. Then hearing people ask questions like "how do you find people to follow on Twitter?" The realization that not everyone is up to speed in this new world of marketing. That makes you understand that some people still don't believe that social media is for them. And all of those things remind you of how amazing this technology is and how exciting it is to be a part of it. 
 Then you hear yourself talking about all the ways it can be used. And you hear the excitement in your voice and you realize how fast you're talking and you see people nodding their heads and just GETTING it. THAT'S when your passion resurfaces and gets reignited and you remember all the things you love about this crazy, constantly changing but always social world of social media. And while public speaking is never something I like to do, when it's able to serve as such an important reminder for me, it's SO worth it. 
 So how do you reignite  YOUR  passion when your days become humdrum?

 I love reading, writing, music, the beach, and being a mom to two rescue dogs. My job is social media for health care.

 And I am very glad you found something you love and transitioned to a new role, too ðŸ™‚ It's hard to maintain a certain level of "love" for our jobs at all times, and it's easy to get bogged down or burned out, but it is such a great feeling when we get excited about our work again after a little lull.

 You're SO sweet! And just thinkâ€¦ if I hadn't transitioned to his role, you'd be in a very different place too! ðŸ˜‰ Thanks for reading, El.
