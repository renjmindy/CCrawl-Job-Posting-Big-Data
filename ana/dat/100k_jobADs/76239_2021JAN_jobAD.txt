 My client, a private equity backed software business with an exciting growth plan requires an accounts receivable and collections manager to replace the existing incumbent who is moving internally. Staff welfare is hugely important to this business as is customer service and with a growing order book the rest of 2020 and 2021 is looking very exciting. This organisation offers flexible working and a number of staff benefits to attract the very best candidates. 
 This role reports to the Financial Controller and has 1 direct report. It is a hands on collections role which involves query resolution and working closely with the account management team. You will be expected to build relationships with external customers and the account management team, introduce payment plans if appropriate and resolve and manage escalations on aged debt. Finally, you will lead the implementation of a daily cashflow forecast model, working with the financial controller and the account management team. 
 The ideal candidate will be experienced at cash collections and building relationships with an internal sales team. A background in developing client relationships and running the credit management function of an sme business is essential. Experience of cash flow forecasting and building simple models in excel would also be useful. You will be a confident individual, motivated to collect cash and reduce debtor days. Finally, experience of working for an IT or services business with some people management skills would be nice to have. 
 This is a super chance to progress your career with a growing, people centric business that has a recognisable brand name. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
