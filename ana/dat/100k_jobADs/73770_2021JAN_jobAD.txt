 PAINT JOB DESIGN FOR BORIS JOHNSON’S PLANE FINALLY REVEALED 
 21st Jun 2020 
 The paint job design for the Prime Ministerial plane used by Boris Johnson has finally been revealed, and it’s causing one “ell” of a row. 
 The grey RAF Voyager, currently parked up in Cambridgeshire for its makeover, is to be decorated with two giant-sized L-plates, one on each side. 
 A shifty-looking Downing Street spokesman explained the reasoning behind the controversial design, which is set to cost the taxpayers over £900,000: “It should be pretty clear to everyone by now that Boris is still trying to get the hang of this whole Prime Minister thing, so the L-plates will serve as a warning to other heads of state who happen to be in the air that they need to give him a bit of a wide berth.” 
 So will the new design have any effect on the flying-capabilities of the plane in question? 
 “Well, we are expecting it to make considerably more U-turns than it used to. Ha ha! See what I did there? See what I did?” 
 And how long are the L-plates expected to stay on before Boris becomes fully qualified, as it were? 
 “I’ll get back to you on that one,” said the spokesman.
