 Another lesson from Job 
 Posted on  September 12, 2020  by  Pastor Jim Dixon 
 When I began this book a few days ago, I admitted to God that I had trouble with Job, and asked Him to help me understand. He’s certainly answered that request. Having read, now through Job chapter 23. Job is bitter, blaming God for his circumstances. I keep coming back to the same question: “What if…?” The lesson I’m learning from Job is that when life throws you a curve ball continue to worship God and don’t compare your circumstances with others’. Don’t blame God for what the devil is responsible. Don’t try to defend yourself to God, or to your well-meaning friends who don’t understand what you’re going through and condemn you for your reaction. Above all, pray that God, who loves you, is for you and not against you, will deliver you from your situation. He knows the end from the beginning. And, ultimately, He will give you victory. Romans 8:18, “In my opinion,whatever we have to go through is next to nothing compared to the magnificent future God has in store for us.” (Philips translation) 
 Though God gave satan permission to attack Job, in reality it was Adam and Eve who opened the door for evil to enter into the world. Praise God, that door was closed when the tomb was opened!
