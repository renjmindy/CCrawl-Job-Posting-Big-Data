 I can relate so much on this post. If you dream to be a celebrity one day, it's not enough that your handsome nor beautiful. Even the talent will not send you to the top. An expert once said that being on the top of television industry, it's either you have it or not. That means, if you feel like you have what it takes to be in this industry, you just have to work hard! Be the best version of yourself and one day you will realize you have reached the status you've been dreaming to reach!
