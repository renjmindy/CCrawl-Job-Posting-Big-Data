 Tom Jobim Statue at Arpoador sidewalk 
 Last december, a statue in the honor of Tom Jobim, the brazilian composer, famous for his bossa nova songs, like "Garota de Ipanema" (Girl from Ipanema) was inaugurated in Arpoador sidewalk. 
 The sculpture is in life-size and was crafted by the artist Christina Motta, the same artist who did the Brigitte Bardot statue in BÃºzios. 
 It is another nice point for pictures when visiting Arpoador beach! 
 Have a nice weekend!!!
