 Social Media Jobs in India 
 
Image by  markhillary  via Flickr 
 Ever since the Web2.0 wave has caught up in India there has been a tremendous shift ! Shift in our thinking, our perception and the way we have looked towards internet & its capabilities. If you talk about an average business owner, he is looking very carefully at the dynamics of Web2.0 [conversations,  community , culture, collaboration]. Irrespective of the domain he is trying to tap on its potential an learn from this medium. 
 However he knows that before making a leap and jumping into the pool, his brand needs an expert advice for creating a successful strategy. 
 
 For building a strategy you need helping hands, you need the 'services' of experts who can understand your needs to the core and guide you. This is where different schools of thought come-in. 
 
 The conservatives 
As a business owner, I believe that I have an understanding of the  Web 2.0  platform, I know what I need to do and where I need to go.I don't think we need a specialist position or assistance from an agency/consultant for this. 
 The Street-smarts 
I don't think we have the in-house capabilities to drive our entire web2.0-strategy for us. I think it is best if we discuss our problems with an expert media agencies. The only compromise is in this case 
 The Futurists 
I understand that I need to engage in healthy conversations for my brand and I think we need to hire chaps who can help us in doing just this. I might go in for one guy or a team of individuals depending on what my goals are. I don't think agency will best serve our case as their perception will always be external. On the flip-side, if we have people are deeply engaged in our daily organizational activities they will certainly execute the plans in a much better way. 
 So which roles are these and what do these guys need to do? Lets have a look at some real job-descriptions from some Indian companies: **

 Social-media  specialist [ via Jobs India ] 
 What does he do? 
 As a Social Media Specialist, you will be responsible for  marketing  and socialization of our client’s online content. Familiarity with the internet, social media sites,  search engines , discussion boards, blogs, video sharing sites and pod casting is an asset but a willingness to learn is essential. You must possess excellent written and verbal communication skills in order to write and edit high quality content. A background in interactive marketing or public relations is considered a plus. The ability to find solutions in order to generate measurable results for clients is necessary as well as the generation of reports on those efforts. 
 Social-media marketing/campaign strategist [[via Naukri.com](Social Media Marketing / Campaign Strategis)] 
 
 Conceptualize the innovative social media solutions to increase traffic to the web sites / portals 
 Define strategy to improve end user involvement through Social Networks 
 Define the avenues of revenue generation through increased and focused traffic 
 Provide valuable insight and strategy for social media campaigns 
 
 **Community Manager 
** 
 
 I think this is one role that is evolving quite well. In bits-nd-pieces you will see some roles in the organization that are performing some actions from this role. Earlier this year,  I had talked about the job-description and the need for Community manager at length.  
 
 Job-description [ via a web portal ] 
 
 Growing membership and site traffic 
 Designing and executing marketing initiatives 
 Working with members to make them successful 
 Finding members to contribute content to the communities 
 Contributing product ideas 
 
 Not to forget the traditional roles of SEO analysts and Online marketers. 
 What is your take on this? Please do share other roles that I did miss? In the Indian context do you think we'll see more such roles in the future?

 A good article. Online Social Media Network positions are an 'opening level'. Though as you rightly mention that it is still 'developing'. However the space is wide and can be a good career option.

 Apart from giving opportunities to a particular level of professionals . Social networking has also opened door of employment for a various segements of people. 
As you have mentioned that to start such social networking sites/jobs sites they need a strategy to follow. After all these if any business is on web , it is very necessary to have most exposure get better ROI. 
 For bringing customers and visitors to such web 2.0 sites there is a great task performed by various of peoples, like marketing, advertisements,link building, search engine optimization, databased management,subscribers management, feedsand news managements.

 I have learned a lot by reading sites like this and believe it or not you can view video on some of the job board sites. The one I like and take notes on is  http://www.newmediahire.com  from the videos. They don't have many jobs in India BUT I have seen some and some who will sponsor. You can also try looking at some HubPages and type in Social Media. 
 SOcial media has really helped people communicate and learn each other between FaceBook and Twitter.com you learn and interact no matter where you are in the world!
