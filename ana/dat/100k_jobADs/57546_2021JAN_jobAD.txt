 The HPC Sr. Engineer will serve the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) and its patients within the Computational Solutions team under the Chief Health Information Office. The successful candidate supports production grade development and operation of computational workloads such as NGS pipelines within a high-performance computing (HPC) environment. 
 Cancer is a disease of the genome; effectively fighting cancer will depend on the successful application of genomics to the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. A significant component of our HPC environment is devoted to our strategic Cancer Genomics program, encompassing centers such as CCGD and programs such as PROFILE in collaboration with Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital, to facilitate genome discoveries in human cancer through basic and translational research and generation of reports of medically actionable genetic alterations in a CLIA-certified laboratory. These cancer genomic profiles are being used to guide patient treatment and/or stratification for clinical trials of novel anticancer agents. 
 The role requires a strong technical background with hands-on experience in bringing a research computational pipeline from prototype to production with regards to error handling, stability, reliability, usability, scalability and performance. The process may include refactoring of existing code and redesign of how data is processed in a scalable HPC environment. The ideal candidate understands how hardware and software go hand in hand and only the ideal combination of compute resources and software components deliver the optimal result; can take a prototype computational workload off a scientistâ€™s computer and run it productively on HPC resources. 
 Located in Boston and the surrounding communities, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute brings together world renowned clinicians, innovative researchers and dedicated professionals, allies in the common mission of conquering cancer, HIV/AIDS and related diseases. Combining extremely talented people with the best technologies in a genuinely positive environment, we provide compassionate and comprehensive care to patients of all ages; we conduct research that advances treatment; we educate tomorrow's physician/researchers; we reach out to underserved members of our community; and we work with amazing partners, including other Harvard Medical School-affiliated hospitals.
