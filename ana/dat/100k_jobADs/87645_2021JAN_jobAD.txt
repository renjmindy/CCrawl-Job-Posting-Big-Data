  My Job as an Online Marketing Professional

 June 29, 2012 
 This is a true story as told to JustJobs Academy  which houses career interviews and job search advice for professionals in any industry.Visit to read about how to  be precise  and  tame your ego  on the job.  I have done internet marketing part-time for the past ten years. Last year, I made the move to become a full-time internet  marketing professional . Some people automatically thought I was trying out some kind of pyramid selling scheme when I told them I was making money online in my spare time. Now that I do online marketing full-time, some of the same people are asking me to show them how to do it. My work has nothing to do with pyramid schemes, but it isn't as easy as people think either. Some of the things I do to make money online include creating websites, writing content, updating social media sites, and promoting online products and services.  1. Creating Websites  - Most of the time, the websites I create are for myself. In addition, sometimes I will set up a site for a small business that wants an online presence.  2. Writing Content  - There are a lot of website owners online who are looking for people to write for them. I do occasional jobs through Fiverr, but most of my work is from higher paying clients who want articles or blog posts on their site. Other people pay me to create information products they can sell online.  3. Updating Social Media Sites  - When I write website content for someone, I always offer to create and update a Facebook and Twitter page for them for an additional fee. Lots of places know they should have a social media presence, but they don't really know how to get started or keep it updated.  4. Promoting Online Products and Services  - A lot of the money I make as a marketing professional comes from being an affiliate of various companies. That means the company pays me a commission. Three of the programs that pay the most consistently for me are Google Adsense, Amazon, and TangoWire. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate my job satisfaction as a 7. When things are going the way they should, this  job  is wonderful. The problem for me is having to rely on other people for payment. I am working toward diversifying what I do online so that I am not overly reliant on one person or marketing method to make money. Some aspects of being an internet marketing professional are amazing. The best part is that I have a lot of freedom. My hours are really flexible, and I get to be home with my family. If we want to take a road trip, I can work from anywhere I can pick up a WiFi signal on my laptop. My previous job as an elementary school teacher helped me keep up with the research and writing skills I use as a marketing professional. The other people I know in this profession come from a wide variety of backgrounds. I think the only thing we all have in common is a drive to have the freedom that comes from working for yourself. When I got started back in 2001, there were not as many opportunities to make money online. The first thing I did was get paid a few pennies for each website I visited on this network. I only made around $20 that first month, but I was so excited. The first "real" money I made as a marketer was by promoting a dating site through TangoWire. You could use your own domain and were paid half of the money from anyone who opted for a paid membership. That and other affiliate programs brought me up to several hundred dollars a month. In order to go full-time, I added writing and website work to the mix. Between affiliate marketing and those services, I was able to replace the income from my  teaching job . Now that I am working online full-time, I have met a lot of very successful marketers. They all have one thing I don't - a list of past customers. The people with the biggest lists can make money each day just by sending out a new promotion. If I were to go back and do anything differently, I would have started my list years ago. I do love working as an internet marketer, and if I'm not careful, I could end up being on the computer from the moment I wake up until the moment I go to sleep. When I notice I am spending too much time online, I have to stop and set up a schedule that allows me to make the best use of my time. Working as a marketing professional online gives me the freedom I have always wanted. Now it is up to me to make the most of that freedom by spending quality time with the people I love.
