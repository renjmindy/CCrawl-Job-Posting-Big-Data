 How To Shift Out Of A Career That Bores You 
 0 Comments 
 Read More 
 I'm sure at one point you enjoyed your work. It was interesting and fulfilling and perhaps that magic is now gone. 
 Before you elect to throw in the towel and leave your career, consider a small shift. 
 Your hard-earned expertise can be used to consult or coach. I have friends who were burnt out on their real estate business and now have a real estate education company. I have other friends who were Chiropractors and now coach newbie Chiropractors. 
 So, before you ditch that career, consider shifting into other aspects of your business and see if that lights you up in a whole new way.
