 Since you went away… 
 Urgh…sorry for being away for so long, but, the deadline at my  job  got in the way. Yep, that's right, the Yeti has a  freelance gig  and it's looking like it might turn into something kinda steady, so, I might not be blogging as much as I normally do. But, rest assured, I still got lots of great stories to tell here too. I mean, hell, I haven't even started telling you about our adventures in  NYC  last month. 
 Well, I guess I  started …but, trust me, the flight there was nothing compared to some of the epic  toddler blow-outs  we had in the city. Wow, every year we travel it's like we're vacationing with a  new kid . I guess we kinda are, but, man, what a difference a year makes…for better and for worse! 
 Anyway, will get to all that good stuff in the next few posts. But, for now, I wanted to share one of my favorite quotes from the  DNC  in Charlotte last week. It's something  Joe Biden  said about the importance of jobs. And seeing as everyone I know is having some job drama right now…some are losing them, some can't find them and many of us are between them…I thought what he said was really powerful. So, here goes: 
 " A job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your place in the community. It's about being able to look your children in the eye and say: 'Honey, it's going to be OK.' and mean it, and know it's true." 
 Damn straight, brother! Wow, I just loved that. But, hey, I kinda dug that creepy  Clint Eastwood  and his empty chair bit at the  RNC  too, so, I guess I'm a sucker for political theater. 
 Either way, it's good to be back, I missed you guys…
