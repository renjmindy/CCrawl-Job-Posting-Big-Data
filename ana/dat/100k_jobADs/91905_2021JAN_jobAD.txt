 Three perfect Steve Jobs nuggets on source

 This  video  show Jobs in action as he starts his second company,  NeXT . 
 Here are three clips which serve as brilliant examples of the source principles in action. 
 Jobs on the role of source. The importance of one person holding the overall vision. 
 Recognising the seed of the idea which then grows and blossoms into something large. 
 Everything has a beginning, then more and more people are recruited in to take responsibility for realising part of the vision. 
 How money becomes a drain when you focus on it, rather than the vision. 
 Notice the energy level in the room as the budget is discussed. NeXT (being discussed in this clip) started with millions in capital and ultimately failed, yet Apple started with almost nothing and was a huge success. Perhaps the relationship to money was a factor in NeXT's failure.
