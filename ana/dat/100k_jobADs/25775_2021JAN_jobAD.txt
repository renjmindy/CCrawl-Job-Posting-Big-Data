 30 Years Of Change: A New Direction For Pittsburgh 
 
 English: Downtown Pittsburgh (Photo credit: Wikipedia) 
 Morphing from steel industry collapse to eds-and-meds rebirth, from a too-gray place that young people flee to one that attracts them as a "green" center of culture and recreation, from a tale of Rust Belt woe to one of urban transformation, it is indisputable that the  Pittsburgh  region is a far different place than it was 30 years ago. 
 And by most standards, it would seem to be a far better place as well. 
 Since 1983, when the  Pittsburgh Post-Gazette  published a special section chronicling the unique and worrisome issues confronting the region during Depression-level hits to its workforce, Pittsburgh has lost people, corporations, churches, schools and, yes, even a prothonotary. 
 B  ut it has rebuilt its economy; added museums, theaters and riverfront trails; replaced its sports facilities, airport and convention center; and reinvented the  Pittsburgh Downtown  as a place to live, while serving the thousands more who commute to it by opening a subway, busways and a highway to the north.

 Study: Pennsylvania Income Gap Grew During The Last Decade

 HARRISBURG, PA  —  Pennsylvania 's richest citizens pulled away from the state's poorest during the go-go 1990s, and that trend continued as the bottom began to drop out of the economy, a new study concludes. 
 Between the late 1990s and early 2000s, the annual incomes of the richest fifth of state households grew by 7.2 percent, or $11,190, to $269,400 while the poorest fifth saw their average income fall nearly 8 percent, or $1,907, to $23,000. 
 Income inequality also grew between upper and middle-income families in the state.  Middle-income  families saw their earnings rise by just 1.9 percent between the late 1990s, compared to 7.2 percent for the richest fifth and 11.2 percent for the richest 5 percent of households, the study concluded.
