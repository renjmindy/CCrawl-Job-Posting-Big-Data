 What is a laborer? 
 General laborers are workers who take up various supporting tasks in warehouses, construction sites or other settings (e.g. factories). According to this general laborer definition, these workers may have an important assisting role in constructing highways, buildings or other structures, and they may also transport materials and equipment. 
 What does a laborer do? 
 General laborer duties vary depending on the setting they work in and their level of specialization. They usually work in construction where they help erect scaffolding, clean up sites and assist specialized workers such as painters and electricians. Occasionally, general laborers take up dangerous tasks like handling chemicals or removing lead from buildings. In these cases, you might be required to schedule training sessions on working with hazardous materials safely. 
 General Laborer job duties include: 
 
 Cleaning up worksites from debris and machinery 
 Helping erect scaffolding and ladders 
 Handling and transporting materials (e.g. cement) 
 
 As for general laborer qualifications, there usually aren’t any educational requirements, but formal or informal apprenticeships via unions or contractors are common. Critical general laborer skills also include stamina, ability to follow instructions and commitment to safety.
