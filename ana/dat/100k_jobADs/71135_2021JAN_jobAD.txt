 Senior Management Accountant - Coventry- £43 - 48k + Private healthcare & Bonus. 
 If you a enjoy a mundane, repetitive and steady management accounting position. This one wont be for you. 
 I am working with a large Utilities provider with a head office based in Coventry who are looking for Qualified Accountants to join their Management Accounting function. The role will take responsibility for a specific cost centre, manage a part qual and start to get behind the numbers. 
 The finance function are 40/50 strong and need individuals who want a varied position, where cost savings and improvements to current processes will be welcomed and implemented. The team are all fairly relaxed and enjoy a grown up and autonomous culture. 
 This is a great opportunity for an Accountant who wants to "get behind" the numbers and make a real impact. The role will have a focus on providing detailed analysis on spend, overheads and insight into cost reduction whilst still offering a premium service. The right person for this role will be a confident management accountant who is wants to gradually move away from month end and develop a business partnering role. 
 Previous management experience would be great, however, not essential as the aim will be to develop a junior to takeover from this position, leaving the Senior Management Accountant to be out there, building relationships and driving change. The aim is that this roles involvement in month end will be the final days of reviewing. 
 The role has become available due to the current incumbent has moved into the Finance Business Partnering team and demonstrates progression opportunities are available for hungry individuals. 
 Package on offer: 
 
 £43,000 - £48,000 
 Bonus 
 18% Pension 
 Fleix hours 
 25 days holiday
