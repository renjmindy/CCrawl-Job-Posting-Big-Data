The Bottom of a Bottle 
 Trust me, I've been there, I've looked, I've searched and I know now, that there are no answers to be found in the bottom of a bottle or on the edge of a blade! Fighting Hard, Recovering, Rebuilding, REBORN. Moving on from addiction to a new life.

 The Circle (Job 11:18)

 The Circle (Job 11:18) 
 I’ve sat within the circle 
 Surrounded by only fear 
 I felt the circle close in 
 Until the fear choked my lungs 
 Still the Lord came to my side 
 And tore the walls of fear down 
 In His presence I could breathe again 
 My heart felt so secure 
 Now I’m at the centre of hope 
 All around me is His love 
 And here I rest in the midst of it all 
 Safe here beneath His wings 
 
 Job 11:18
