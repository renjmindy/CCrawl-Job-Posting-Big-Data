 30 Companies Add Over 2200 Quality Jobs to Reno and One of Them Has Your Name on It 
 30 Companies Add Over 2200 Quality Jobs to Reno and One of Them Has Your Name on It

 Despite the Pandemic, Northern Nevada brings diverse industries to fuel economic recovery. In fact, 30 new companies added over 2200 quality jobs to the Reno area in 2020 and we think one of them has your name on it. ( source ) These companies will add a combined 2,295 new jobs, at an average wage of $28, with eleven new corporate headquarters. 
 This kind of job growth is unique to the Reno-Sparks area during a pandemic year where most communities are experiencing significant employment challenges. What is especially rewarding is to see the continuation of efforts to diversify the economy with a real emphasis on advanced manufacturing and technology, which made up the bulk of these new and expanding companies.  It’s this mix of technology, manufacturing, health & medical, e-commerce, and distribution that are all critical to strengthening our economy and our future. 
 The companies would normally be recognized at EDAWN’s “New and Expanded Companies Welcome Reception,” but in light of the pandemic, the event was cancelled. Below are the companies, descriptions, job numbers, location information. We've also added links to their jobs page so you can apply directly. In cases where companies are relocating the jobs page may no be available yet but we encourage you to keep checking with them directly.
