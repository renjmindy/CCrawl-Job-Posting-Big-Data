 Open Job Offer to Prince Harry and Meghan 
 Posted on  January 9, 2020January 14, 2020  by  Mike Lafferty 
 Dear Prince Harry and Meghan, 
 I would like to congratulate you both on your decision to become financially independent in the next chapter of your life and to extend a job offer to both of you that will make your financial dreams a reality. 
 First, you would have to move to Vero Beach, Florida. We have Polo and we don't have a state tax which will be very important in your financial freedom. Second, you will need to enroll in a local Real Estate Sales course (just like everyone else that moves to FL). Now, as the Broker of The Lafferty Group Real Estate & Consulting I can offer to help you out. Because your sphere of influence is very upscale I would be willing to pay for your classes and your dues to the Realtors Association of Indian River County which covers the State and National Dues. Approximate cost is about $3,000. You can pay me back from you first commission check which will come fast if you work your sphere of influence hard enough. Our commission split is 80/20 meaning you get 80% of all your sales and we only charge you $45 each quarter for E&O insurance. You won't have to do any floor time and I can get some of our other sales associates to let you do some of their open houses so you can get some first hand client contact. 
 I hope you will consider this offer and I look forward to helping "Team Royal" become financially independent as fast as possible. 
 Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you soon. 
 Mike Lafferty
