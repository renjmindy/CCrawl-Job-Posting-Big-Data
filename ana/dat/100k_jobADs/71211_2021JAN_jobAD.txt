 Job Card Update for Workshop Software 
 We have had a lot of feedback about the look and feel of the Job Card and have received great ideas on how to improve it. 
 Once again, we've delivered on that feedback to provide you with a new Job Card that has much better laid out information, more details, plus sections for you to write in some information applicable to the job. 
 The efficiency we gain by making small improvements to our business add up to massive gains over time. By providing you with an even better Job Card will mean that you'll be able to be even more streamlined and get the job done more accurately and quicker. This all means money in your pocket at the end of the day! 
 We even have a couple more ideas on how to make it even better (keep an eye out for these improvements coming soon). We would also love your feedback, and we have created a feedback form with one simple question. Would love you to invest just a minute or two by clicking here:  https://workshopsoftware.com/job-card-options-feeback/ 
 Here is what the new Job Card looks like: 
 “After using the software for a month with the Quickbooks integration, we can see that keeping up with parts and records is much easier. The integration helps up with knowing what is going on in the Workshop. Workshop Software is good.”
