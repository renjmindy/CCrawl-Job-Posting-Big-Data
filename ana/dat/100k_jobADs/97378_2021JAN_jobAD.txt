 Aplicación compatible con Android y Ios (en inglés) 
 Published: 1 hour ago  Bids: 0 
 Se necesita realizar una aplicación móvil; estos son los detalles: 
 - App made in the technology that runs on android and iOS. 
- In general i'd love it to be as simple and intuitive as possible. 
 The idea: 
PhaseUs is an app that connects couples during different phases of the female's menstrual cycle. Both partners receive notifications referring to the particular cycle phase which help them understand the circumstances and needs of those phases and giving them helpful tips. 
 Subsequent steps (screens) to illustrate the navigation from the moment of the app download: 
 1 - welcome screen with all the necessary links (Privacy Policy and Terms of Use consents). 
 2 - get reminders and hints about your cycle phases. PhaseUs will help you and your partner with better communication during different phases of your menstrual cycle (+Agree button) 
 3 - (3 sliding screens with texts as below on the bottom half of the screen and an animated relevant graphics on top half of the screen) 
3a - PhaseUs is the first app that connects couples during different phases of the female's menstrual cycle 
3b - Both you and your partner share the app 
3c - PhaseUs will send you notifications with helpful tips referring to the particular cycle phase 
3d - Understand yourself better than ever and share this with your partner 
3e - Enjoy helpful tips and expert articles on your cycle and the best approach both you and your partner can take for a better mutual understanding. 
(+Next button) 
 4 - Choose your plan 
30 day free trial 
(or) 
1 month PLN .. 
 Try free 
(or) 
Provide payment details (->form for payment details) 
 5 - Date of your last period (calendar to tap and choose the first day and number of days of the period) 
(when selected, a popup appears) Log 3 previous periods here to make our predictions accurate. 
(Next button) 
 6 - Phases of your current cycle (4 cycle phases: menstruation, the follicular phase, ovulation and the luteal phase marked on the X axis; letter "i" above each phase name with the brief information on them) 
 7 - Share PhaseUs with your partner. 
 - Adding partner to the app by scanning the (qr?) code from the app downloaded by the female, or the sms link if the partner doesn't have the qr scanning app and doesn't want to download it, then - enter your phone number screen. 
 - Logging through Facebook. 
 - If 2 people already have the app, one can view the code and the other can scan it with the app. 
 - A special link that the app supports and pairs with the person who sends the link. 
 - Or maybe it would be possible to send a link that: 
a) if there is no application installed -> opens the app store / google play, downloads the application and immediately pairs with this person, 
b) if there is an application -> pairs with this person.) 
 8 - App usage 
MVP is one screen with an X axis graph of the cycle and its successive phases + possibility (for a woman) to select symptoms in each of the 4 phases of the cycle plus matching notifications (I have them all listed) 
The man will have a graph plus notifications for each day of each phase along with directions based on the symptoms he or she reports (each symptom is a different clue for him - I also have them listed). 
 9 - tell your friends about PhaseUS 
- invite your friends, send link by sms, FB messenger, email 
- share on social media 
 Possible further steps to enrich the app: 
- enriching the app with dietary and psychological advice (what to provide the body in subsequent phases of the cycle so that it runs as calmly as possible, natural methods of reducing stress, etc. 
- possibility to connect and import cycle data from the currently used cycle tracking app 
- version for lesbian couples
