 THE COMPANY 
 Urban was founded in late 2014 by Jack and Giles and they had a simple mission. 
 "To provide the world easy and affordable access to wellness, so people can live happier and healthier every day." 
 To achieve this mission, we place our community of wellness practitioners at the heart of everything we do. We empower them with everything they need in order to build a thriving business with Urban. In practice, we provide them with a marketplace to meet local customers, business software to manage their work and a community they can belong to. 
 Our humble beginnings started off with massage therapy, since late 2014, we've delivered 650K+ treatments in London, Paris, Manchester and Birmingham. Urban has three offices across London, Paris and Vilnius. 
 In late 2018, we took our accumulated learnings, expanded beyond massage and introduced new services. We now offer mind-body, beauty and fitness services at-home, in the workplace, with partners and online.
