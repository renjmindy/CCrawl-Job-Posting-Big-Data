 Position Summary 
 We are currently seeking Community Health Workers to join our team in Fernie Home Support.  Are you dedicated to delivering patient-centered care? Are you looking for a flexible work schedule? If the answer is 'yes' then we want to hear from you!As a Community Health Worker, you will work as part of a dynamic team of Nurses and LPNs who support Community Clients’ independence and ability to stay at home. Community Health Workers provide home support services to clients, by assisting with personal care and daily living, while promoting maximum independence. Community Health Workers are key players in the home health care plan for each client. 
 Typical duties include: 
• Activities of daily personal care, such as bathing, dressing, grooming and oral hygiene 
• Household duties related to maintaining a safe and healthy environment in the home 
• Meal preparation in accordance with designated plans 
• Assistance with mobility and transfers 
• Observing and reporting changes in client behaviour and condition 
• Performing delegated tasks according with training and procedures 
 This is a Casual opportunity providing Home Support to the Fernie and South Country regions. Casual means there are no guaranteed hours and work requirements may vary to a maximum of 40 hours per week. Services are provided in the community between the hours of 07:00 and 22:00, seven days per week, so shifts may fall anywhere in that timeframe. 
 For people with certain health issues, age-related limitations or other disabilities, managing everyday tasks can be challenging. The support that we provide through the Home Support program enables clients to recover or simply remain at home rather than in a hospital or care facility – in many cases our visits can be the highlight of their day! If you are looking for an opportunity to do meaningful work while joining a great team, then Fernie Health Centre is for you.  Apply today! 
 Interior Health strives to create an environment where you enjoy the work you do, the place where you work, and the people around you. Everyone plays a role in the care continuum.
