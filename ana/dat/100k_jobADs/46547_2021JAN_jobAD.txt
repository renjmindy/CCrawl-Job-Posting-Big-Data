 ‚ÄúHe that takes truth for his guide, and duty for his end, may safely trust to God‚Äôs providence to lead him aright.‚Äù - Blaise Pascal. "There is but one straight course, and that is to seek truth and pursue it steadily" ‚Äì George Washington letter to Edmund Randolph ‚Äî 1795. We live in a ‚Äúpost-truth‚Äù world. According to the dictionary, ‚Äúpost-truth‚Äù means, ‚Äúrelating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.‚Äù Simply put, we now live in a culture that seems to value experience and emotion more than truth. Truth will never go away no matter how hard one might wish. Going beyond the MSM idealogical opinion/bias and their low information tabloid reality show news with a distractional superficial focus on entertainment, sensationalism, emotionalism and activist reporting ‚Äì this blogs goal is to, in some small way, put a plug in the broken dam of truth and save as many as possible from the consequences‚Äîtemporal and eternal. "The further a society drifts from truth, the more it will hate those who speak it." ‚Äì George Orwell ‚ÄúThere are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what isn‚Äôt true; the other is to refuse to believe what is true.‚Äù ‚Äï Soren Kierkegaard
