 Life Tip #26 
 May 18, 2019June 20, 2019  /  Kurt M Borne  /  Leave a comment

If you settle for the job or career of least resistance, you’ll never be fully satisfied …  Continue reading Life Tip #26

  Life Tip #65 
 March 22, 2019June 23, 2019  /  Kurt M Borne  /  Leave a comment

When we were a very young couple, my wife and I were more than a little tempted by various schemes, including selling health supplements and peddling medical billing services. Thankfully, we turned these schemes down before it was too late. If you are …  Continue reading  Life Tip #65

 Life Tip #28 
 March 8, 2019June 20, 2019  /  Kurt M Borne  /  Leave a comment 
 Your employer doesn’t want you to pursue your dreams. Thaaaat’s right, your employer doesn’t want you to strike out on your own to chase your dreams, because that means they will lose your skills and experience, and then have to hire and train a whole new employee. Nor do they don’t want word to get …  Continue reading Life Tip #28

 Life Tip #101 
 January 18, 2019June 20, 2019  /  Kurt M Borne  /  Leave a comment 
 Newsflash—it’s not the president’s fault. If you ever need a “kick in the pants” version of motivation on self-sufficiency, check out Gary Vaynerchuck on social media. He is one of the many people whose videos and podcasts I listen to on my pre-dawn walks. He’s a social media marketing guru and just an overall inspiration …  Continue reading Life Tip #101

 Life Tip #202 
 January 1, 2019June 20, 2019  /  Kurt M Borne  /  Leave a comment 
 Write your own script. Don’t let others, or circumstances, or your past set the agenda for your future. Don’t let your mom, or your dad, a friend, or a sibling write it for you. Don’t even let your significant other write it for you (although I strongly suggest that you include your significant other in …  Continue reading Life Tip #202

 Life Tip #247 
 October 25, 2018May 6, 2019  /  Kurt M Borne  /  Leave a comment 
 What motivates us in our career moves? Let’s start with that. Do we allow the base desire for “more money” determine our career path, from a materialistic and worldly mindset? Do we choose our career simply for status, to feel more important? Does a need for approval drive our career choice? Approval from friends, parents, …  Continue reading Life Tip #247

 Changing my Tune on Millennials 
 August 6, 2018December 28, 2018  /  Kurt M Borne  /  Leave a comment 
 For a while there I was like many Gen Xers who piled on "those lazy Millennials." But the more I observe them, I find myself changing my opinion of them. First it was the generalization that Millennials are shunning the old notions of big-ticket property ownership. You know, cars and houses. As I murmured "phthth" under …  Continue reading Changing my Tune on Millennials

 Posted on September 25, 2017 by Kurt Borne No matter your opinion on the current NFL Players vs. National Anthem debate, I think the far bigger question is, “Why do we spend so many hours helping to fulfill the dreams of others?” Those others being the overpaid players and coaches living their dreams on the …  Continue reading Fulfilling Other People’s Dreams

 By Kathryn Buschman Vasel at Money Tree January 30, 2014 Turns out, the skills and education recent college graduates acquired during their time on campus might not be serving them well when it comes to proving their worth to potential employers. “Soft skills have deteriorated more than hard skills in the view of CEOs and recruiters …  Continue reading The Skills Employers Wish College Grads Had

 Resolving to Help Others See a Bigger Picture 
 January 1, 2013December 28, 2018  /  Kurt M Borne  /  Leave a comment
