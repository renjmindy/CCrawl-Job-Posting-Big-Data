  76% Of CAREEREALISM Readers Want To Know More About Recruiters  
 Work It Daily 
 July 21, 2015 
 Hampton, N.H. (July 20th, 2015)  - CAREEREALISM, a career advice and recruiter brand site, today published the results of its 2015 Recruiter brand survey, through which its audience of 1M+ monthly readers were polled. We collected more than 500 responses from our readers. Readers were prompted to tell us if they were more likely to apply for a job if they knew more about the company recruiter. According to the results, 76% of those readers said they would be more likely to apply to a job if they knew more about the company recruiter. This shows how their sophistication in job search means recruiters MUST build their own brands. Further data from CAREEREALISM’s 1M readers revealed the following:: 
 
 89% are looking for a job this year 
 94% would find it helpful to have a Recruiter Directory that featured recruiter profiles 
 33% said that the hardest thing to find during a job search is the contact information of hiring teams 
 22% said the hardest thing to find was insight into the company culture 
 
 “Job boards are dead,” said Founder & CEO of CAREEREALISM, J.T. O’Donnell. “They’re being replaced by a more interactive approach to finding work. Job seekers are sophisticated consumers who know the right way to find work is to connect directly with people who can influence the hiring process. Recruiters have an opportunity to use this to their advantage. By building up their own professional credibility, a/k/a their recruiter brand, they can differentiate themselves and attract the attention of the top talent they seek.” Recruiter branding will be the single most important tactic companies can use to fill their jobs in the coming year.
