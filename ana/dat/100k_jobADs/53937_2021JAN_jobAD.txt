 Resume Got Us a Job in 4 Days! 
 We are new first-time Workampers who were concerned about getting a job for the winter.  We utilized your Awesome Applicants Resume Builder (in the spring), posted the resume on your website and emailed it to 12 campgrounds on Wednesday night who had advertised in your magazine or online. We received about 15 phone calls by the weekend and accepted our first Workamping position in AZ for the winter season on Sunday!  What a great service you provide; we received many compliments on the impressive resume.  Thanks so much for all you do. 
 - New Workampers Herb & Kathy
