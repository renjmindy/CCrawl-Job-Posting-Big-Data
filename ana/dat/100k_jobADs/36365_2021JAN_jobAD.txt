  How To Land A Job At Northside Hospital  
 Ariella Coombs 
 September 05, 2017 
 Working in healthcare is rewarding already, but if you can find a position at a place like Northside Hospital, which inspires employees, drives them to be better, and makes them feel at home, you’ve hit the jackpot. Finding a company that works hard to satisfy its employees as well as its customers is a rare, but amazing thing. If you want to land a job at Northside Hospital, make sure you do the following: 
 
 Clearly articulate why you want to work there. 
 According to Talent Acquisition Manager Kelly Piccininni, job seekers should be able to articulate the reasons why they want to work in the healthcare field before applying to Northside Hospital. In order to do this, you’ll need to put your “homework hat” on and do some research. Head over to  Northside Hospital’s Glassdoor page , website, and social media accounts to learn more about it. The more you know about the hospital, the easier it will be to share why you want to work there over anywhere else. This way, when you’re asked “Why Northside?”during the job interview, you’ll have a solid answer. 
 Show your passion for the job. 
 In order to earn a position at Northside Hospital, candidates must have a passion for patient care and service excellence to fit into the culture. “I believe that applicants that don’t grasp the ‘why’ in what we do every day will struggle in any position with our team,” said Piccininni. “The technical skills of any position can be taught with time but one must come with the passion for quality in healthcare.”
