 13 Places to Find Work at home Data Entry Jobs 
 Published by  aw1219  on May 12, 2016 
 We may earn money or products from some of the companies mentioned in this post. 
 Are you a pretty fast typist? Do you have the goal of working from home typing in alpha and numeric keystrokes as your main job duty? If so, there are a few companies that you can go to and find legitimate data entry work at home jobs. Before you apply, make sure that you practice your typing skills and monitor your average typing speed. Most work at home employers that recruits data entry keyers want you not only to type fast but accurately. 
 On average, most people type around 35-40 words per minute or wpm. If you can type 55 words a minute or more, you will find that you will have a greater chance of getting data entry job from home. If your typing speed isn't nearly as high, that doesn't mean that you will not get a data entry work at home job. It simply means that there is room from improvement. Here are some additional tips that will help you improve in your typing skills and speed. 
 
 Type accurately  - Make sure that you focus on typing your words correctly rather than faster in the beginning. If you do so, you will be a more confident typist and increase your speed naturally without having to go back and correct errors. Remember that it is much better to type 40 wpm with 99% accuracy rather than 55 wpm with 50% accuracy. Employers hold accuracy at a much higher level. Speed will come later. 
 Keyboard  - Obtain a keyboard that you feel comfortable using to navigate from letter to letter. Sometimes I have bought some of the lesser expensive keyboards but I have found that the Logitech keyboard (which I currently use) helps me to perform better when I am typing. I purchased it for a couple dollars more than the cheaper keyboard at Walmart but it lasts longer and helps me to type quicker. You can find some Logitech keyboard on their official website or on  Amazon . 
 Sit Upright  - Invest in a chair that will help you to have good posture while you are keying. If you tend to get too relaxed while you are typing by sitting in a chair that is too comfortable or not ergonomic, you will make more mistakes and not be as productive when you work. 
 Clip your Nails  - This tip may sound a little bit funny but it really does work. Every time I clip my nails, I make less clerical errors. Some of the members at Workersonboard Talk mentioned some of the benefits of clipping your nails, that you can read  here . 
 Practice  - If at all possible, try to practice your typing skills every single day. Why? The old saying, "Practice makes perfect" can never be underestimated when it comes to typing. It is a true fact that if you type consistently daily, your typing speed and accuracy will improve.

  15 Legitimate Data Entry Work at Home Jobs  
 Are you a fast typist? Do you like the idea of getting paid to type alpha and numeric keystrokes from home? If so, you may find that a career in data entry will fit your needs perfectly. In fact, before I started working from home, I used to work for the United States Postal Service typing in mailing address and zip codes that were feed to my computer screen that others had written that the scanner was unable to read at the Postal Office. The job was easy and the pay was good but getting it was difficult because you had to pass the Postal Exam. That was a few years ago when working from home was not as much of an option as it is today but now you can do this kind of work online and get paid just the same as you would if you were working outside to home commuting to your job.
