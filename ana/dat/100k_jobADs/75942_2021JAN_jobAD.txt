 Job: Reference Instruction Librarian 
 Posted on  December 11, 2013  by   sarahgprescott 
 12/3/13 -  Reference Instruction Librarian 
Zayed University, Abu Dhabi, UAE 
 Sarah P 's comments : Zayed is arguably one of the better academic institutions in the UAE. That said I have had friends apply there, have interviews that went well, and thenâ€¦nothing. This is business as usual for hiring practices in the Middle East.
