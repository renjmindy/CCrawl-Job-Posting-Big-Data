 Where to Find Us: A Guide to WorkSource Montgomery's Job Centers 
 WorkSource Montgomery (WSM) is proud to make connections between career seekers and local businesses through our locations around the county. 
 WSM is a partner of the American Job Center Network, and our Wheaton center is operated through a coalition of additional partners: Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, Division of Rehabilitative Services, and local non-profits and agencies to provide a comprehensive, quality service to county residents. Through this consortium, job seekers can find unemployment services, language support, disability resources, and intensive job supports. 
 In addition to our Wheaton location, we extend our career services across the county via our Germantown center and our Helping Individuals Reach Employment (H.I.R.E.) satellite location in East County and at County libraries. We also have an alternative for younger job seekers. WSM's Young Adult Opportunity Program team helps residents between the ages of 16-24 years old find their path to independence and self-sufficiency by providing them with tools to develop their educational and employment goals. 
 When career seekers visit any of our centers, experienced career specialists are available to guide them throughout their job search, as well as to help them gain the skills they need to attract employers. All registered customers are welcome to engage in career development  workshops  and participate in hiring  events .
