 These Days Only Losers Have Jobs 
 Posted on  October 15, 2016  by  RonMamita  --  3 Comments 
 Critically think  about that… 
 Two decades ago I would not speak despairingly about employed workers, however, I now look toward a brighter future with creative individuals, communities, or entrepreneurs and otherwise self-reliant individuals. 
 Workers who feel they "Only Work Here  For The Paycheck  " is not only common, but may actually be the majority of all employed personnel. 
Today, slave wages, and the working poor have more in common with a shrinking middle class that are concerned about changes to their  standard of living  … 
 Today, anyone who relies on others for their wealth and/or survival is sitting out on the dangerously precarious limb that could collapse anytime, along with the monetary system. 
Frequent questions are: 
Will their pensions be available when they retire? 
Will the national currency and assets in the banks be worth much or even available in the next crisis? 
 Yes, machines could replace highly paid professionals, such as medical doctors, attorneys, and others in the so-called middle class, and  lower-upper class : 
 Hopefully, everyone know about the rise of corporations and their institutional threat looming over the world. 
What if long ago, civilization was engineered to train newborn babies to be life-long obedient workers striving to " Earn A Living " as a human resource (citizen) for a  sovereign state  (corporation or more specifically "corporate-governance")? 
 Now imagine the future civilization is being re-engineered for a massive reduction in population along with increased automation, artificial intelligence, and robotic workers - the globalists call it “ The Fourth Industrial Revolution “. 
 Institutional governance may not need humans to wage war when they can deploy artificial intelligence, drones with other killing machines and engineered viruses to depopulate the targeted battlefield or region. 
 Know this is not only a American crisis but a worldwide crisis embodied in the United Nations. The centralization of power is promoted by think tanks and publicized for world religion, world sustainability, world trade, world court, and world governance. 
The globalists require the public to leave the thinking to them and remain obedient citizens. 
Meanwhile they engage in  social engineering and design the future civilization . 
It is all so  Orwellian . 
 As too many workers will claim to be  too busy earning a living  to think about this as the elite globalists are strategizing the implementation of worldwide governance. 
Even though workers know something is wrong about the system, they go to work as if that is the only thing they can do and trust others will sort it all out for them. 
 There are old men acting as powerful wizards designing this system. Do they have your permission, do they keep you informed of the contractual details and did they ask you personally for permission? 
 The globalists are happy to think for you! 
They call it "representation" as in representing you and your interests or guarding the public trust. 
They lied. 
They also employ masters of deception. 
The globalists' Public Relations, mass marketing propaganda campaign will disguise the true destructive agenda behind very appealing soundbites for peace, sustainability, Eco-friendly, population management, and world response to crises too big for any single nation to handle alone - yada yada yada… 
 So what can individuals do? 
Each individual can stop supporting the beast. 
Consider survival skills, problem solving, and threat management. 
Think about what could assist the next generation. 
Share your knowledge of the truth and amplify awareness. 
Be creative in discovering ways to enjoy your life experience without institutional governance. 
 Question Authority and THINK for yourself

 You Know Something Is Wrong With The System 
 Does this describe you or anyone you know? 
 * You’re carrying huge amounts of college debt.
* You’re an adult still living with your parents because you can’t afford to move out.
* You’re not able to find a job that pays a livable amount of money.
* You want to get married, but you can’t afford it.
* Prices keep going up, but your income doesn’t follow.
* You’ve got health insurance but can’t afford medical care due to the high deductibles.
* You joined some movement like Operation Wall Street or the Tea Party, or followed a revolutionary politician like Ron Paul or Bernie Sanders, and didn’t see anything change.
* You feel that something’s not right, even though the government and the media keep telling you how great everything is.
 
 State Department welcome student interns to faux transparency in democracy and laughs at the joke, the mockery … 
So much deception and mockery of the citizens’ naivete – disgusting! 
 
 "When I was younger, maybe 10 or 11, I remember playing a game of Monopoly with a friend. I was doing well, but I was still losing – and that’s when I realized that my friend, who was acting as the bank, was cheating by secretly moving money from the bank over to his own pile. Once I figured this out, I quit the game. Why play a game when it’s impossible to win? 
 In a nutshell, that’s what’s happening to you in today’s America. Throughout your entire childhood, you were told about the American Dream, and how if you worked hard and did the right things, you could build a good life for yourself. If you’re reading this, then you’ve figured out that something went wrong: Either someone’s cheating, or they changed the rules without telling you. 
 I’m here to tell you that this is exactly what happened. 
 The generations before you actually did have a real shot at achieving their dreams, but over time, so many people cheated, looking for shortcuts to achieving their own dreams, that they ended up changing the game. They rigged the game, and now that it’s your turn to play, they’ve made it almost impossible for you to win. 
 … 
 In reality, I’m a typical middle-aged guy. I’ve achieved my own American Dream, with a wife, two kids, two dogs and a house with a white picket fence in the suburbs (seriously). 
 I’ve pretty much got it made – but over time, as I learned about how the game is rigged, how the odds are stacked against the next generation, I’ve come to realize that my kids are going to face huge hurdles in achieving their dreams – hurdles I didn’t have to face. And it’s not just my kids: I realized that a lot of people in my generation, and the majority of people younger than me, are in the same boat. 
 Not only are most of them destined for a life of frustration and unfilled dreams, but the system that’s holding them down is the same system that’s choking the life out of this country. And it’s all because some of the people who came before us decided to rewrite the rules of the game, benefiting them and hurting the rest of us."

 The Matrix Has You! 
 
 Morpheus said: "That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. 
A prison for your mind." - The Matrix (1999 Movie) 
 
 Stop Playing Their Game! 
 Unplug.
