 2D Artist 
 Ganymede Games Apply for this Job 
 Posted 
 December 8, 2020 
 Contract 
 Anywhere 
 Remote 
 We’re  Ganymede Games , an independent game studio in Las Cruces, NM, and we’re looking for a 2D artist to join our team. We're a unique mix of industry veterans and people new to the video game industry. We're fun, serious about success and driven to create awesome experiences for players. 
 As the first artist joining, you’ll create and implement creatures, characters, and environments for an unannounced sci-fi RPG for PC/Console platforms. We’ve been prototyping the game for several months now, so you’ll be joining a project that has a strong, clear vision. 
 ‍ 
 This position is full-time and you can work remote. It will remain remote for the foreseeable future (not planning to change post-pandemic). 
 As we’re currently just a small team of three people shipping our first game as a studio, we’re only considering candidates based in North America time zones. We also want to be upfront that because you're the first artist, and we really want to ensure you're fitting in well, this role will start as a contract position for the first 90 days and then convert to full-time if we both think it's an awesome fit. 
 If you’re curious to learn more about the game we’re building, this  player survey  should give you a good idea of the direction we’re headed. We will share more about info about the game to candidates who we move forward with.  ‍ 
 ‍ 
 What’s the mission? 
 
 Establish and maintain the overall art style and visual direction for the game 
 Create production-quality 2D art assets, including but not limited to characters, creatures, environments, and UI elements 
 Integrate the art assets into game with P4 and Unity  ‍ 
 
 ‍ 
 Must haves: 
 
 Strong conceptual design and composition skills, and a great sense of colour, lighting, perspective, and anatomy 
 Highly entrepreneurial mindset ready to wear a lot of different hats as needed 
 Experience with modern game engines (our game is in Unity, but UE4 experience is great, too) 
 Art portfolio that demonstrates both your creativity and craft as an artist 
 Proficient with Adobe Creative Suite software 
 You love RPGs  ‍ 
 
 ‍ 
 Nice to haves: 
 
 Character animation experience in Spine or equivalent 
 Shipped one video game from concept to completion 
 A love of the sci-fi genre  ‍ 
 
 ‍ 
 To apply: 
 
 Send your resume, cover letter, and portfolio (online only) to  explore@ganymede.games 
 We’ll take notice of a well-written cover letter that shows you did your homework on Ganymede and explains why you’re interested in joining our team. We’d love to hear about your favorite games, sci-fi movies/documentaries, and personal hobbies, so tell us about what gets you most passionate! 
 If we’re interested in moving forward with your application, we will contact you in January to continue the process, which will include an art test
