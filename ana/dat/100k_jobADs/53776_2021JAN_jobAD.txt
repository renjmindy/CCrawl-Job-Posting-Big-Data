 About BuildZoom 
 We're leveraging data, ML, and web-based workflow tools to dramatically improve the construction and remodeling experience for homeowners, architects, and contractors. 
 About the role 
 Skills:  React, Ruby on Rails 
 BuildZoom is a managed marketplace that is modernizing the $1.2 trillion remodeling and construction industry. We guide clients with medium-to-large residential and light commercial projects through the construction process and help them turn vision into physical reality. Our platform ensures accountability and transparency throughout the process, enabling us to deliver great outcomes in a historically challenging industry. Last year, we managed over $150M in construction projects and are on track to double this year. 
 We're looking for an experienced software engineer that is ready for a bigger role. Join BuildZoom to be a hands-on contributor that leads by example, establishes the architectural vision, and inspires his colleagues to strive for self-improvement. Work closely with our founders and CTO to drive strategy and execution of key initiatives. 
 We’re a data company at heart, ingesting vast volumes of construction and real estate data to gain deep insight into the construction marketplace. Our bleeding-edge data ingestion framework has helped us accumulate the most complete and timely data sets in the industry. On top of that wealth of data, we've built analytics capabilities and a recommendations engine that (we hope) will redefine the industry. Data and analytics alone won't cut it though; we need help building sophisticated UX that harnesses the power of our unique assets via data visualizations and workflow tools. Come help us!

 6+ years of hands-on software engineering experience in a professional team-based environment.
