 Amazon is offering its employees up to $5,000 to quit their jobs 
 by  Jan Moore  | Apr 16, 2014 |  Blog 
 The “Pay to Quit” program is an effort to make sure employees really want to be there. The program encourages employees to think about what they really want. 
 Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezon says, “In the long-run, an employee staying somewhere they don’t want to be isn’t healthy for the employee or the company.” 
 So, I wonder… 
 What would happen if your company made the same offer? 
 How much would you need to be offered to quit?
