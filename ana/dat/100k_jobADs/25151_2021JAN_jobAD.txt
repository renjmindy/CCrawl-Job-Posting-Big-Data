 Regulatory Affairs Manager - 12 month contract - Oxford 
 My client, a growing Pharmaceutical company based in Oxford, is currently recruiting for a Regulatory Manager to join their team on an initial 12 month contract basis. 
 This role has become available due to a period of growth within the company and there is a strong chance that this contract will extend beyond the initial period. 
 The ideal candidate will have a full lifecycle background (global); development (CTA, IMPDs, Clinical Regulatory Updates etc.) through to Registrations (MAA), Post Approval (Variations and Renewals), CMC (write and review) and labelling (SmPCs and PILs). 
 For further details about this role or other opportunities within Regulatory Affairs please contact Tim Barratt on +44 (0) 1727 817 626 or email a copy of your CV to tbarratt@keypeople.co.uk
