 My client, a global, award winning SaaS business urgently requires a temporary credit controller. Reporting to the Finance Director and working as part of a team of 4 this role is pivotal in ensuring the organisation meets its cash collection goals. 
 You will be working from home in the instance and will have access to the company's systems and VOIP capability. The role involves collecting cash from UK and US clients, typically high volume, medium to low value. The majority of time will be spent on the phone with a call target of 200 plus per week. Initially we are looking for someone for 3 months, however there is the chance that the role will last longer or become a permanent opportunity. 
 The successful candidate will have a solid credit control background, have strong verbal communication skills and be able to build client rapport quickly. Ideally you will have used Sage 50 and have some experience of working for a SaaS business or similar. 
 This is a great opportunity to work for a Finance Director who is passionate about collections and work for a company whose product is in demand. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
