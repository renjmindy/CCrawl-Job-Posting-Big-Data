 A Job Done Well. 
 A Job Done Well. 
 Today's chance meeting with a former student gave me a proud moment or three. 
 February 6, 2019February 6, 2019   wordynerdbird 
 This morning I took my father to town for a medical appointment. It all went well, and quite quickly, so he decided he’d like to shop for a couple of things he needed. 
 As part of that shopping expedition, I took him to one locally owned store where the service has always been excellent. 
 It was a lovely surprise to see one of my former students who now works there. 
 “How are things with you?” I asked her. 
 “Really good!” she answered happily. “I really enjoy working here, and the boss is great to work for.” 
 When I introduced her to my father, she responded with respect and chatted with him about what he was looking for. 
 With utmost professionalism and kindness, she helped him find exactly what he wanted and made him feel as though he was her most important customer all day.  What a blessing to be able to have such a positive impact on an elderly man's shopping trip, which for him have become quite rare. 
 In doing so, she both impressed me and made me incredibly proud. 
 Her boss also happens to be the dad of some of my former students. When I asked after them, he told me they were happy and well, and enjoying what they were doing. 
 As a teacher, it’s harder than my students know to wave them goodbye and set them free to fly at the end of each year, but it is wonderful to know that they are happy in their chosen path and making their own way forward in the big, wide world. 
 Whether they choose university, a trade, hospitality, retail, or other pursuits doesn’t matter to me, as long as it’s what they want to do. 
 I have no intention of trying to take all the credit for any of my former students’ successes - far from it. I know I am only one of many who have helped and taught them, and encouraged them to pursue their goals and dreams. Even so, today I can enjoy the satisfaction of knowing that, for at least those three, it has been a job done well.
