 JOB BANKS FOR YOUR JOB SEARCH 
 Imagine a company posts a job on one of the many popular online job banks. It looks like a great job and you apply. The problem is, thousands of other pairs of eyes have also seen that job and applied. Your chances are shrinking. Then a computer might review your resume, not a human being; so if you don’t have the right key words, your chances are now even smaller. Let’s face it; job banks are easy to use but difficult to find success. So, does that mean don’t use them? No. It means don’t use them as your only job search strategy. Incorporate job banks into a highly diverse, strategic job search plan.
