 10 Things to Question about Your Life after Undergrad 
 Questionable phases of life after gradation. We all go through them and we all survive them….well most of us do. Here are 10 things to question: 
 1. Receiving a job offer 
 
 Because of all the talk about the difficulty of getting a job, if you do receive an offer, it becomes very suspicious.  Wait, I only applied to 20 jobs and actually got one?  Whereas, you hear horror stories of people applying to 40 jobs and getting one interview and no job.  It is a paid position, right? Not an internship?  Always be on high alert when something happens too easily in the working-world. Unless you got hired at McDonald's, then just nod and accept it. 
 2. Old friends 
 
 Some of your old friends act like they have too much of their shiznit together. Those are the ones you need to watch out for. No one has that much of their life pieced together yet. And with the politics starting to erupt already for 2016, some of your friends' true colors are coming out over Facebook…question their reasoning. Block. 
 3. Your relationship status 
 
 If you feel like Christ Traeger, you are probably questioning yourself, too. Leaving undergrad means leaving all of your friends, and who knows when you will all be together in one spot again? 
 4. All the work you did in undergrad 
 
 All that stuff you had to memorize for exams was beyond pointless. It was actually wasteful. Wasted the space in your brain, wasted your time, wasted thousands of note cards. Question why you tried so hard do to do well in those useless courses. And then be ready to get mad. 
 5. Your ability to keep it all together 
 
 If you can fake it enough to act like you have it all together, you deserve an award. If you think you have your life all put together nicely, you need to question yourself. Don't lie to us, you rub your face into a pillow every night before bed like our trusty, relate-able buddy, Nick Miller. 
 6. Your career choice 
 
 Think you know what you want to do after you graduate? Guess again. Chances are you will question yourself with every job application or every grad school assignment. If all else fails, become a wizard; it's as close as you will be to a real job after you graduate anyway. 
 7. Your ability to stay professional at all times 
 
 Think you will act like a mature adult now that you have a diploma? Chances are you will become very sarcastic very quickly. Professionalism is boring anyway, so question those who act like it all the time. Plus, you're still a child in the eyes of many. 
 8. Your so-called undergrad accomplishments 
 
 Think being secretary in an undergrad club will get you far in the job market? Think that one intramural team you were on will help? It won't. And the lack of actual "accomplishments" on your resume will only make you feel worse. I hate that part of a resume anyway. Can watching Netflix be on there? 
 9. Your interview capabilities 
 
 Maybe give yourself a practice round or two before that job interview. And if you don't, question why you aren't. No one is actually prepared for an interview. That's the joke of the year. It's also something they didn't teach you in undergrad, so question your college/university on that one. 
 10. Your ability to flirt 
 
 If you think you're still in 'the game', you're probably wrong. Question why it hasn't worked out for you so far.
