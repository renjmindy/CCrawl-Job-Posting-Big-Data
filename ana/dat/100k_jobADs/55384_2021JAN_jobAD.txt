 New Career In Politics For Moyes 
 April 22, 2014   greenteeth   Uncategorized football ,  Manchester United ,  satire ,  ukip 
 News bulletin's are full today of the sacking of manager David Moyes by Manchester United. It has been coming a long time, Boggart Blog asked during the first half of a match last November in which United had conceded early goals: Will Dave Moyes last as Man U manager until: 
 a) The end of the year 
b) The end of the season 
c) The end of the current game 
 Wrong on all counts it turns out, he saw out the game and the calendar year but did not make the end of the football season. 
 By United's standards it has been a disastrous season, seventh in the Premier League with little chance of improving on that over the last few games and thus not even a place in the Europa League in prospect next season, not a trophy in sight and the certainty of finishing below arch rivals Manchester City and outside the top four for the first time since the Premier League was founded. 
 Still everything has a smile hidden in it (OK, not for United fans maybe,) and this tweet, allegedly from Nigel Farage is worth repeating; 
 **David Moyes has taken Manchester United out of Europe. He is welcome to join UKIP
