 Job losses and some positive announcements 
 Leave a Comment  /  Uncategorized  / By    Katleen  
 Dear Readers, 
 I suppose this week/last week has been a mixed bag of job losses  Talk Talk Call Centre to close in Wexford - with the loss of 550 jobs  -and  400 workers face dole as troubled firms wield axe . 
 I know that's all bad news and my heart goes out to those on the receiving end, but there are also some positive announcement, as the expansion of  VM Ware in Cork who are announcing 250 new jobs . 
 I just noticed  a  new section  on the   Enterprise Ireland website  so you can see all the companies in their portfolio and if you click on the relevant logo of a company it will bring you to their currrent vacancies. Some of them go straight to the client's website, others go to  www.jobs.ie 
 If you missed  www.careerzoo.ie , check out the   list of exhibitors  . 
 I also wanted to remind you of the  Jobbridge initiative  . 
 What is it again? 
 JobBridge is a new National Internship Scheme that will provide work experience placements for interns for a 6 or 9 month period. 
 The aim of the National Internship Scheme is to assist in breaking the cycle where jobseekers are unable to get a job without experience, either as new entrants to the labour market after education or training or as unemployed workers wishing to learn new skills. The scheme will also give people a real opportunity to gain valuable experience to bridge the gap between study and the beginning of their working lives. 
 The scheme will provide for up to 5,000 work experience placements in the private, public and voluntary sectors. This will be a time-limited scheme. Interns will receive an allowance of â‚¬50 per week on top of their existing social welfare entitlement. This will be payable for the period of the internship. 
 Happy jobhunting!
