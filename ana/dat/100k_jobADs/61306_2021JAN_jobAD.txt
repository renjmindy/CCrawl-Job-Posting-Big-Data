 About us 
 Hexocene is a digital innovation and cyber security consultancy. We are re-launching the brand, along with new products, in the new year. 
 The role 
 We are looking for someone to help us create a number of short educational video/animation content.  The requirement is for you to: 
 
 Conceptualise the style of the videos we create 
 Create videos that work with the scripts we provide 
 Create videos that are creative, impactful, refreshing, simple and professional 
 Contribute to the creation of a supportive and enjoyable working environment that delivers. This will involve embracing a culture of positive feedback and challenge 
 
 The role is currently a temporary freelance contract, and part time. 
 It starts immediately. 
 The successful candidate will be an important member of the team, reporting directly to the MD. 
 Your skills and experience 
 We ask two things of you: the ability to deliver these objectives to an exceptional standard, and the embracing of our values. We won't stipulate how your CV should look beyond that. 
 Integrity, diversity and sustainabilty are important to us. Regardless of position, role and experience, we expect everyone to support each other and help each other grow and develop. 
 When it comes to clients, we want to provide them with the best possible service and solution that we can. The same goes for our wider business setup. We've therefore banned phrases such as "why don't we just...?" and replaced them with "what's the best possible way we can...given the resources we have..?". 
 You will need to be great at: 
 
 being creative 
 delivering 
 making impactful videos that explain the learning in a way 
 working in a team 
 meeting deadlines 
 working remotely 
 using your experience and initiative to self start and deliver 
 content creation 
 communicating 
 planning and delivery 
 
 Please include your rate and an intro in your applications
