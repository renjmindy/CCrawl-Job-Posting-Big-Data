 a bit of writerly advice 
 
 This is my advice: 
 Think of yourself as a worker. 
 Show up at the job. 
 
 -novelist, memoirist, essayist, and craft book writer  Sandra Scofield 
 Still working through Scofield's  The Scene Book  to help me revise my WIP, a  behemoth  historical novel manuscript. 
 And work is just what it is. Okay, some days are better than others-the synapses firing at a clip. Sometimes it feels like crafting; once in a while it even feels like making art. 
 For me, mindset matters. Work demands discipline; I'm responsible to it. No one calls in late for work with excuses like,  the muse didn 't speak to me  or  the mood wasn 't right . 
 Later today, much of the U.S. will watch two teams of men go to work. We call it play, but my guess is they don't. 
 Tomorrow, muse or not, mood or not, it's back to workâ€¦
