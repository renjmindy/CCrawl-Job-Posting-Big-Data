 Okay 
 Hot Damn! it's a Freelance job 
 fivestone is looking for a Freelance Website Designer in Brooklyn, NY, USA. Not an ordinary Freelance Website Designer but the kind of Freelance Website Designer that makes other Freelance Website Designers question their Freelance Website Designer-ness. 
 About 
 Yes indeed! It's the classic creative agency story. We're too busy with client work to create our own website and we're looking for designers to help re-design our agency website. We have all of the content and we're looking for a savvy digital designer that knows how to create a compelling visual experience for the website framework and also knows how to create killer visuals and comps for showcasing our case studies and portfolio. If you're available and interested let us know. Looking to get this going ASAP!
