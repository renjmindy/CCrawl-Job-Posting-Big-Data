With so many opportunities under one roof, you'll be sure to find a career path that inspires you. 
 ABOUT OUR TEAMS:

 Cleaning the store floors by sweeping, mopping, running the auto scrubber, and vacuuming. 
Gather and empty all trash, dispose in the designated canister outside of receiving 
Requisition supplies and equipment needed to management for cleaning and maintenance duties

 Gain experience in a different business unit—from the store to the salon or the Pets Hotel 
Develop your leadership skills as a Department or Assistant Manager role 
Tackle the challenge of a new store opening 
Transfer to any one of our 1600 stores nationwide 
 THE WARM AND FUZZIES: 
We’ve highlighted job responsibilities as best as we could above—but the best parts of working at PetSmart can’t be fully described in the job description. 
 It’s the excitement you feel when you help a little one pick out his very first fish. And not just any goldfish, but that one, right there, no not that one, this one, yea! 
It’s the relief Rosie feels when you help her mom select the best food for her upset tummy and her delight when it turns out to be chicken flavored!! 
It’s the pride of the giving Mickey a makeover in our salons watching him strut his stuff on the way out. Paws off, ladies, he’s taken! 
It’s the joy of reuniting Frankie with her family after a fun stay in our Pets Hotel. 
It’s the celebration of Bella’s birthday, Gizmo’s graduation from puppy classes or Ace’s adoption. 
It’s the little things we do that add up to really big things that pets need. 
 Working at PetSmart is not a job, it’s a community of those who work together for the love of pets.
