 Please don't find another person from ANU again. That would make it 4 from the last 4, and just reinforce my view about Australian universities.

 Why do plumbers with less than 3yrs experience make more then associate professors in Econ? Why do Oz universities pay so little? 117K in Canberra is not really that much money. I'd expect that someone on that level would be on at least 150-200K. At that level you would expect people to be very good and very experienced, why would they bother? Especially in fields such as economics, where their skill would easily be transferable to private/government sector. Obviously you guys are not doing it for the money. How do Oz universities compare in terms of pay with US, Europe, Japan, Singapore etc? I guess we are treating academics the same way we treat our teachers, we all very much appreciate and like the very useful role they play in our society but we' are unwilling to pay for it. Or is it the case that we have more supply then demand? Andrew your thoughts?

 We had the trade wages  discussion  on this blog in 2006. Turns out their wages aren't as high as some think. 
 hrvoje  , the top 1% cutoff is about $180,000 (if this surprises you, then you just learned something about how unrepresentative your friends are of the rest of Australia). It seems reasonableÃ‚ that university academics in the second-top tier are notÃ‚ among the richest 1%.

 I can answer some of the rest of the question: 
 HK and Singapore wages are much higher (especially when including tax) 
US wages are higher at the top end, and lower at the bottom end. 
French and Italian wages are lower. UK wages are similar. There is far too much supply in some areas where there are no competing industries, since everyone gets money for creating PhD students. When there is competition (e.g., engineering) there is not enough supply. The only reason many departments in many univerisities in these areas still function is thanks to Iran and China exporting smart people that evidentally find it hard to get good jobs in industry (presumably due to poor spoken English, for example). Similarly, most PhD students in some areas don't come from Australia. If they start going home, there will be big big problems. 
 The job advertized here is exceptional in that almost everywhere excluding ANU, the work conditions are worse in Australia than other decent countries (since pay rises were traded off with conditions over a long period of time). 
 THere are further differences in how easy it is to get promoted. Its much harder in Australia than, say, the UK, because many universities are scraping the bottom of the barrel, so they don't have the money to promote people (this happened in HK to). So if you are young and ambitious, you are almost certainly better off overseas moneywise. Similarly, Australia basically promotes on the amount of money you collect from outside sources, wheras some countries promote based on good quality research. So if you are good at making money, Australia is good. If you good at science but not the former, Australia is bad. 
 In my impression, Australian universities and associated organizes (ARC, NHMRC etc.) are exceptionally nepositic (probably similar to France and Italy). Universities commonly hire their own students/colleagues (like France) for no reason apart from the fact they are, and how many friends you get that review your grants seems well correlated with whether you get it. Singapore, HK, and the UK are better in this respect (although I hear complaints about the UK grant system).
