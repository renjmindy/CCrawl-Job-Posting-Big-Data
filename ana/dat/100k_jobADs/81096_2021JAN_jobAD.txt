 Careers 
 MSR-FSR strives to be the best at providing managed engineering services to the high technology sector. 
 In today's economic climate, our customers face challenges such as the divergence in the cost of technology advancement and the unit cost of consumer goods, the cost of waste, and the threats posed by competitors. 
 From these challenges must come innovative solutions. 
 Our organization has a dedicated global network of staff, but we're always looking for determined, innovative people who enjoy teamwork, who thrive in a competitive environment and who want to deliver the right results for our clients. 
 If you are looking for a professional and rewarding career with a global, world-class organization, please visit our  career page with current openings  or email your CV or resume to  careers@msr-fsr.com
