 Podcast 
 The Network invites scientists to have a discussion about their research, a list of questions that will be provided before and then it’s just a case of chatting with one of the iLEAPS committee team about the work you are doing to create the podcast. It is a relaxed discussion and will be pre-recorded so you have the opportunity to listen to the podcast too. The podcast will be shared on the iLEAPS website for the wider community to listen too. The discussion can be set up at a date convenient to you during October and November. 
 Poster conference 
 This will be hosted on twitter. Early career scientists are invited to upload their poster onto twitter on the 26th November.
