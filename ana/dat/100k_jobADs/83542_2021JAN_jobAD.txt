 Job Demands Analysis 
 Do you need to know the specific job demands for a particular job? 
 Answer: Yes! 
 If you plan to hire employees, accommodate those with work restrictions or comply with the ADA then having an accurate picture of the job demands is essential. 
 A job demands analysis (JDA) will help you: 
 
 Develop a legally defensible pre-work testing program 
 Make decisions about employees returning to work with medical restrictions 
 Answer accommodation requests from employees with a disability 
 Create more effective rehabilitation programs if an employee is injured on the job

 Job descriptions can be outdated by the time they are printed and filed. 
 We can help you quantify the physical demands for any job. 
 
 Document the work in real time by measuring forces required such as lifting, carrying, pushing and pulling. 
 Record the postures employees must use to complete work tasks, such as reaching, stooping, kneeling or squatting. 
 Monitor climbing, balancing, walking or crawling. 
 Create a written document that outlines all this information in a concise, easy to read format. 
 
 All of this information helps you make decisions about hiring new employees, granting accommodation requests or transitioning an injured employee back to work. 
 You can rest assured that your job descriptions accurately depict what the job requires and your program is legally defensible.
