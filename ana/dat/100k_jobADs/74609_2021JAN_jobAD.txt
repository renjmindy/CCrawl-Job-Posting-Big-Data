  5 Major Social Networking Job Search Mistakes to Avoid in 2012  
 Jessica Holbrook Hernandez 
 December 14, 2011 
 If you’re engaged in a  job search  right now, take some time during the holiday season to revamp your job search strategy and make sure you aren’t committing any of these job search stalling mistakes. 
 SOCIAL NETWORKING MISTAKES 
 LinkedIn Mistake #1:  Never request to be endorsed by someone you have never professionally or personally worked with, for, or with whom you have conducted business. It is incredibly unprofessional. How can someone recommend you and the work you’ve done if they’ve never actually worked with you in some way, shape, or form?  LinkedIn Mistake #2:  Posting an unprofessional photo of yourself. LinkedIn is a professional networking site, so it should be kept professional. Post a headshot of yourself in a business or business casual outfit. Don’t upload an image of yourself partying, drinking, or with other people. Employers will look you up—and you do not want to do anything to eliminate yourself from a potential opportunity.  LinkedIn Mistake #3:  Not utilizing job search groups. There are more groups on LinkedIn than you could possibly imagine, and there’s at least one for just about every career field you can think of—so get connected! Look up your career field in the search bar and see what kind of groups you can find, and join the ones you like. I also recommend joining job search groups; it’s another great way to get leads about jobs you never would have heard of otherwise.  Twitter Mistake #1:  Not including a bio that speaks to the type of career you’re pursuing. Twitter is a great way to find job leads, and if you’re not using it you should be! Follow others who can help you in your job search.  Twitter Mistake #2:  Not using hashtags. Hashtags can surprisingly create job search leads for you that you would not have had otherwise. Use them! As you continue in your job search throughout the holiday season, take a few moments to rethink your  social networking job search strategy . Maybe you’re not using social media at all—or maybe you’re a social media pro. In any case, make sure you’re not committing any of the mistakes listed here. And above all else… stay positive!
