 For this month's next review for Genre Grandeur - Boston Films, here's a review of The Brink's Job (1978) by  Ryan of Ten Stars or Less 
 Thanks again to  Ryan of Ten Stars or Less  for choosing this month's genre. 
 Next month's Genre has been chosen by  Vern of the Video Vortex . We will be reviewing our favorite  Graphic Novels that have been adapted for the screen. 
 The one caveat is that it has to be based on a book that has been published. 
 Example The Killing Joke would be acceptable because it's based on an actual graphic novel. The Dark Knight would not because it's based on characters and there was no book before the movie. 
 Here is what appears to be the official/unofficial list of film adaptations of Graphic Novels

 Please get me your submissions by the 25th of May by sending them to Vernsworld@movierob.net 
 Try to think out of the box! Great choice Vern! 
 Let's see what Ryan thought of this movie:

The Brink's Job Review 
 5/10 
 Sometimes the perfect crime gets unraveled by the criminals who are smart one minute and stupid the next. This all-star cast bring to life one of the century's greatest crimes, the robbing of the Brinks Building in 1950 Boston. Of course any heist of this magnitude requires a close-knit group of guys, but egos always get in the way and cause everything to fall apart. This film focuses on the slow build up of the crime, followed by the swift action of the government in the aftermath. I'd say this particular film should not be considered among the best heist theme movies ever, but it isn't the worse either.
