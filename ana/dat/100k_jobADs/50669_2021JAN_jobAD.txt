 TSM is now providing The Third-Party Jobsite Safety Accountability Supervisor (JSAS) requirements that have been put in place for both large and small construction projects in  Alameda ,  Contra Costa ,  Marin ,  San Francisco ,  San Mateo ,  Santa Clara  Counties and the  City of Berkeley . All TSM Third-Party Jobsite Safety Accountability Supervisors (JSAS) have completed first aid training in the last two years and obtained OSHA-30 certificates as per the requirements of the county mandates. 
 What is the role of the JSAS?: The JSAS will work with the prime contractor and the Public Health Department to provide third-party project compliance verification through documentation of visual inspections and interviews with workers during their site visits. The JSAS will work with the prime contractor's safety officer to resolve any deficiencies to help keep the site in compliance. 
 Interested in our Third-Party JSAS services? Send us an email here  or give our Senior Estimator Dave Clayson a call at 916-826-0154.
