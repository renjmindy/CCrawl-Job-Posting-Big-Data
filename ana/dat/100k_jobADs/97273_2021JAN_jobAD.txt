 Role overview 
 About this Role 
 You will lead integrations with upcoming blockchains into the Chainlink platform, working directly, and building relationships with the founding engineers while learning about each new innovative blockchain platform. Today, most blockchains are their own ecosystems, but this is about to change: cross-blockchain connectivity is set to be the next growth opportunity, with network effects compounding when leveraging the strengths of each blockchain. You will be the driving force for owning this initiative and will make a large impact on the growth of a critical piece of blockchain infrastructure. We are a fully distributed team and have the tools and benefits to support you in your remote work environment.

 Interface with leadership, customers, users, and the community to implement seamless integrations to allow for the exponential growth of the network 
 Lead cutting edge blockchain platform integrations 
 Manage the technical aspects of integrating Chainlink with blockchains 
 Build token bridges between blockchains utilizing the Chainlink network 
 Work closely with node operators to connect their Chainlink nodes to other blockchains 
 Develop best practices and documentation to scale integrations 
 
 Our Stack:  Golang, Rust, TypeScript, Solidity, Postgres, Terraform, AWS 
 Job requirements 
 
 2+ years of professional experience working in a product-driven environment 
 Experience in Golang or Rust; otherwise experience in JS, Ruby, Python, C++, C, or Solidity and a willingness to learn 
 Resourceful developer and fast learner continually striving to discover more environments 
 Ability to write and communicate effectively 
 Eagerness to work openly and collaboratively with a diverse team 
 Experience in blockchain and other Web 3.0 technologies 
 Comfort and/or experience working as a remote employee as a part of a distributed team 
 
 POI:  This role is location agnostic anywhere in the world, though we ask that you overlap some working hours with Eastern Standard Time (EST) in the US.
