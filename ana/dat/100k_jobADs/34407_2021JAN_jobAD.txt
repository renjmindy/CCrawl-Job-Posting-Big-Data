 My client, a multinational high tech manufacturer urgently requires an interim finance professional to assist in the integration of a recent acquisition. Despite the effects of Covid 19 this business has maintained volumes and has a strong pipeline for 2021 and beyond. 
 The role will work with an internal line manager who will act as a facilitator to integrate new co into the parent company's controls framework and GL systems. There is an internal master plan and stage 1 delivery integration is planned for Spring 2021. 
 The successful candidate must have hands on acquisition integration experience, specifically with process flow mapping. Also useful will be experience of working in a complex, matrix business. Finally, business partnering skills are essential, specifically the ability to build rapport remotely and to influence and persuade stakeholders. 
 This is a great opportunity to own this integration project and work cross functionally. They may be the option for the project to extend beyond Spring 2021. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
