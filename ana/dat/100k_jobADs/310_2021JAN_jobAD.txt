 Job brief 
 We are looking for a Nanny to join our team and provide excellent childcare to our clients’ families. 
 What do Nannies do? 
 As a Nanny, you’ll take care of children, keep them safe and clean, plan meals for them and organize creative and educational activities based on their age. Occasionally, you’ll need to pick them up from school or other extracurricular activities. 
 If you love working – and playing – with children and, also feel comfortable handling the less appealing tasks, such as changing diapers and tidying up children’s rooms, we’d like to meet you. 
 Ultimately, you’ll reassure parents that, even when they’re not around, their children remain in a safe and pleasant environment.

 Teach children appropriate social behaviors, such as being respectful to each other and helping out with chores 
 Transport children to and from school and extracurricular activities 
 Tidy up play areas and children’s rooms 
 Assist young students with homework 
 Ensure children’s safety during indoors and outdoors activities 
 Take care of children in case of injury or illness 
 Perform housekeeping tasks as needed 
 Work with parents to ensure children’s growth and social development 
 
 Requirements 
 
 Previous experience as a Nanny or Babysitter 
 Excellent understanding of child development in different age stages 
 Ability to come up with creative ideas to educate and engage children 
 Multitasking skills 
 A pleasant and patient personality 
 Availability to work in shifts, during weekends, in the evenings and occasionally full days 
 A clean driving license 
 High school diploma; further training in child development is a plus 
 First aid certification is a plus
