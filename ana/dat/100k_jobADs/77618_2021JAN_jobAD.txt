 For those who do not know who I am my name is Wilhelmina Lundy and I am a servant of the most high Sovereign God Jesus Christ. Let's get in to the word. 
 Job chapter 29 
 Verse 1-6 
 Job says how I long for the months gone by, for the days when God watched over me, when he shined his light on my path. Job says oh for the days when I was in my prime. When God was with me and my children were around me. 
 _When we are going through a hard time, we do long for the time when life was great and it all seems so far away. Job is reminiscing on the days when God showed him favor.  _ 
 Verse 7-17 
 In these verses Job speaks on when he would go to the gate, how young men and old men alike would show him honor and respect. He says when the unfortunate was happy to see him. When he would put on righteousness as his clothing; Job says justice was my robe and my turban. He says I was the eyes to the blind and feet to the lame. He says I was a father to the needy. Job says I broke the fangs of the wicked and snatched the victims from their teeth. 
 _Reading this I thought about my own christian walk, I asked myself am I putting on righteousness as my clothing and if not how can I. These verses helps us understand the upright and blameless part about Job. He was willing to go head to head with the wicked for the sake of saving a soul. Hallelujah  _ 
 Verse 18-25 
 Job says I thought I would die in my house as an old man. He says men listened to him expectantly waiting for the good news, and after he spoke they had nothing else to say.  Job says he sat as their chief. 
 _Job takes a walk down memory lane and remembers when he was a respected man. Even though Job was thinking about the good ole days he forgot to leave them behind, the only need to mention of them was for Job to prove a point about his everyday walk. What I did notice which was a valuable lesson for me, is all the great things Job said he did at the gate none of his friends noticed it. They actually felt he sinned against the people that he was actually helping.  _ 
 So you can be doing great things just don 't expect others to notice. Only expect God to take note for he sees all on things on this earth

 Hey wilhemina it's better for us to store up treasures in heaven rather than get appreciation from humans

Like james says faith without works is dead
