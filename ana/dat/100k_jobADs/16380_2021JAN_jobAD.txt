  Top Talent Doesn’t Job Search Online  
 J.T. O'Donnell 
 June 19, 2012 
 I had the opportunity to write an article for  Fast Company  magazine on the subject of  Employment Branding . It’s called “ How to Make Your Company a Talent Magnet, Even in Tough Times .” 
 
 Top Talent Doesn’t Job Search Online 
 In the article, I make a case the best-of-the-best aren’t obsessing over their LinkedIn profiles. Instead, they are busy doing work they like at jobs they love. So, getting them to ditch their current gigs for one with your company is going to take some strategic marketing. My solution: blogging. I encourage you to ponder the story I tell in the article from two standpoints: How can employers do a better job telling their employment stories? How can job seekers get better at using blogs to find ideal job opportunities? Everyone knows the number one way to land a job/fill a position is networking. And, in today’s wonderful online world, we have one of the most amazing tools for making networking happen virtually. I’m not talking about social media - I’m talking about blogging. It’s the storytelling that facilitates the matching process. If you’re a recruiter, how do you use blogging to find top talent? If you're a job seeker, how are you using blogging to connect with top employers? 
 Can't find the right talent? We can help! 
 Tired of waiting around for the perfect job candidate? Let us do the work for you! Learn how our Employment Branding services can help your company connect with the best job candidates and acquire top talent.
