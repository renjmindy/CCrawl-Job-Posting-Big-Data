 Looking for an Editor of Journal articles for academia, Native Engl... 
 Published: Yesterday  Bids: 1 
 Hi dear freelancers, 
 I thank you all beforehand for applying. 
I am the head of an editing and proofreading team, and I need some professional editors for proofreading and editing academic journal articles that are going to be sent to the best journals. The topics of these articles might differ from medicine, physics, engineering, philosophy, etc. So the freelancer needs to have experience with different texts. 
I need you to check the texts for punctuation, spelling, grammar, readability, vocabulary, etc. I also need the text to be checked by Grammarly Premium at the end of your editing, preferably. 
I know all of you applicants are great at your job, but just to make sure I can find the best editors I want for the team, I'm going to ask you to do a very small sample test for me and send it to me by your proposals. 
I am going to be available and I will answer each and every one of your proposals so you make sure you have a chance of getting seen. 
 This is going to be an on-going project, so keep that in mind. I considered $0.09 per word for this level of expert editing. Please send me your suggestions for the pay and I will definitely consider it. 
 Please edit this short paragraph in the attached file as a test using the Track Changes tool in Mircrosoft Word. 
Thank you all in advance.

 Create a video for presentation 
 Published: 1 week ago  Bids: 1 
 There has been quite a push to get rid of cash these past few years driven by governments, retailers, banks and other societal pressures. Cash provides something digital payments do not normally provide, the ability to make offline & anonymous payments. Should we be so keen to abandon cash entirely? 
Are we okay with tech companies and banks knowing everything we purchase, where we spend, who we spend with then selling that data on or using it to target us with advertisements and content? Are we okay with governments implementing large scale warrantless #FinancialSurveillance operations on the populace? Are we okay with our spending and saving data being used to score, rate, rank us in everything from job applications to dating profiles? 
What starts out as laws to restrict money laundering and terrorist financing can easily become a financial snoopers charter. 
If we are not okay with all this then what checks and balances can be put in place? 
Based on the above scenario create a video on  “Good Bye Cash …”
