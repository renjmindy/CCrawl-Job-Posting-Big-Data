 The Macro Markets & Alternative Data group develops and maintains systems to ingest, enrich, store, distribute and analyze data on Macroeconomics, Commodities, Foreign Exchange, and Futures & Options. Additionally, the group is responsible for Bloomberg NEF product, and we are building out a new platform for Alternative Data. We strive for our tools to provide timely, accurate, complete, and authoritative data that seamlessly integrates into multiple market players' workflows. 
 Some of the different areas within Macro Markets & Alternative Data that you can join include: 
 Commodities build products that offer transparency in supply, demand, and pricing of oil, power, natural gas, metals and agricultural goods. We build systems and functionality to house everything from hourly power transmission rates to 15-minute updates on ship movements. We also build and maintain pricing engines that generate Real Time market Fair Value prices of over 700 commodity curves covering the major commodity asset classes. Technical opportunities run the gamut from architecting systems to designing databases to UI development. Another aspect of this group is to track and manage the lifecycle of millions of securities across 100+ exchanges around the world. Our Commodities product makes discoverability of such securities easy, which proves to be very important for our clients in a dynamic environment. 
 Foreign Exchange (FX Core) designs and builds a business-critical solution. FX core focuses on ensuring the production of pricing sources, enhancing terminal workflows and extending reach to enterprise level support for executable source delivery and benchmarks. Our customers use our FX data for trade execution, derivative valuation, scenario analysis, risk management, and portfolio benchmarking. Our Clients demand a high quality of pricing feeds. We focus on building products being able to handle extremely high volumes while maintaining low latencies & high availability. You will have the opportunity to design, develop and implement a vision and strategy for Bloomberg FX Products. 
 NSD and Taxonomy builds products to generalize and improve the efficiency of onboarding content, taxonomizing it, and making it available to application developers and serving clients. We create, integrate and stitch solutions with and from diverse teams and open source projects to craft solutions that can be applied to a range of sectors, including Commodities, Economics and Equities, thanks to the universal need to handle data beyond traded securities. 
 Futures and Options (F&O;) are responsible for critical application infrastructure for managing the lifecycles and data of millions of exchange-traded derivatives, and for presenting that data in a clear and comprehensive manner. These financial instruments include futures, options, and strategies on a wide variety of non-equity products ranging from commodities like crude oil, crops, and metals to financial derivatives like interest rates, bonds, and currency exchange rates. Every day new derivatives are listed, actively-traded ones are updated, and old ones are delisted via multiple and heterogeneous data streams. Our team is responsible for automating the creation, update, and deletion of these instruments. The accuracy and reliability of the data we manage is vital for many areas of Bloomberg and our clients. In addition to maintaining infrastructure that ensures high-quality, high-availability, low-latency data under a load of billions of requests per day, our team also owns client-facing analytics that provide information to help our Terminal & Enterprise clients with such things as pricing of Crude Oil or Platinum option contracts, hedging of Chinese Yuan vs US Dollar, and the spread between two NYSE Indexes.
