 A few hours after publishing your job post you'll receive a confirmation email sent by our Support team stating that your job complies with  job board regulations  and is being sent to the job sites listed under the **Find Candidates  **tab in the Free Job boards, and any premium boards if selected. 
 While waiting for the email, visit the Find Candidates tab of the job editor and make sure to fix any alerts that indicate additional actions required for the posting to go live: 
 12-36 hours after receiving the approval email, check the  Workable job board  and search for your company. If your job is live, sit back, relax and expect some candidates to appear in your Workable pipeline soon. Applicants will be able to find and apply to your jobs. 
 If after a few days or so you notice that you do not receive candidates from a particular source, please  contact Support  for assistance.
