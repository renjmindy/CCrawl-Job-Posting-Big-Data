 Do I need to create accounts on job boards to post?

 Workable has built-in integrations with over 200 free and premium job boards. You will not need to create accounts on these job boards to post to them - everything can be handled through Workable. 
 However, if you already have accounts with certain job boards you can link those accounts to Workable. For example, if you've already purchased job slots on Monster before coming to Workable, link that account to use your purchased job slots through Workable. This keeps the job posting process quick and easy. 
 Admins can connect accounts by clicking their profile icon in the upper right of Workable, clicking on 'Settings' and navigating to the   Integrations  section.
