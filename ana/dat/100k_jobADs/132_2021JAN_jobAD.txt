 When Your Day Job Owns Your Soulâ€¦ 
 RenÃ© S. Garcia, Jr. *January 20, 2008 
 When I was a kid, I never thought about the delicate balance of work-life and personal-life. I watched my parents go to work in the morning and then they came home when it got dark and we were a family. The end. Even when I started working as a teenager, my day job (or night job, depending on the hours) was just that - something I did during a certain time of day to pay the bills - and it never spilled into any other parts of my life, unless I wanted it to. Now that I'm on my career path, it's amazing how much my job has devoured my "free time." For the past couple of weeks, I haven't had a day off. Moreover, every day was an 11- or 12-hour shift. 
 Let me just say now that people were not meant to put in these kinds of hours. Anyway, I haven't had the time to blog, because I've been understandably drained whenever I get home. That's not to say I don't have things to talk about. On the contrary, I've still done my best to get out and about to keep my creative side from drying up. So, now that the hectic-ness of my day job has calmed down, I can spare a few hours writing about what's going on my life. Look for some gigantic posts in the coming week. Until then, thanks for checking in on the blog. I know that you dedicated are out there lurking (you come up on my Web stats) and I want you to know that I appreciate you. 
 I'll catch up with all of you soon.
