 Make Your Career Dream a Reality 
 Last week, you thought "I wish--", then quickly squashed your wish. 
 “Too ambitious,” the voice in your head whispered. 
 ""You need to settle for what you've got." 
 "It's too big a risk." 
 "You'll fail." 
 "You can't accomplish that." 
 You listened. The voices, like Velcro, hooked doubts, and you tossed your dream over the reality cliff. 
 Except, a piece of the dream wafted up, lingered in the air. Perhaps you want to run your own business; land a higher paying, more exciting job, or retire by 50.  Maybe you want your boss’s job or to make all the money you need to live on while working only twenty hours weekly.  Whatever the dream, you don't want to let it go. 
 So, go get it. 
 Face what stops you. 
 Do you feel you’re not good enough?  Or that you might not succeed and so don’t try? Guess what?  You’re the author of your mental conversations and can create new ones.  How about telling yourself, “When I establish a goal I really want and commit to it, nothing can stop me.”   Anything you see someone else achieve, you can – by believing in yourself and releasing your mental parking brake.

 Dream large 
 Those who hesitate to dream big neutralize the power of a dream.  In the same way that the chance to win an Olympic medal keeps an athlete performing at peak levels despite exhaustion, by dreaming large you kindle adrenaline. 
 Remember those days when you rocked at work or when playing competitive sports? Adrenaline and commitment powered those days.  You can have those days every day – if you fuel your energy with an inspiring dream.  So name your dream and then move it from twilight to daybreak

 Stop your sabotage. 
 Do you wait overlong for the right moment to start?  So fear risks that you settle for “good enough?” If you want to achieve your dreams, uproot the ways in which you undermine yourself. 
 If you fear risk, consider which feels worse – risking and failing or selling yourself out by giving up before you start? What do you want said at your retirement? – “S/he took a risk and won” or “whoops, maybe next lifetime.”

 Dedicate. 
 You know what I mean – think of all the individuals who make a New Year’s resolution to stop smoking yet add, “Unless I really need the cigarette.”  Don’t sell yourself out. 
 Commitment creates the difference between achieving what you want and “if only I’d….” To bring a large dream into reality you need to step up to the plate and take action. 
 Action transforms you from someone who can “talk a good story” into someone who lives a good story. Bring your dream to life.
