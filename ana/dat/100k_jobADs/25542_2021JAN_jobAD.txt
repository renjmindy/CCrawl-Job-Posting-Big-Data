 Job: Information Services Specialist - Circulation 
 Posted on  December 11, 2013  by   sarahgprescott 
 12/10/13 -  Information Services Specialist - Circulation 
Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar, Doha 
 Sarah P 's comments : I have watched the development of Doha's Education City since its inception in 2002. Jobs regularly appear and are filled but the process is vague and the length of time to hire very slow. Salaries are good and Doha is safe but recently has been trending toward becoming conservative. I believe that Weill Cornell list jobs looking to hire someone already in the country as a spouse and only if they cannot fill the position do they then hire from overseas.
