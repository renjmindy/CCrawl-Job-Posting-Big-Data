 Travel with the people you love. Group travel has never been this easy - check out our homes and locations across the country. Collectively, we‚Äôve traveled to over 80 countries and know what matters most - creating an authentic experience. We believe the best travel accommodations are all about delivering an exceptional, unique stay and far too often property managers and hosts fall short on delivering a first-class short-term rental experience. AvantStay is here to change that by setting the new standard for short-term rental experiences. Our team is incredibly passionate about real estate, technology and the arts. We came together to build a revolutionary hospitality brand through the power of virtual tech automation in the short-term rental market. With offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles, we currently operate in 7 markets across the United States. Our proprietary tech algorithm and data experts identify partnership opportunities and automate operations through our virtual management system to maximize efficiencies and improve the overall guest experience.
