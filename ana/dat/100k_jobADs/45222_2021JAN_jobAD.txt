 I need an animated opening sequence with our the text, "Patriot Morning Minute". The style of the animation and text should be just like School House Rock. This animation needs to be drawn, not pulled from the Internet...it must be original using that style. The intro should be about 30 seconds. Here is an example of a style of opening that I am looking for: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRuh9aBwUdM We start with an Eagle flying through the sky and landing on the flagpole, follow the flagpole down showing the American Flag and a Kite with a Key flying in the air, continue down to Benjamin Franklin holding the string of the kite. As you Pan out all the other elements come into the scene. We see the Capitol Building, the Statue of Liberty rises out from behind the Capitol, a Model T honks and pulls up in the lower left frame, Rosie the Riveter rises up from behind the right side of the capitol. Jackie Robinson steps into frame on the right side and hits a baseball toward the viewer. Uncle Sam, George Washington, Martin Luther King looking like he is speaking, Cesar Chavez holding a sign reading "United Farm Workers", Elvis Presley who strums his guitar once, Abraham Lincoln, Fredrick Douglas, Mark Twain, Albert Einstein, Ronald Reagan, Alexander Hamilton, Walt Disney, Betsy Ross sewing the flag, and Thomas Edison (a light bulb pops in above his head). These images should fill in the bottom half of the screen while fireworks fill the sky above. Then the Wright Brother's Plane come from the right side of the sky followed by the Space Shuttle coming up through the middle which takes us up to the moon and and an astronaut with NASA on his outfit floating in space. Thomas Edison will then pull a string on the light bulb over his head and the screen will go black for a second and show our Logo "Patriot Morning Minute" in School House Rock style font. All character have to be created from scratch using School House Rock as the style of character and design. We will need to approve each character and item before animating. Watch the School House Rock videos to get ideas and to understand the style and design I want... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqvLi7qZ_yU This will need to be in an MP4 or .mov format when submitting. Please submit any examples that fit in this genre of work. I will be very particular about the work done. I have attached a drawing that I did to represent what it should look like with some of the characters and layout... Thank you, David Van Wie (removed) (removed)
