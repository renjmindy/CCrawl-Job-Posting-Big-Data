 Hi all, 
 This week has been an eventful week on the job front, with a truck load of job announcements. Before I go into the announcements, let me tell you how I find out about them, it might help you in your own job search! 
 The bulk of large scale job announcements are coming from FDI , Foreign Direct Investment. This is managed via the IDA, some history  here . Check out the  newsroom  or subscribe to their  monthly Ezine  .  The best place  I found to get an overview of all job announcements in Ireland is on  the Irish National Organisations of the unemployed , the INOU, on their  jobswatch  page. Also check out the  client jobs  on the  Enterprise Ireland  website. 
 Some companies will recruit directly, others will use recruitment agencies, or job search engines, but it all starts where the jobs are created, and the closer you can get to the source, the better ðŸ˜Ž . 
 To not hold you any longer in suspense.. drum rollâ€¦. here they come !
