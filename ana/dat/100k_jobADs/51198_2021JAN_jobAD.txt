 Medical billing and coding jobs from home offer a chance to build an out-of-the-cubicle career in healthcare. In fact, this remote-friendly career path is so in-demand that the  Bureau of Labor and Statistics  estimates it'll grow  much faster  than average! 
 Some estimates even suggest there are 50% more medical billing and coding jobs than there are professionals to fill them! 
 A recent  CNBC video  highlights this labor gap of medical coders in a  Where The Jobs Are  report. Needless to say, with the right training under your belt, you can enter this wide-open professional field and secure steady employment. 
 And, because many of the job responsibilities can be done using just a computer and Internet connection, there are a number of medical billing and coding jobs from home. 
 Interested? Let's look at this hugely in-demand remote career path and how you can get started (even if you have no experience). 
 What is Medical Billing and Coding? 
 The healthcare industry as a whole is booming. If you've always been interested in a career in healthcare but can't stand the sight of blood or didn't want to go to school for years to get a degree and certification, medical coding may be right up your alley. 
 You see, medical billing and coding specialists play an important role in the financial side of healthcare. They review patients' records and assign codes to procedures and diagnoses. These codes are used by medical providers to bill insurance companies, patients, and government agencies (think Medicaid and Medicare). 
 To keep things consistent, the entire industry uses three standard code sets. These are known as CPT, HCPCS, and ICD-10. 
 The information you extract from records becomes a part of a patient's medical history. So accuracy and confidentiality are key! 
 Medical Billing and Coding Pay 
 Medical billing and coding jobs are known to pay pretty darn good. According to the  Bureau of Labor and Statistics , the median pay in 2016 was $38,040 per year or about $18.29 per hour. Not too bad for a remote healthcare job that doesn't require a degree! 
 Medical Billing and Coding Certification 
 We know that medical billing and coding is an in-demand profession. But it's not something you can just jump into. While you don't need a degree, you will need post-secondary training. Once you complete training, it is often recommended to seek industry certification. (A good training program will prepare you for both your career and certification). 
 As an entry-level medical billing and coding pro, there are two industry certifications to consider. The first is the Certified Professional Coder (CPC) offered by the  American Academy of Professional Coders  (AAPC). The other is Certified Coding Associate (CCA) offered by  American Health Information Management Association  (AHIMA). 
 Although certification isn't necessarily a prerequisite of employment, it can make you a desirable hire in the eyes of employers. But before you even think about gaining certification, you'll need to go through training. Remember, a good program will set you up for success in your career and will prepare you to seek certification post-graduation. 
 Medical Billing and Coding Training 
 The  Online Medical Billing and Coding Certification Training Program at CareerStep  prepares students to work as a medical billing and coding specialist AND obtain certification after graduating. Did I mention you can do it all entirely online in as little as four months? It's true. Full-time students can complete training in a few short months and be one step closer to securing employment. 
 And because Career Step has developed relationships with employers over the years, many of their graduates have jobs immediately following graduation. There are even opportunities for remote employment! 
 With Career Step, you'll have the knowledge and skills to increase your earning potential as a medical billing and coding pro. 
 To learn more about the many benefits of the training program and how you can enroll, visit the  Career Step career and education training page .

 Hi Ashlee,

 Hi Ashley! 
 I just passed my CPC exam and looking for a job preferably remote. Do you have any information about which companies hire new coders and is it hard finding a job in this field being a new coder? 
 
 Ashlee Anderson  says

 Hi Deanna, 
 Congratulations! That's great that you have passed your CPC. From what I have heard, it is not necessarily difficult to find a job as a new coder. In fact, there is a shortage of coders so there are often more job vacancies that trained professionals, like you, to fill them. 
 I heard great things about Lexicode. They have an entire remote division for coding pros. Have you looked into them?  https://www.talento.io/eFpWorkplace/newcareers.do

 Hi everyone! 
I recently graduated with my CPC. I have been looking for something remote and part-time. I also work as an LPN and have a 4 year old at home on my days off and would like to be home and work as well if possible. Its proving to be a bit harder to find something than I thought! Anyone have any input? 
Anything would be great! 
Thank you!!

 Hello, I found very little information in that coding-specific forum other than reich-wing propaganda and people complaining about pay or lay-offs. I am sad now.
