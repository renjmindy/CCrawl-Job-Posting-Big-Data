 JOY on the JOB 
 Posted on  August 1, 2014  by [OnesimusConnection - "A Journey in Self Discovery"](https://onesimusconnection.wordpress.com/author/onesimusconnection/ "View all posts by OnesimusConnection - "A Journey in Self Discovery"") 
 
 “Joy on the Job”? … HHmmmm … sounds like a contradiction. One survey conducted in 2012 showed that “Only 19% said they were satisfied with their jobs. Another 16% said they were “somewhat satisfied.” But the rest, nearly two-thirds of respondents, said they were not happy at work”*. 
 To be honest, from what I hear by “word-of-mouth”, I’m surprised the survey showed that high of a number of people satisfied with their work. Nonetheless … the majority of people are not happy with their job. 
 SO … having said that … is “Joy on the Job” even possible? I am 65 now and, like many Americans, still working. I have worked a number of jobs over the years and I will admit … the majority of them I did not like. Somehow though, I have always found “Joy on the Job” which helped me to not “hate my job” … and actually made it possible for me to enjoy going to work every day. How was that possible? Well … here are a THREE SIMPLE THINGS I did which changed my glass from being “half empty” to “half full”: 
 
 Life is a journey … as is your employment. It is constantly evolving and changing. No job is “forever” … even the ones which you enjoy. SO … when I had a job I did not like very well, I reminded myself that this is only “temporary” and that there is something better around the corner (either with this job or a new one) … so just hold on … it will get better. 
 This job, as with any job, is meeting the needs that are important in my life. Needs of my family … my personal life … my recreational needs … the things that really matter to me. At times it seems like there isn’t enough money … BUT … if I adjusted my lifestyle to what I NEED and not what I WANT … AND … If I keep a proper perspective of what is really important and what I really value in life … I will be much happier and I will find joy in life and joy in the job that allows that to happen. 
 Find something “pleasurable” about your job. It can be a variety of things from something “specific” about your job you find pleasure in … even if it is just the satisfaction that you are doing your best. OR … It can be something not necessarily related to your work … like quiet time to think of meditate … to finding new friends … to learning new things in life … or just developing new character traits which this employment is developing in your life. 
 
 These are the THREE THINGS which I did over the years … and still do … which brought “Joy on the Job” … and they work … IF YOU WORK THEM.
