 Photographer captures National Guard soldiers in civilian workplaces | Lewiston Sun Journal 
 Posted on  May 17, 2010  |  Leave a comment 
 
 On a 4-degree January morning, Buddy Doyle pulled off the road to wish a random soldier luck in Iraq. 
 “We argue to this day who initiated the long, lingering hug,” said Doyle of Gardiner. “I told him, 'Take care of yourself. Don't do anything stupid.'” 
 A year and a half after that chance meeting near the National Guard armory in Gardiner, when the soldier had returned home, Doyle looked the guy up. 
 “I had told him I wanted to shake his hand,” he said. “I still did.” 
 He had another goal, too. 
 A photographer, writer and designer, Doyle had spent years creating glossy calenders of firefighters. Now he hatched a plan to take portraits of reservists guard members at their civilian jobs. He wanted the soldier's help.

 Stuff about me 
 
 
 My name is Keith Michaud and this is “Letters From Away,” a blog written by a Mainer living outside the comfortable and sane confines of New England. The blog is intended for Mainers, whether they live in the Pine Tree State or beyond, and for anyone who has loved ’em, been baffled by ’em or both. Ayuh, I am “from away.” Worse still, I live on the Left Coast – in California. Enjoy! Or not. Your choice.
