 Career Crossroads Workshop 
 
 My Career Crosswords workshop will help you get clear, confident and committed to the right career choice for you. It's a one-day, interactive session held in Berlin and Paris packed full of activities and exercises that will help you to work out: 
 
 How to reconnect to the 'working you' again and boost your confidence and motivation. 
 What you need and want (or don't want) from a future career. 
 The skills, strengths and expertise you have to offer. 
 The practical and emotional issues that are getting in the way of taking your next career step and how you can overcome them. 
 Your possible career options and how to explore them. 
 A personalised Career Change Action Plan guaranteed to get you where you want to be in your life and career. 
 
 
 Who is the workshop for? 
 ​The workshop is particularly designed for you if you: 
 
 Are on maternity leave or an extended career break and re-assessing your career options. Do you want to change jobs or careers, start your own business, set up as a freelancer or go back to school? 
 Are in work but your current work situation is no longer a good fit and you would like to try something new. 
 You're not planning to work for a while, but would like to consider future options and make the most of your maternity leave / career break. 
 
 
 Where and when?
