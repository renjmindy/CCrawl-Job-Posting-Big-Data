 What is a dentist? 
 Dentists are responsible for anything regarding the health of the mouth, including the teeth, gums and dental tissues. They need to be licensed to perform their duties. Note that dentist education requirements may differ from country to country or from state to state. 
 What does a dentist do? 
 Dentists can be general practitioners or specialize in specific areas (e.g. pediatric dentists, endodontists and periodontists). In this case, they’ll need to develop specific dentist skills. Often, they’re required to complete additional studies. 
 General dentist duties include: 
 
 Conducting oral screenings to identify diseases and infections 
 Removing tooth decay and plaque 
 Applying prosthetics, sealers and whiteners 
 
 Job brief 
 We are looking for a Dentist to diagnose, treat and advise our patients on various dental issues. 
 You’ll need to have experience treating a range of teeth and gum problems, from simple cases like removing plaque to more complex procedures (e.g. placing dental implants). 
 Ultimately, you’ll promote good oral health and help patients apply preventive dental care.

 Identify tooth decay and replace cavities with fillings 
 Design and fit dental prosthetics, such as bridges, crowns and dentures 
 Apply teeth-whitening treatments 
 Conduct tooth extractions and root canal procedures 
 Perform surgeries on diseased tissues and bones 
 Prescribe medication as needed 
 Educate patients on proper brushing techniques, flossing and fluoride use 
 Promote good oral health and preventive dental care (e.g. by scheduling regular check-ups)

 In-depth understanding of dental hygiene 
 Experience with dental equipment and tools 
 Experience with surgeries and teeth extractions 
 A pleasant and compassionate personality with the ability to make patients feel comfortable
