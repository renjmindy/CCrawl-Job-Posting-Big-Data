 Expert Advice on How to Relaunch your Career 
 by  Ciara Garvan  | Feb 5, 2020 |  VIDEO  |  0 comments 
 Love this Ted Talk about Relaunching your Career. Think it has some great points about how lots of very successful people can take time out for whatever reason, be it raising children or a healthcare issue and come back and be really valuable workers. 
 Carol Fishman Cohen shares some great pointers in the video; 
 
 Tell  EVERYONE  you are looking for a job. This is one people (especially Irish people!!) often overlook. They are embarrassed or don't want to bother people. Nothing could be further then the truth. Most people are happy to help- if they know you are looking in the first place! 
 Consider returner programmes. There are some programmes in Ireland and they are a great opportunity to get some real experience and get a feel for a company without committing full time. 
 Take courses and get back up to speed. Companies can sometimes have a "fear factor" about taking people on who have been out of the workforce for a long time. This is one area which you can take responsibility for and take action.
