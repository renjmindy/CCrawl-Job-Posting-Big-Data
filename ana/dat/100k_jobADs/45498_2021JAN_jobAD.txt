 Indigenous Policy Jobs 
 Posted on  October 12, 2007  by  andrewleigh 
 My former econ masters student Kirsten Storry is standing down from her position as indigenous policy researcher at the Centre for Independent Studies to take up a job in a Sydney law firm. It's good for the law, but a pity for the issue, since Kirsten is an evidence-driven researcher who has written a  number   of   careful   pieces Â  recently . The CIS are now advertising for a couple of new Kirstens, and the ad is over the fold. 
 
 INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS POLICY RESEARCHERS 
 The Centre for Independent Studies (CIS) is Australiaâ€™s leading independent policy think tank dealing with economic, foreign and social policy issues.Â We are seeking two full-time researchers based at St Leonards, Sydney to continue our influential work on economic and social issues affecting indigenous communities in Australia and the Torres Strait Islands.Â Applicants should have a good degree from any relevant discipline and should be able to show evidence of research competence.Â Post graduate qualifications would be an advantage.Â Preference will be given to people with work experience in a research or policy background. 
 The position will involve undertaking research into the challenges facing indigenous communities, developing policy recommendations for the social and economic development of those communities and promoting widespread discussion among indigenous communities and the general public.Â Areas of focus will include education, health, housing and governance.Â The successful applicant will be self motivated, have good writing and speaking skills, and will be able to prepare innovative materials for presentation and publication.Â Familiarity with the work of CIS  www.cis.org.au  and sympathy for its objectives are highly desirable.Â Candidates are advised to read recent articles (available on the website) produced by CIS authors working in this area.Â This position is for a term of 2 years in the first instance.Â 
Salary is available on request.
