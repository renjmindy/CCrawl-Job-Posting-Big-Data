 Careers 
 Bilingual Consultant, Data Analyst 
 Make a difference! 
 Workforce Edge helps our healthcare clients implement effective staff scheduling practices. Over 70% of healthcare budgets are spent on staffing, and organizations depend on having an engaged and skilled workforce to deliver quality patient care for all Canadians. Our projects improve the working life for employees and reduce the cost of delivering care. 
 We are looking for a Consultant & Data Analyst who is bilingual (English/French) and has past experience scheduling for a 24/7 workforce or involved in the HR/LR aspects of staff scheduling. This could include past positions as a scheduler, scheduling clerk, scheduling analyst, workforce analyst, or similar positions in HR or workforce planning in industries such as health care, airlines, manufacturing, or IT. 
 As a Workforce Edge Consultant: 
 We have always been a remote team, and most days will be spent working at your home office, connecting with consultants across Canada and with client contacts by phone, email, and online meetings. Your normal activities will be to analyze client payroll and schedule data and prepare tables and charts, contribute to reviews of schedules and scheduling practices, design and QA schedules, support business process improvements, and prepare draft reports and presentations. You will also contribute to continuous improvements of our tools and methodologies. 
Attendance at internal and client meetings by telephone/online meeting will be required daily to clarify data, present and review draft deliverables, record client input, and support senior consultants by documenting discussion items and action items. Occasionally, you will travel to client sites, working with senior consultants to record the results of interviews and focus groups, support process design, training and implementation activities, and participate in other on-site meetings and activities. On average, business travel is 3-4 days duration and most consultants complete between 6-12 trips per year (although during the COVID pandemic, we are not requiring travel to client sites).
