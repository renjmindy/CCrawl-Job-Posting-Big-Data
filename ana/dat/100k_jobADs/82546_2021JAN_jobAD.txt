 JOB SEEKERS FIND SUSTAINABLE EMPLOYMENT WITH MOLEX 
 In January of 2019 Molex contacted the Business Service Team with the Central Arkansas Workforce Development Area to inquire about assistance with recruiting for eight (8) opened Plating Setup Operator positions at their facility in Maumelle, Arkansas. 
 As a result, the Business Service Team and Molex decided to host the “Meet Up with Molex” event, where potential prospects could come learn about Molex, what their hiring needs were, and possibly be hired. On February 12, 2019, the Arkansas Workforce Center in Conway assisted Molex with the two informational sessions scheduled to accommodate the needs of Molex and job seekers. 
 Over 30 individuals attended the event and Molex was able to fill all of their open positions, with a starting salary of $17.89 per hour, providing sustainable wages for their new employees. 
 Molex expressed satisfaction with the services provided by the Business Service Team and looks forward to future projects.
