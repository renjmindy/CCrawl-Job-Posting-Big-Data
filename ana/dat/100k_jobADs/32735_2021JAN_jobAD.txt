 Dear native English speakers, 
 Does this sentence sound correct? 
 Now that I'm 21, it's time to start looking for a full time 
job for after I graduate. 
 Thanks in advance.

 As you know, Hirashin, you should ask about a specific part of the sentence when you ask about something you have written. We don't check work for mistakes. 
 Is there a word choice you are wondering about? Do you have a question about the tense? And so on. Once you give us something to focus on, people will try to help.

 Sorry. I wanted to ask about the word "for" in the sentence. 
 (a) Now that I'm 21, it's time to start looking for a full time 
job for after I graduate. 
 If it were (b), I would not have a question about the sentence. 
 (b) Now that I'm 21, it's time to start looking for a full time 
job after I graduate. 
 If (a) is also correct, what does "for" mean? 
 Thanks in advance.

 (a) works. It means that because I'm now 21, it's time to start looking for a full-time job that I will be able to start after I graduate. The second "for" implies "to meet a need": I have no need for a job now, but I will need one after I graduate. 
(b) doesn't work because it is doesn't make sense: It mentions two moments when I should look for this job - now and after I graduate.
