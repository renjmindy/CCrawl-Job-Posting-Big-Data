 Enables farmers to share and access information using Clojure! 
 Role overview 
 About Us 
 Wefarm is the world‚Äôs largest platform  connecting the small-scale farming community  üåæMillions of farmers, retailers, and brands come together on Wefarm to grow their businesses üöú 
 Small-scale farming is one of the largest and most important industries in the world, with over one billion people globally involved in it üåçWe‚Äôre working towards connecting this community  so small-scale farmers can gain a better position in global agricultural supply chains.  Some of the world‚Äôs leading VCs are backing us on this mission, including True Ventures in Silicon Valley. 
 Since our launch in 2015,  we‚Äôve grown to serve over two million farmers  across Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. Our platform has facilitated the (free) exchange of over 18 million messages to share knowledge, generated over $5 million in marketplace sales, and sold nearly half a million products. 
 So far, we‚Äôve partnered with 100+ brands to give our members fair prices on the quality products they are looking for. 
 Our next milestone is to have  100 million farmers  benefiting from Wefarm üìàJoin us and be part of our mission to build an ecosystem for global agriculture, with the farmer at the centre.. 
 The Role 
 You operate within a cross-functional squad and work very closely with a Tech Lead, Product Manager and Designer to make sure we're solving challenges that will bring the greatest value to our members. You help design product & UX tests that give us the data we need to bring learnings into our scalable solutions. You propose innovative solutions, help steer the squad to the most impactful solutions and work with the other Engineers to drive their implementation, maintenance and support. 
 You will be held accountable for the success of the technology and the quality of the engineering behind the products being developed and focus on the following outcomes 
 Outcome 1: Squad goals are achieved through: 
 
 Understanding the squad OKRs and priorities 
 Clear and consistent communication and collaboration 
 Working with the other Engineers to drive rapid delivery 
 Building test results into our scalable solutions 
 A pragmatic approach to project agility 
 
 Outcome 2: Quality technical execution 
 
 Produce clean well documented idiomatic code 
 Makes sure the technical design is simple and scalable 
 Comfortable using Git 
 An attention to detail 
 Job requirements 
 You should apply if you 
 Are driven to create the most innovative, impactful products and get them into the hands of our members 
 Have experience or desire to be within a cross-functional team in an Agile environment 
 Understand how to use data to inform key product and technical decisions 
 Have a bias towards delivery 
 Are comfortable working in an environment of rapid growth, constant change, and uncertainty 
 Bring a positive energy to your team and a passion for tech-for-good, and improving other people‚Äôs lives 
 Are proficient in Clojure, Kafka, relational databases and developing web applications 
 Communicate and articulate yourself effectively 
 Enjoy learning new things 
 Are a problem solver 
 Believe Lego should be shared 
 
 This isn't for you if 
 
 You can't operate without top-down direction. You'll be expected to determine the highest impact areas to work on, collaborating with your squad and manager to ensure there's alignment. 
 You bring an oversized ego. Our decisions focus on what is right, not who is right. 
 Or if you're not comfortable with ambiguity, don't have speed as a habit or are uncomfortable with changing org structures and squads every 6 months (at least) 
 You aren't able to align behind Wefarm's culture and values 
 
 Equal Opportunity Statement 
 At Wefarm, we‚Äôre building a place where everyone belongs and can add value, regardless of their background - and our team is no different. We‚Äôre working hard to create a diverse and inclusive culture where we take inspiration from different experiences, backgrounds and ways of thinking. If you share our values and enthusiasm for connecting the world‚Äôs small-scale farmers, you may be a great fit for Wefarm.

 Over 1 billion smallholder farmers produce 80% of the world's food, and four of the five most traded commodities on earth, yet the vast majority lack access to the internet and even basic information to help them solve problems or share ideas. No one has built a platform for these farmers. Until Wefarm. Wefarm is already the world‚Äôs largest farmer-to-farmer digital network, with more than 1 million farmers using our ecosystem in Kenya and Uganda alone. Our farmers share more than 40,000 questions and answers every day. Farmers connect with one another to solve problems, share ideas, and spread innovation, for free, and without needing an internet connection (Wefarm works even through SMS). Utilising the latest machine learning technology, Wefarm‚Äôs service gets bespoke, crowd- sourced information to help farmers increase yields, gain insight into pricing, tackle the effects of climate change, source the best quality seeds, fertiliser, and loans and diversify their agricultural interests. With the smallholder global agricultural market valued at over 400 billion USD, our vision is to create a digital online/ offline ecosystem for global smallholder agriculture. WeFarm has won Google‚Äôs prestigious Impact Challenge Award, the MEFFYS Award for Innovation in Technology, the Messaging and SMS World Awards‚Äô Best SMS Solution, Business Rocks‚Äô Global Startup Pitch Battle, Chivas Regal‚Äôs The Venture Competition‚Äôs UK prize, and 2nd place in their Global final and the European Union Commission‚Äôs Ideas from Europe Prize.
