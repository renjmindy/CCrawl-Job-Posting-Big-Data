 When Nature has a work to do 
She creates a genius for the do 
Microsoft a thought for the ill 
Bill made his bill and took to the hill. 
 When Nature has a work to do 
She creates a genius for the do 
No such escape for such mark 
Facebook has a mark a very large ark. 
 When Nature work is done 
So soon, she off a genius on 
Apple not an apple anymore 
Steve Jobs did his job then she knocked.
