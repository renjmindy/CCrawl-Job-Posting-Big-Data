 Maximize Your Salary: How to handle the question every job seeker hates! 
 September 7, 2017 / 
 Fee-Only CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER Practitioner Lauren Zangardi Haynes 
 There's one question all job seekers hate- "what is your current salary?" If you are interviewing for a new job I have some good news -  in some areas of the U.S. this question is illegal . 
 Unfortunately, a lot of job seekers are still going to have to deal with this tricky question. 
 This question really bothers me and as a Certified Financial Planner Professional I want to help my clients not only grow the money they have already saved but maximize what may be their largest asset - their earning power! 
 With that in mind, I spoke with two of my friends who are truly HR rockstars having built successful careers in Fortune 500 companies and they have some great tips for you! 
 Check out the video below for their advice. It will be the most valuable 1.5 minutes you spend all day today.
