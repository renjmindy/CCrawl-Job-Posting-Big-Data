 Job 25 
 1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 
 2 Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places. 
 3 Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise? 
 4 How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman? 
 5 Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight. 
 6 How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is a worm?

 Who is able to count his heavenly army? Doesn’t his light shine on all the earth? 
Job 25:3 NLT 
 We may not be able to count His heavenly armies, but this we know: there are twice as many for us as are against us! 
 And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them. And Elisha prayed, and said, Lord , I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.

 Job 25

“Dominion and awe belong to God; 
He establishes peace and order in His high places. 
 There is no God like our God!!!! 
His peace goes beyond all human understanding. His glory ! 
 Psalms 97 
The Lord reigns; let the earth rejoice; 
let the many coastlands be glad! 
2 Clouds and thick darkness are round about him; 
righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne. 
3 Fire goes before him, 
and burns up his adversaries round about. 
4 His lightnings lighten the world; 
the earth sees and trembles.

 Verses 1-2 MSG "Bildad the Shuhite again attacked Job: “God is sovereign, God is fearsome—everything in the cosmos fits and works in his plan." Daniel 4:35 CEV says "To him the nations are far less than nothing; God controls the stars in the sky and everyone on this earth. When God does something, we cannot change it or even ask why.” God is in control of all things and has created all things according to his plan.

 2. Dominion and awe belong to God; he establishes order in the heights of heaven. 
 3. Can his forces be numbered? On whom does his light not rise? NIV 
 There is nowhere you can go that God cannot reach you. 
Some might only think of this as there being nowhere to hide and get away from God, but it also means that those that weren’t trying to get away from God but still find themselves lost and in despair, not sure how they got where they are, still have hope! God can reach down to wherever you are and pull you out with His mercy and love!

 “God is more glorious than the moon; he shines brighter than the stars. In comparison, people are maggots; we mortals are mere worms.”” 
‭‭Job‬ ‭25:5-6‬ ‭NLT‬‬ 
 Let’s not forget who the almighty is. When God uses us we’re just the vessel folks we’re just the willing vessel and nothing more. It’s Jesus we need to glorify, yes you can say it’s true he’s using you for healing or he’s using you to pray for folks, but God is who gets the glory. There is no one else like the Lord in all the earth.

 God is faithful and just to forgive us, all we have to do is ask, and we need to be baptized with water and FIRE! Are we perfect from then on? NO, but we are clean. There isnt anyway to justify our sin, there isnt need for excuses, Sin is sin, and the time spent trying to justify our actions, and make excuses, we could be repenting and making things right with God!

 Then Bildad the Shuhite replied: “God is powerful and dreadful. He enforces peace in the heavens. Who is able to count his heavenly army? Doesn’t his light shine on all the earth? 
Job 25:1‭-‬3 NLT 
 https://bible.com/bible/116/job.25.1-3.NLT 
 God's army is by far the largest in the universe. There is none that can stand against Him. I know all that I have to do is call out His name and He will send a battalion of Angel's to protect me. Should I fear God; oh yes. He is the ultimate judge; should I mess up before standing before God then that's it; I will not enter the Kingdom. He will always shine brighter than the sun and the stars. His light will always shine on all the earth. This is God's place for all His children. So then why here and now? The time has come for me to make the ultimate choice of which for me is one option. Choose God and the Kingdom to serve. Let me be a light in the darkness on this rock. Thank you Jesus.

 Job 25:4 [Amp] How then can man be justified and righteous before God ? Or how can he who be pure and clean ? [ Ps 130:3] If you , Lord, should keep account of and treat [ us according to our sins, O Lord, who could ? [ Ps. 143: 2 ] And enter not into judgment with Your servant, For in Your sight no man living is [ in himself] righteous or justified. The Lord takes pleasure in those who reverently and worshipfully fear Him. In those who hope in His mercy and lovingkindness. I fear the Lord ! I pray today that you would open eyes and hearts of people from the north , south , east, and west. Send a great revival to them. Great is our Lord and greatly to be Praise.

 4 How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman? 
 Out of the things that were said by Job's friends, this one holds the most truth.the word tells us that even in our most righteous moments we are as filthy rags. while yes, God does treasure us and love us deeply, we can only be justified thru Christ, we need Jesus for everything we have and go through.

 iLove the Kingdom 
As I read these few verses a couple things came to mind. This is the same way the Jews treated Jesus when He healed on the Sabbath and broke their traditions. 
 4 How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman? 5 Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight. 6 How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is a worm? 
 They could not possibly understand how Jesus could make himself "equal" to God. Joh 5:18 Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God. 
 These folks should have gotten their faces into the book…if they would have known the scriptures, it wouldn't have been so hard to believe. The same is true with us today, we need to become Bible Book Worms.

 More than just a worm 
 6How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is a worm? 
 Say this with me, " I am more than just a worm." Sounds kinda silly. But when you think that God created us from dirt, hmmm, makes you think. However, we are more than just dirt. God almighty formed us with his hands and breathed into us life. He spoke everything else into existence, yet he took the time to form us. 
Just because it's taking time for you to grow, doesnt mean your over. Just because you feel the pressure of his hands modeling you, doesnt mean something is wrong. He is forming us individually into what he wants us to be. 
Worms are good for two things. 1. To agitate the soil so that nutrients and air can penetrate the soil, and 2. For fishing bait. 
But you, you are much more. You are created in the likeness of the almighty God, he calls you child, he calls you friend, he calls you His. We are more than a worm will ever be. 
 Seek ye first the Kingdom of God 
How is your altar

 4 How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman? 
 Every since the beginning of the world and mankind, many people have allowed their ego and their attitudes in everything they do seem to be greater than they really are. Some may think they are Gods, but really have no power. Even when Lucifer began to have the same problem in heaven, thinking he was equal to the almighty God, and look where it got him. He was cast out of heaven and a third of the angels were cast out with him. 
 Mark 12:29 states- 
And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord: 
 We have to remember this one simple rule in everything we do: 
“We are the creation and He is the creator, never has the creation been greater than the creator!”

MAKE PEACE 
 2 Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places. 
 Understanding the atmosphere of The Kingdom of GOD is imperative to the advancement of our lives in HIS Kingdom. The NLT reveals a greater understanding of what Bildad is speaking to job. 
 2 “God is powerful and dreadful. He enforces peace in heaven. NLT 
 GOD enforces PEACE in Heaven. Consider now the value and importance of PEACE. It is the mandated atmosphere in Heaven. GOD is power and dreadful; meaning that HE has authority in all situations. GOD is looking to establish HIS Kingdom through HIS Church and that is me. 
 I must walk in HIS PEACE to establish HIS Kingdom in my life and in my surroundings. 
 I speak today the GOD of PEACE may grant you the PEACE of GOD and that we may walk in HIS authority.

 In a few words he shows the infinite distance there is between God and man, teaching us to think highly and honorably of God, and to understand our role in the Kingdom.

 It all belongs to God! He’s the only one that can provide the peace. We can all dream of peace but God is the one that can truly give you that peace. That joy and peace that just takes your breathe away. When all chaos is at hand, the peace of God is there. There is nothing much precious than His prencense in you!! Like Bro Smith said why would you want to have God next to you when you can have Him inside of you!!

 I believe this scripture is telling us how HOLY and RIGHTEOUS are GOD is… that even the stars in the sky obey him, so it is not wise to be righteous in your own eyes because the fear of The Lord is the beginning of ALL WISDOM! Only he knows what's in our hearts, some sins we may not know that we commit, God knows ALL! So it is best for us to Humble Ourselves to the lord, and to know how powerful he is, no one can bring judgement upon him or question his ways, but he can question and bring judgement upon us and our ways, and thoughts. It is best for Us to make peace with the path God has chosen for our lives, and through humility, peace, and gratitude, God will make our wrong's right and our hearts pure in his timing. Because the one who began a good work in us, will finish what he started until the day of CHRIST return.

 Job 25:4, "How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?" 
 Justified - Strong's #1344 dikaioo (pronounced dik-ah-yo'-o) 
from 1342; to render (i.e. show or regard) just or innocent: -- free; justify (-ier), be righteous. 
 Romans 5:8-9, "8) But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. 9) Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him." 
1 Cor. 6:11, "And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. 
Rev. 1:5b, "… Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood." 
 We can only be Justified and be made clean by the Blood of JESUS CHRIST!!

 I Love To Worship The Lord 
 Job 25:6 (Man a maggot?) 
For some, it's a theological teeter-totter. If God is to be exalted, man must be degraded. But as Job saw, this is a terrible wrong. Yet only in Christ do we realize how wrong Bildad was. Christ chose to become a real human being, "made a little lower than the angels," but raised again to bring "many sons of glory" (Heb. 2:9-10). 
God's love for us proves man is no maggot. Love marks us out as beings of infinite worth.

 EDITH ROMAN says:   April 16, 2019 at 11:19 am  
 
 Bildad’s final argument was based upon a misunderstanding of Job’s previous words. He seemed to think that Job wanted to convince God that He was wrong, and therefore Bildad wanted to emphasize the proper relation between the glory of God and the humility of man. “Without argument, Bildad made it perfectly clear that, in his mind, the guilt of Job was established 
We may observe the irony that being maggots themselves has not in the least discouraged Bildad and his colleagues from presuming to pass judgment on their fellow maggot Job. But who are mere maggots to exercise judgment?” 
Unlike the apostle Paul who developed the doctrine of total depravity in Romans 1-3 to prepare the way for grace, we know from the rest of Bildad’s remarks that he left no room for mercy or forgiveness.

 God is more glorious than the moon; he shines brighter than the stars. In comparison, people are maggots; we mortals are mere worms.” 
Job 25:5‭-‬6 NLT 
This version brings out the point that we simply cannot compare to to the greatness and goodness of God. Even David the psalmist said this of himself but was also prophesying of Jesus on the cross: But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people. All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.

 2 Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places. 
 Bildad makes a valid point that God is Almighty. He asks Job a series of questions that reveal how we are unworthy to question God. Dominion and fear exhibit the power of God. The fear and reverence of God is the beginning of wisdom. Dominion is something God possesses but allows us to have to overcome the enemy. Understanding who God is and developing that relationship bond will give peace to our souls.

 God is powerful and dreadful. He enforces peace in the heavens.”(Job‬ ‭25:2‬ ‭NLT‬‬) 
 God is all-powerful and in dreadful situations he is the enforcer or peace. When life becomes overwhelming all we have to do is look to God. Fearing God and giving him reverence is the start to find peace. “Fear of the Lord is the foundation of true wisdom. All who obey his commandments will grow in wisdom.

 If even the moon does not shine, And the stars are not pure in His sight, How much less man, who is a maggot, And a son of man, who is a worm?” 
Job 25:5‭-‬6 NKJV 
 Can you imagine how pure and Holy he is? His blood washed us clean. And even the moon and stars are not bright enough. He is 3 times holy as the Angles sing to Him. We are to be separate and strive for perfection.

 Our God is great God and holds all power in his hands. The enemy will try to deceive you and make you think God is like any other man. Our God is far above the heavens and he is worthy to be praised.

 4 How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman? 
 Back then, people didn’t have the blood of Jesus like we do. Thank you Jesus for your love! Now, all we have to do is repent, keep the word of God in our hearts, and fulfill His will in our lives. We stay clean before God when we repent daily and whole heartedly follow His commandments.

 Sometimes we need a friend like Bulgar, a man of few but positive words. Sometimes you have those friends that are always complaining and give you way too much of their opinion. (You know who you are!) 
2 Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places. 
3 Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise? 
Although dominion and fear are with him, he can make peace. Bilhad is expressing the greatness of God. Is there anything greater than Him? Is there anything His light doesn’t show through? What can we learn from this? Pick up on the positivity, or the emotional support for a friend, or the thought that you don’t have to overtalk sometimes. Sometimes fewer words are better.

 The answer is in the blood. 
 4 How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman? 
 I have heard it said that you cannot get good to get God, you have to get God to get good. In our natural state we do not deserve or have the right to be with God. But by the grace and the blood of Jesus Christ it is possible that we be with him. The justification doesn’t come through anything we have done, it comes by the blood. I appreciate a church that isn’t afraid to offend someone by preaching on the blood because without it there is no hope for humanity. It’s all in the blood.

 5 Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight. 
 6 How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is a worm? 
 Very interesting question. Of course he didn’t take into account that he was actually innocent. 
 Sin doesn’t bring bad times to you, life happens everyone. We just have to keep believing that God is in control.

 4 How can a mortal be innocent before God? Can anyone born of a woman be pure? 
 True statement, no one is pure. We are born into sin, and we must seek salvation. Jesus is the only path to salvation. 
 John 14:6 Jesus told him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except through me.
