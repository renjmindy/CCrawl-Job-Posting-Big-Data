 Smart contracts are not secure enough for finance, law, or systems engineering. 
 Role overview 
 Role overview 
 Smart contracts are security-critical, performance-sensitive, and bug-prone.  Metastate  is working on a dependently-typed smart contract language,  Juvix , which utilises recent advancements in type theory to allow developers to write code in a high-level functional language, compile it to gas-efficient output VM instructions, and formally verify the safety of their contracts prior to deployment & execution. 
 PLT at Metastate focuses on applying the latest research in type theory and programming language design to concrete problems in the distributed ledger space. We are looking for a type theorist and formal verification engineer to work on various parts of the Juvix stack, all the way from formalisation of an operational semantics for the language in Agda to writing formally verified smart contracts in the Juvix language itself. 
 This role offers the chance to work closely with a small team on compelling cross-disciplinary problems in computer science, PLT, cryptography, and economics, and enjoy a high degree of independence in working conditions and prioritisation. 
 Responsibilities 
 
 Produce formal specifications and implementation plans for new language features in collaboration with team members (and optionally submit to academic venues) 
 Evaluate correctness, suitability, and ease-of-implementation of published type theory and PLT research for the Juvix architecture & project aims 
 Implement both in-house and published research in Haskell in the Juvix codebase in collaboration with team members 
 Conduct code reviews and help maintain a high standard of correctness and quality 
 Write production-ready formally verified smart contracts in the Juvix language itself for various purposes 
 Comprehensively document both design and implementation choices in the codebase, and assist in writing user-facing documentation for the Juvix language 
 
 Example subprojects & features 
 
 Michelson backend - paper currently in publication process,  code 
 Extensible-data -  paper  (prior research),  code 
 First-class usages -  discussion ,  partial formalisation 
 Algebraic effects for proof construction -  paper ,  code 
 
 Qualifications 
 
 Prior experience in functional programming in Haskell, Idris, Agda, or Coq 
 Prior experience in formal verification or formalisation of a language 
 Self-motivated & self-organised 
 Interested in open-source technology and research applied to DLT 
 
 Bonus Qualifications 
 
 Prior academic work in type theory, PLT, or compiler design 
 Prior academic work in cryptography, economics, or game theory 
 
 Misc . 
 Competitive compensation in a negotiable mix of salary and equity. 
 Remote or local (ZÃ¼rich/Zug, Berlin). When remote, preferred if mostly located within (+/- 7 hours) Central European time zones. Ideally someone who enjoys nature and hiking.

 Metastate is a research and engineering team focused on implementing cutting-edge research from numerous disciplines (distributed systems, PLT, zero-knowledge cryptography) and deploying them to solve hard problems in the blockchain space, such as scalability, secure smart contract languages, secure randomness or privacy. Metastate is a remote-first team, currently composed of 15 cross-disciplinary researchers and engineers located around the world. Our work culture is characterized by open-allocation, where team members have a high degree of freedom and autonomy in choosing when to work, what to work on, and whom to work with. Metastate was founded in early 2019 by @adrian_brink, @awasunyin and @cwgoes, with extensive experience in the blockchain space and who previously co-founded Cryptium Labs, a security-oriented proof-of-stake validator from the Swiss Alps.
