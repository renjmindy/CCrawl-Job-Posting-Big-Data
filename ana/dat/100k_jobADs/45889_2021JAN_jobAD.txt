 How To Job Hunt During COVID-19 
 April 21, 2020 
 For many people, the world is at a standstill right now. 
 But those who need a job right now, it feels like a scramble to get one of the last few pieces of the pie. 
 You may be in an urgent situation and in a hurry to line up a job so it’s important to be thoughtful about your job hunt and make absolutely sure you’re putting your best foot forward. 
 Before Applying: Slow Down & Get Your Application Just Right 
 Many people are so eager to get a job right now that they’re making simple mistakes and hurting their own chances of getting a job. 
 Make sure you’ve filled out all sections of the application. Be clear with your answers and show the company how you’re a strong candidate. 
 Applications can be time consuming but don’t fall into the trap of not double checking all of your answers. 
 When you go back and read it, you’ll almost always find a mistake to fix. Avoiding the little mistakes will make you stand out from other applicants. 
 During the Hiring Process: Prepare for Virtual Interviews 
 Have you ever done a virtual interview before? Neither have most employees. 
 Until now. 
 This is the new standard during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 What does it mean for you? 
 The exact same thing it means for normal in-person interviews. 
 Practice your answers, look your best, and show interest in your employer. 
 After The Interview: Followup Like Your Job Depends On It 
 Following up after the interview is the #1 way to show a recruiter that you’re serious about the company. 
 Make a phone call a week later and ask where they’re at in the hiring process and thank them again for taking the time to interview you. 
 Most people won’t follow up after the interview but it shows that you’re genuinely interested and can improve your chances of getting hired.
