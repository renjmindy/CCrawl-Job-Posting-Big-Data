 Linking up with Amanda over on  Running with Spoons  for a Thinking Out Loud again ðŸ™‚ It's been a very, very nice week ðŸ™‚  Amanda's Blog 
 
 I had a really important job interview this past Monday morning. So, naturally, after my interview I _ OF   COURSE  _carried on my tradition of an after interview Coke Zero and a selfie. I was really nervous, but it turned out that I think it's going to end up being a new adventure ðŸ™‚ 
 
   
   
 2. I can _ finally  _sing the Taylor Swift 22 song!!! Yay!! "Everything will be alright, if we just keep dancing like we're 22!!!!" I'm pretty pumped. 
 3. Apparently, I no longer live in Texas. I live in Seattle or some sort of rain forest or permanent tropical storm. I know, I know, I'm a bad Texan for wishing away the rain, but it's the middle of May, it's yet to be actually sunny and it's a whopping 58 degrees. 
 4. My little brother is now in NHS. He's so cute, he wanted to take a picture with me yesterday ðŸ™‚ He's getting too old!!! 
 5. Lastly, birthday stuff!!!! Part of Marty's present was this mug. It cracks me up and is pretty true. He's adorable. 
 My mom got me these super adorable Raggedy Ann salt and pepper shakers and a watch! I've learned through subbing that as a teacher, wearing a watch is super useful because you don't always have a pocket to check your phone. 
   
   
 Have a wonderful weekend!!!
