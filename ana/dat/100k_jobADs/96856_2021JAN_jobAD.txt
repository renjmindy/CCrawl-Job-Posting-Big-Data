 About Us 
 (n.): late 13c. From Old French ”action of create.” creā-ture Studios is an independent videogame studio in Montreal area dedicated in bringing original IP’s to niche markets. 
 Here at creā-ture Studios, located in the surroundings of Montreal Canada, we try to do things differently. Not because we HAVE to, simply because making games doesn’t seem to be what it used to. Formed by guys who got sucked in the AAA industry for probably too long… We strive at getting back to what videogames are to us. More than a product, a creā-tion, the achievement of an art form envisioned into something fun and interactive! Our goal is to bring high quality, detail oriented, entertaining, creative and original games to niche markets and to serve them the best we can with an inspiring mindset: creating games that will meet the needs, quality standard and requirements of the people who will play them. At the end of the day, it needs to be legit and fun.
