  6 Signs It’s Time To Leave A Stable Sales Job  
 Work It Daily 
 November 12, 2013 
 Just because you may not feel the pressure of layoffs doesn’t mean you can rest on your laurels in your career. Maybe that’s not the situation you’re in. Perhaps, you have a job that makes you unhappy. No matter your scenario, there are plenty of reasons to leave a stable job. Every job is temporary these days. Employers are still complaining about the lack of qualified applicants for their openings, which means there are ample opportunities for smart job seekers to improve their conditions, no matter how good or bad they may be. These signs (and similar points) have simple solutions: with a little homework, you could find the perfect company for your career development. 
 
 
 Signs It's Time To Leave A Stable Sales Job 
 Here are some signs that it's time to leave your stable job: 
 1. There’s no more room for employee growth, a raise or a promotion. 
 
 Working smart (not just working hard) hasn’t given you a better reputation at work. 
 You want a career, not just a job. 
 When you negotiate or meet with your boss, it’s more like speaking to a wall than to having a worthwhile discussion. 
 
 Solution:  Find a company that has no caps on earnings, has many employees with high titles and/or responsibilities, and supports a learning environment where experimentation and mistakes are part of the process. “The ability to earn more money and responsibilities will always keep you busy,” Jordan Silver, a Senior Sales Representative at  Fusion Worldwide  says. “You can turn a job into a career that way.” If those guidelines are in place, it will be a good spot for you to enhance your career without ever worrying about a dead end. 
 2. You want a new challenge. 
 
 You’re going through the motions, with every day feeling even more monotonous than the last. 
 You feel your talents would work better in another role or another industry. 
 You want to meet new people. 
 
 Solution:  Try a place where your interests align with the business’, but maybe in a way you wouldn’t expect. (For example, if you’re a people person and you like technology, you could try sales in the tech sector. If you’re good with numbers, you could be an accountant for an art museum.) 
 3. You want more autonomy. 
 
 You are micromanaged. 
 You are taught how to do everything out of an outdated rule book. 
 You feel you aren’t given credit for your victories. 
 
 Solution:  Join a company that gives its employees freedom throughout the business cycle as long as you accomplish your goals. “When you have autonomy, your chances for growth are huge,” Luke LeSaffre, a Fusion Worldwide Senior Sales Representative says. “Without someone breathing down your neck, you can focus on the things you do best to provide top-notch quality for your clients.” If drafting a progress report is necessary, you could explain how your tactics helped beat your projections more than another process may have. By showing what you have done, you can pinpoint exactly how you helped the business (and which areas you need to improve in the future). 
 4. You want more support. 
 
 No one at your company knows how to help you. 
 No one is willing to lend you a hand. 
 Your co-workers don’t understand how much work you have to do when you help them. 
 
 Solution:  Go to a business with people that are open to mentoring new employees or anyone willing to pick their brains. If there is cross-pollination between departments, there’s a good chance some other people may be able to help if your boss or co-workers aren’t around. 
 5. You don’t enjoy your current job. 
 
 You don’t like your boss. 
 You don’t like your coworkers. 
 You don’t like office politics or unnecessary drama. 
 
 Solution:  Start fresh with a collection of individuals that are different from whom you’re used to working with. Research the culture of a few companies by learning about their employees’ interests and work history. When we spoke to Fusion Worldwide employees about their company’s culture, they used an abundance of traits any company would be proud to have, like ambition, cooperation and intelligence. With a careful selection on your part, your next employer could have the right mix of skills for you to thrive. Try to contact employees directly to ask them about the attitude in the office. If people are happy with their jobs, they probably aren’t causing problems. 
 6. You don’t like the direction the company is headed in. 
 
 The leaders of the company are unwilling to accept responsibility for big-picture issues. 
 Co-workers and bosses of your deflect blame and do the bare minimum to get by. 
 Everyone talks a big game, but no one follows through with their ideas or works with others to help their ideas come to fruition. 
 
 Solution:  Connect with a business that shares the same ethics you do. Make sure they conduct themselves in the office and in the real world similar to how you do. If they’re a transparent company, it will give you the chance to discover the essentials of business in your industry and help accomplish more things on your to-do list by understanding where you fit in. Isn’t that what everyone wants in the workplace? And, if you’d like to learn more about Fusion Worldwide and its job openings, check them out  HERE>>
