 Oh –ï–∫–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–Ω–∞! I agree with your choice, this artist commanded so well the spots with watercolors and with an spontaneous way. In this work specially with the white aereas. Thanks for your comment. Cheers ‚ù§

 All great, but I go with the Beardsley this time:-) Clear and simple, but immediately recognisable, the era, the place and the artist.

 Dear Katie, your visits are a real pride for this blog because the yours is full of deep and nice feelings. If you have patience it will grow but the success is not to have a lot of followers than to get a fine feedback with them. Good luck üçÄüê∏üíö

 Thank you, that means a lot to me! That's very true, I often get asked "How do you get lots of followers?", but that's never my goal ever since I started blogging. I just write what is on my mind, and what feels true to myself. It's an enjoyable hobby to have! x

 No hurries Katie, loyalty to oneself is the important thing, this is not an industrial issue. We're interested about feelings and well being. But in the future maybe what you think that is only a hobby can become in something more. Have a nice day, honey. xo.
