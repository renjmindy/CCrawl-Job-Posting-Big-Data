  How To Stand Out At A New Job (And Fit In Too)  
 Andria Corso

 November 05, 2020 
 Congratulations! After months of job hunting, you finally got hired for the job you wanted! 
 Getting a new job is exciting. However, after the dust settles from celebrating this accomplishment, you have some work to do. 
 
 Being a new employee can be tough sometimes. But if you're ready to embrace the challenge, you can make a smooth career change. 
 Here are a few tips to make sure you start your new job on the right foot. 
 Understand The Company Culture 
 First, take time to get to know the culture of your new company. The best way to do this is to schedule meetings with your team—both those who will be working for you and with you. 
 Ask them questions about their work routine and how they get things accomplished. It's also a good idea to get a sense of how easy or difficult it is to implement new ideas and initiatives. This will give you a good feel for how adaptable (or how slow) the company culture is to change. 
 You should also take note of your own workplace personality and how it fits into the company culture. If you're in need of a good personality test, try Work It Daily's FREE  Workplace Personas Quiz. 
 Identify The Key Stakeholders 
 Next, find out who the key stakeholders are for your specific role and meet with them. For example, if you are entering a company as a finance manager, find out who the key business leaders are that you will be supporting in your position. 
 Take time to build relationships with them and understand their primary financial concerns. You should also take time to get to know their work routines, and the best times and ways to communicate with them. While communication is important, it's also important to respect each others' schedules. 
 Find A Work Buddy

 Another tip to help you get off on the right foot at the new job is to get a buddy. This should be a  peer who works  on the same team as you or in the same department as you. 
 This person will help you figure out who's who and give you some inside information on some of those office politics . It's important to understand the team dynamic so you don't step on anyone's toes or disrupt the culture when you first get there. 
 Your buddy is also there for you to ask questions such as, "How do I order office supplies?" or, "How do I set up my voice mailbox?" 
 Show Your Commitment To The Job 
 Next, have a career  conversation with your boss .  This lets him or her know you're serious about and committed to growing your career.  When you first start working at your new company, you may not know enough (yet) to speak specifically about the career paths available there. However, take time to have a conversation with your manager about your aspirations. 
 Share information about your desires to advance and grow as well as specific information about your strengths and the areas you'd like to develop. Ask your manager for input on your career plan and then use it as a living, active document. 
 Make A 30-60-90 Day Plan 
 Finally, it always helps to have a  30-60-90 day plan  as you start a new job. Document the details of what you want to accomplish in your first three months. (For example, the specific people you want to meet with, the tasks you want to accomplish, etc.) It also helps to share this plan with your manager so you can get some input. 
 There may be some things missing that your manager views as being critical to accomplish in the first 90 days.  Remember to be flexible with your plan as things may change and objectives you set for the first three months may shift as you get more involved and begin to learn more about your new job.  You want to be seen as committed to meeting the objectives you set, yet flexible enough to deal with changes. 
 By implementing these few simple items, you can get off to a great start at your new job and quickly begin to be viewed as a value-added asset at your new company.
