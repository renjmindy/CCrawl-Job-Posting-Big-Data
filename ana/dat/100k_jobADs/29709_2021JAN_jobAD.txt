 Who we are: 
 At Bricklane, we want to set a new standard for property investment - helping people invest from as little as £100, all the way up to £100 million+. 
 Using a data-driven approach, we've created a simple, hassle-free way for people to invest in Britain's favourite asset class from the comfort of their own home. Backed by the likes of Zoopla and LocalGlobe, we've assembled a smart, collaborative team from the worlds of tech, property and finance. 
 We want to make renting better for everyone: 
 At present, the UK rental market is not fit for purpose and requires institutional capital to bring it into the 21st century. 
 Institutions have long favoured UK residential property as an investment and have hundreds of millions of pounds ready to invest in the sector. However, given how fragmented the market is, they typically struggle to invest meaningfully. 
 To address this, we have built an acquisitions machine to assemble huge property portfolios through individual transactions - giving institutions access to the entire UK residential market at scale. 
 Professionalising the rental market will be transformative for millions of renters; giving people the homes they deserve, improving the length & security of tenancy and providing a level of service that individual buy-to-let investors simply cannot. 
 Why this role is vital: 
 As a company we live and die on our ability to efficiently buy huge volumes of property. Our Acquisitions team will be critical to this, owning management of our third-party conveyancers and making the final decisions on which purchases to complete and which to walk away from. 
 The Property Transaction Manager will be responsible for maximising speed and number of completions while minimising cost and risk. Your ability to drive both of these priorities forward will be fundamental to deploying funds at the scale we are looking to. 
 You 're good at: 
 
 Getting into the nuts and bolts of a problem and coming up with creative solutions that scale. You have 3+ years of experience handling residential property transactions. 
 Keeping lots of plates spinning and wearing several different hats. 
 Delivering quality over quantity. 
 Collaborating with colleagues from a range of disciplines. 
 Taking ownership of the projects you're working on. 
 Working on meaningful challenges and making a difference. 
 Playing a central role in a rapidly growing business. 
 
 Working with us means: 
 
 Playing a central role in a rapidly growing business. 
 Being empowered -- you'll never be afraid to share your opinion. 
 Working in a lean, entrepreneurial environment but with all the support you need. 
 
 The cherry on top: 
 
 Flexibility:   we're open-minded about remote working so you're empowered to do your job. 
 Personal development:   we'll support you with training opportunities to help you grow. 
 Holiday:   26 days annual leave (plus bank holidays) for your well-earned breaks. 
 Socials:   we like to get together as a team with regular activities and events. 
 Health:   we offer Vitality healthcare to support your health and wellbeing, with discounts for gym membership and cinema tickets. 
 Pension:   you'll be covered for later life with our pension plan.
