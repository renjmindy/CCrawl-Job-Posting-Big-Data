 Delivering Honesty With Kindness

 One of the kindest things I do every now and then is tell someone I've just met that they don't have a realistic shot at getting an interview for the job they want to apply to. 
 On the surface, that would appear to go against one of my key goals which is establishing and nurturing a partnership between myself as an Employment Counsellor and them as a job seeker. I mean, at a first meeting, you'd think I'd be going out of my way to have them see me as a nice fellow who leaves them feeling inspired and full of confidence. That would be nice, and for a lot of people I meet for the first time, this is exactly how they perceive me when they walk away. 
 Here's the thing though; I'd rather a jobseeker come to see me as authentic, helpful and sincere in my desire to see them ultimately succeed. That ultimate success means taking the time to find the right job, the right employer, the right match for their skills, experience, interests and their needs. And in fairness to the employers I am working with to find talent, it also means sending them job applicants who are qualified; of the right character fit with authentic skills and experience. 
 Recently I was introduced to a person looking to make a career shift from the job they have now to another. On the upside, I give credit to this job seeker for several things: 1) seeking out the professional services of an employment agency 2) realizing the need for a better resume and 3) having the resiliency and courage to move from a position they are performing at well to a new position where there will be a steep learning curve. 
 However, on the downside, the person not only lacks a specific software knowledge the employer has described as a strong asset, they lack required experience in basic computer skills. Further, they have no experience in the environment which the employer has stated is expected. 
 It was evident to me within 5 minutes of meeting them that there was a gulf between the employers stated needs and this applicants experience and skills. It wasn't going to be fair to send them off with a shiny new resume, full of false confidence and have them compete against applicants with years of experience and education to match. In the field they were considering, it is well-known that the labour market is flooded with highly-qualified candidates. 
 What I did do was gently but nonetheless clearly, tell them that without the mandatory skills required, they didn't have a shot at the position. Had I stopped talking and left things there, it wouldn't have been a good conclusion. They walked in for help after all, and I was determined to provide it; albeit different from what they had expected. 
 Well, we constructed a resume together that promoted the transferable skills they have, focused on their character and personal qualities that would be a desirable fit, and printed it off. The wording on the resume had them sitting up straighter, feeling really good at how they came across on paper, promoting skills and qualities they hadn't verbalized but yet I had discerned and labeled from listening to them describe their current and past work. 
 But what really has them feeling better is a promise I made to them which they hadn't expected when they came in the door. While I provided a resume for them to take to the job fair they were heading out to, I told them that I or one of my colleagues would like to work with them to better explore their skills and abilities and find a position for which they would compete as a strong candidate. 
 This offer of unexpected help to better get to know them and find the right fit, more than anything else, had this job seeker leave expressing gratitude for the honesty and willingness to help. They remarked as they left that they didn't expect to get the job anymore and if they did somehow it would be a nice surprise. But this person wasn't disappointed and thanked me for sharing the truth. 
 Employment Counsellors are good at what we do. We read people and do our best to meet people where they are in life and support them on their career journey with the goal of setting them up for success. We recognize that you as the job seeker are the expert of you; you know yourself better than we ever will. The key is to work in true partnership together; you knowing you and we knowing how to draw out your accomplishments, rich experiences, achievements and then marketing these in language that not only appeals to employers, it just makes you feel empowered. 
 It's a risk to tell a person you've just met that they aren't in the running for a job when you know the needs of an employer and what an applicant lacks. However, the risk/reward almost always pays off with a relationship they can trust in; knowing they've partnered with an Employment Counsellor who has their best interests in mind. The goal therefore is to deliver honesty with kindness out of a deep set respect for the person, rather than only telling someone what you believe they wish to hear.

 Don't Apply For Jobs In December 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  interviewing ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  philosophy ,  problem solving ,  relationship building ,  resume 
 There are many job seekers who see a lot of logic in not bothering to apply for work in the month of December. They've determined that companies are soon shutting down for the holidays and the people responsible for receiving all those resumes and selecting candidates to hire are really looking at taking time off. 
 If you're one of the job seekers who holds this belief; that it's pointless to job search in December, you're making a huge mistake. But please! By all means yes, continue to avoid applying for work this month! You're making it so much easier for the people I'm partnering with in their job search. In fact, let me extend a sincere thank you for reducing the size of the competition. 
 As you know, applying for work is a very competitive endeavour. There are more people applying for various positions than ever. Apparently, from the information I've gathered from employers, for every job advertised, there are approximately 150 - 175 applications received. The fact that you're doing your part to reduce that number and increase the odds of those I'm supporting to land interviews and get hired is most appreciated! 
 Next week I'm holding a two week job search group; that's December 9th - 20th on the calendar. Yikes! What tough time of year to job search right? There's the Christmas traffic, the Christmas hustle and bustle, the kids Christmas concerts in school, people to buy or make Christmas presents for, the house or apartment to decorate for Christmas, the shopping for the Christmas ham or turkey. Why you're likely exhausted just thinking about it. Best you put your feet up and recline in the lazy boy. Add a job search to all that? No, of course not; you best take it easy. 
 Still, my little group and I will be at work, researching opportunities, writing cover letters and resumes, practicing our interview skills, and above all else, applying for jobs. While there's every possibility that we might land a hire or two in these two weeks, it's probable that the interviewing and hiring won't actually take place until the new year. That's absolutely fine with us; we'll be ready. 
 Look, any job seeker will tell you how difficult it is to land work and that any advantage they can see they'll seize. So, when the competition starts to falter for lack of enthusiasm, that's the very time to ramp up the effort. The same goes for rainy days, extreme cold or heat periods, and Mondays. You see the same folks who have stopped job searching in December are likely the kind who wake up, see the clouds pouring down on them and choose to roll over and go back to sleep. Again, thank you if that's you! 
 Job searching IS work. It takes sustained energy and focus to successfully job search. You've got to have a willingness to carry on in the face of what appears to be indifference or rejection by some employer's. All that work researching companies, targeting resumes, writing cover letters, completing online profiles and repeating this process again and again. It can certainly get discouraging. I think this is why the people who have accepted my invitation to join my group are so looking forward to the experience. You see, they'll partner up with me; someone they believe will motivate them when they feel the urge to slow down. They'll also be supported by their fellow job seekers, and enthusiasm my reader is contagious! 
 If it's true that attitude determines your altitude, we're aiming high. We aren't hoping to get interviews and jobs; we're EXPECTING to get interviews and jobs! You see, the belief I plan to share and instil is the same belief I've always held; if we create strong resumes, quality resumes and improve upon our interview skills, the chances of success rise - substantially. If we then work to improve on our quantity of quality applications, our chances of success rise substantially again. Quality first, followed by quantity. 
 But you can do your part to help us along. If you're a job seeker yourself, take the month off; nobody is hiring anyway right? If you're an Employment Coach or Counsellor, suggest your clients ease back on the job search and conserve their energy for the new year; nobody is hiring anyway right? 
 Of course this advice is entirely tongue in cheek. If nobody is hiring, why then are there jobs being advertised? Do you think companies advertise just to falsely get people's hopes up? That they have too much time on their hands and want to conduct interviews for jobs that don't exist just to meet people? No of course not! They are advertising jobs because they have a need for qualified and enthusiastic employees. 
 Remember this basic truth; if they advertise a job, THEY have a need. Sure you need a job, but they need an employee. It's not all desperation on your part and no stress at their end. They have to find someone and it can't be just anybody. They are looking at hiring the right someone, and this is where your research comes in. Present yourself as the right candidate. 
 Of course, if you were looking for a sign that you shouldn't bother looking for work until 2020, take this blog as your sign. Pack it in, put on, "White Christmas" and cover yourself up with that warm throw.

 Understanding Teamwork 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  interviewing ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  networking ,  relationship building ,  resume ,  team building ,  trust 
 "Must be a team player." 
 "Must be able to work independently and in teams." 
 Some version of the above appears consistently in job posts these days. So much so in fact, that I'm getting kind of numb to reading over and over again in the resumes I start with a line that reads, "Can work independently or in teams." I shudder just writing it there myself. Oh my goodness please don't put this on your own resume and look exactly like 95% of all the other applicants you're up against. B O R I N G ! 
 Like any job requirement listed by an employer, it is imperative that you understand what the employer is asking for and why the position requires that particular skill set. When you understand the, 'why', you'll find you suddenly have a much better grasp of their need, and so, when you include that skill or ability on your resume, you'll do a much better job of presenting it, rather than just looking like you used copy and paste to get it on your page. How unimaginative! 
 I mean just think of the people on the receiving end, going over all those resumes they received. Imagine yourself in their shoes, and objectively ask yourself whether your own resume would stand out when yours, like most of them have the exact same words in that one line; "Work well independently or in teams". 
 So what does it MEAN to work a team? Depending on the job, it could mean you listen to others, cooperate, share ideas, show flexibility, cover when co-workers are off, pitch in, collaborate, cooperate, support, encourage, engage, initiate, share resources, accommodate, etc. For a job involving teamwork you have to have excellent communication skills and sound interpersonal skills. Your team might be made up of people at your same level of seniority, but your team could also include interns, junior partners, senior management, front-line workers, administrative support staff. The folks on your team will not necessarily work in the same physical location if you think about it too. Could be they work in another department in the same building, on another floor, or across the city, in another province or state, or even on another continent. 
 Depending on the above, your teamwork might happen when you work face-to-face, over the phone, teleconferencing, face-timing over the internet, via email or fax, maybe even working collaboratively in a team with people you'll only ever communicate with using a keyboard. Of course, for many of you reading this, your team will be comprised of your closest co-workers; the ones you physically engage with every day. 
 So first off, understand what the team looks like in the job you're applying for. And there's something not everyone thinks of when they do envision the type of team they'll work with. Every team has a set of values, and it's these values that they demonstrate as they go about their work. If you don't know what the values are a team holds in high regard, it's going to be hit and miss when you're in an interview and trying to demonstrate what a great fit you are. If on the other hand you've done some advance work finding out what the team you'll potential join holds dear, you can align yourself with that same set of values and you'll then talk and act in such a way that it makes it easier for the employer to see you fitting in. 
 On the team I'm on for example, flexibility, creativity, and collaboration are values we hold. Anyone joining our team might show up at work and suddenly find that due to the absence of a co-worker on the team, their assigned role for the day is changing. That means in turn you'd have to be or learn quickly to be, flexible, adaptable to change. All the workshops we do involve working either alone or with a co-facilitator. Hence, collaboration and accepting the ideas of others is a job requirement. Positive interpersonal skills are essential because you're not always in agreement with how a day will pan out, and when you're making adjustments on the fly before an audience, they will be watching to see how you both interact with each other, consult and amend everything from switching the order of your lessons, shortening or lengthening a topic, adjusting break or lunch periods etc. And when the day is done and you're tidying up, you need to work together to make adjustments, evaluate how things are progressing and turn to preparing for the next day. 
 Armed with all of that, it feels so inadequate to just say on my own resume, "Work well in teams." How badly I would be marketing my abilities! 
 I might however say, 
 
 Collaborate and work productively in team environments where flexibility, creativity, leadership and strong interpersonal skills are highly valued 
 
 Now I'm packing a lot more into the teamwork angle. I've included 4 traits that fit with what I've read or learned the employer values. Now imagine my every bullet was enhanced and strengthened in a similar way. Or rather, imagine YOUR resume was strengthened in a similar way. 
 What's important to is to prove through your accomplishments which you document on the resume that you've actually had these collaborative team experiences. Just making an idle claim that you work well in teams isn't good enough; it might not be true.

 Not Getting Many Interviews? 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  interviewing ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  mental health ,  networking ,  older workers ,  philosophy ,  relationship building ,  resume ,  trust 
 Wouldn't it be nice if you were granted an interview each and every time you applied for a job? Obviously employer's can't grant every single applicant an interview; there just isn't the time for them to interview everyone that sends them a resume. In only deciding to interview a small number of those who actually apply, it's highly probable they fail to interview some excellent candidates. 
 On your side of table, that's of little comfort if you're among those passed over and not granted an interview. In fact, it's hard to know whether the employer thought you were good enough to interview but there were just too many to meet with, or you didn't measure up at all to what they were looking for. 
 Given the effort you go to in the entire application process, it would seem only fair that the company you apply to would at the very least acknowledge your application. I mean, even an automatic reply just verifying they received your application is exciting to someone just learning how to apply to online jobs. To someone more experienced, it means little; they're after a human response, and to other applicants, only an interview will do as their measure of success. And then there are those who only consider actually being offered the job as being worth their time and effort. 
 So for the applicant, I guess it really comes down to the things you can control and leaving what you can't aside. You can't for example limit the number of people who are competing with you for the job, nor can you control the preferences and biases of those who might interview. The salary offered, the actual job responsibilities and the location of the job are other things you typically can't control; nor the format preferred by the company for the interview itself; a panel, one-to-one, second or third interviews etc. Like I said, don't fret about that over which you have no control. 
 What you can control however is the quality and quantity of job applications you submit. I can personally recall a time in the past when I got an interview each and every time I applied for a job. I suspect that had more to do with the times and the relatively low number of people applying for jobs as opposed to taking credit for the quality of my applications. I don't hear many people these days claiming to get interviews every single time they apply for a job. There's just too many other people applying for and competing for every single job out there. 
 Don't get discouraged with that picture. You're only out of the running for a job if you fail to apply at all. There's an old saying that anything worth doing is worth doing well, and that applies to job searching and putting your name forth as an applicant. Sadly, I still see people every week standing in front of a photocopier churning out 20 resumes at a time and submitting that one document to multiple jobs. This is quantity for sure, but it's definitely not quality. The only way this is likely to be successful is if that generic resume just happens to include what the employer is looking for, or they are so desperate for anyone to do the work they'll interview anyone breathing regardless of how qualified they are. 
 To be interviewed means you need the following in your resume: 
 
 skills and qualifications that match the employer's needs 
 no spelling or grammar errors 
 proof that you've got experience that matches their requirements 
 
 That doesn't sound like to much to need does it? Yet, it's surprising how many resumes fail to have all three of these things. When an employer for example says they want someone with 6 month's to a year's experience, someone with 10 years will often say exactly that; figuring that they've got so much experience, the employer will be impressed and interview them for sure. Not always is that the case. 6 month's to a year's experience is really code for, "we want you to know enough that we don't have to teach you everything, but we want you to also be green enough we can mould you and train you to do things our way." Someone with 10 years experience might come across as experienced yes, but possibly they'll bring bad habits and a narrow mind with them and be resistant to doing things the way this employer wants them done. 
 As for grammar and spelling, most employer's figure your resume is a pretty important document in your eyes, so this represents you at your best. If it's sloppy and full of mistakes, they fear you'll be even worse when you work for them on things that are important to them but less so to you. This is of critical importance if you are seeking work where you will make correspondence in the course of your work, such as working in an office, but it's important to every person no matter the job. 
 Look, the bottom line is this; you want interviews, and if you're not getting many whatsoever, you've got to increase the odds in your favour. The only way to do this is get better at applying. If you know what you're doing wrong, fix it. If you don't know however, you must get help from someone who can point out some areas for improvement.

 Job Hunting When You Have One 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  interviewing ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  mental health ,  networking ,  relationship building ,  resume ,  trust 
 Looking for a job to replace the one you have now makes a lot of sense. When you're looking at the postings out there, you aren't as desperate as you might be were you not working at all. You can afford to be selective, choosing to put off applying to jobs that don't fully interest you; jobs you might actually have applied to in your unemployed past. 
 This job you're on the hunt for has to pay you more than what you're making now, be more stimulating, more meaningful and more of a career than a job; any or all of these possibilities. It might have to be closer to home, closer to the cottage, perhaps nearer the person you're dating, have benefits or growth opportunities etc. Your next job has to in your view, be better than the one you have now. 
 And there you have it, the reason for looking for some other job; you're seeking something better than what you have at the present. Lest you think you're the only one looking for work when you have a job, let me assure you there are a great number of people who job hunt while working. 
 If you're out of work, or you've been out of work in the past, perhaps you can identify with the anxiety and desperation you've felt in past job interviews. The increased pressure to get a job and stop the financial bleeding of your resources. Maybe you remember telling people you'd do, "anything" too. Hopefully, now that you are actually working, you've dropped, "Anything" as a job you were willing and happy to do. When I hear people say that - and just yesterday I heard that from 3 people - it's a sad message to hear. I've yet to find the person who will actually do anything by the way. 
 One problem of looking for a job when you have one is your level of motivation. Most employed people don't work at getting a new job with the same vigor they'd apply if they were not working. So many skim a few job websites daily, maybe apply to the odd job every couple of weeks or more. You know, there are other things to do that seem like more of a priority. The out-of-work person is more focused, determined, desperate, hungry - take your pick of words. 
 The upside of looking for work is coming from a position of strength; as you're already employed, an employer interested in your services has to present something better than what you have now if they truly want to pry you away. But don't delude yourself into thinking that just by telling them your present circumstances they are going to open the vault and ask you to name your salary. That might be the case in movies or if you're the potential CEO of a company, but for most of us, it's just not the case. Still, there's a reason applications often ask you to state your current employment status and present salary. 
 One thing you need to address is whether to tell your current employer you're looking for another job or not. There are clear advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, you might work for an employer that doesn't want you using company time and resources to look for work, send emails, go to interviews etc. Then again, some employers encourage their workforce to grow as individuals whether that means advancing internally or sincerely wishing them the best as they move on. 
 At some point you'll need to inform your employer. Maybe when it's down to you and one other person for a job and the potential employer wants to speak with your references. That call to your current employer might not go as well as you'd like if it blindsides them completely. Then again, you might be imagining the scene when you just walk in and announce your impending departure. 
 I've found that people who are looking elsewhere for jobs - for the most part - mentally check out to some degree. As they look for a future with another firm, they stop investing themselves 100% in the job they have at present. If you listen to their words, watch them in team meetings or as they go about their day, they just perform differently. That may be only logical, but your present employer isn't paying you less as you invest less in them, so you've got a responsibility to still deliver on your responsibilities. 
 If you're the kind of person who likes to share your thoughts, you might even want to confide in a colleague at work; someone you can trust with your plan to leave. If I can give you one piece of advice on this, be respectful of that person. You might be putting them in some emotional conflict and divided loyalty. Is that fair? 
 Hopefully you work for the kind of boss who promotes personal development; who wants to see you move up and yes, sometimes move on. These Supervisors invest in the people they work with and share your enthusiasm for something new. They are the kind of people who appreciate a heads up that you're looking, and give you the time to go to interviews etc. By setting the right climate where you can share without fear, they can better plan ahead for your possible departure. 
 Good fortune with your search. How's it going?

 How Long Should I Wait After Applying? 
 decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  interviewing ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  philosophy ,  relationship building ,  resume ,  trust 
 One question I often get asked by job seekers I work with is how long should I wait to follow up with an employer after applying for a job. So today, let's look at this question from both your point of view as the applicant, and the employers point of view. 
 First however, let me ask you to honestly think about your own comfort level in general with picking up the phone and making the follow up call. Are you comfortable doing this and just want to know when, or are you uncomfortable making the call no matter when the time is right? You see, there are many applicants I've worked with who don't really want to make that call and would put it off indefinitely unless I sat right next to them and gently pushed them to make the call. Okay, so you know deep down whether you're likely to make the call in the end. Good. 
 As to when is the right time to make the call, I'm sorry to disappoint you but the answer is a very unclear, "it depends". Oh keep reading though, I'll give you more guidance than that! 
 Looking at the job ad, are there any indicators of a deadline date? When you know the closing date to apply to a job, you have to assess how close it is coming up or indeed if it's past. Knowing where you stand on the calendar with respect to this date guides you as to what to say when you make the call. If the deadline date is another two weeks in the future, you can still call to confirm they received your application and you can go further and ask if you might be able to pick up a more detailed job description, additional information on the organization or perhaps an annual report. The smart thing of course would be to inquire about the more detailed job description prior to submitting your application so you can include more relevant information on your resume that others will not. Just a hint. 
 Should the deadline have passed just recently, you should definitely make the call now. You may not have ever been someone who hires for a company, but I have and I talk with others who do. Many employers receive resumes up to the deadline date and then wait a couple of days or more. Why are they waiting when there's a position to fill you ask? While they sift through the applicants to determine possible candidates, they also heed who calls and who doesn't. Their assumption is that the go-getters, the ones who are really hungry and want the job the most are the ones who will call. Not desperate you understand, but they are viewed as determined, professional, show initiative and the employers are then also able to hear the applicant's voice, their ability to express themselves and now they have additional information which they don't on those who just sit home and hope for a call. 
 I bet you're argument however is that today many job postings clearly state no calls; that only certain applicants will be contacted. This is one frustrating thing for those who are good at following up and it's the best argument possible for those who hate picking up the phone and talking to an employer. It levels the playing field for those who are glad not to have to call. Well, guess what? Do an experiment and call some employer's anyhow. What!? Seriously? Fly in the face of the employer's wishes and call when they ask you not to? 
 Here's a strategy to try. (And after all, if your current way of going about things isn't working, continuing to go about things the way you are up to now just might continue to end in no positive results.) 
 Determine that you're going to call. When you do, don't just say, "Did I make the cut?" and then hang up. That's what the employer asked you not to do. Try this: 
 
 Hello, my name is ______ and I'm competing for the position of _____. I understand and respect your wishes not to be contacted for an interview, so I'm calling just to introduce myself so I stand out from the competition, and want to expressing how grateful I'd be for the opportunity to demonstrate my strong interest in person. If there's any additional information you'd like, I'm only too happy to deliver that to you. 
 
 So, you haven't actually called with the lame, "So, are you going to interview me?", and you acknowledge you're aware of their instructions not to bother them. Is it a gamble? Sure it is. So is applying for a job in the first place. You might like it and you might not; the whole application is a gamble. You will succeed with some employers in showing them how polite and professional you are - determined to succeed where others are not. Or you will turn off an employer who doesn't want anyone to show initiative, tenacity, determination or resolve. 
 Keep track of the jobs you apply to and which ones you follow up with a phone call and which you don't. Look for patterns and what works over what doesn't. Do more of what works. 
 When you do call, be in a quiet place, resume in front of you, pen and paper ready, know your calendar. Good luck!

 15 Resume Mistakes 
 decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  resume 
 Have you ever worked on something important, felt it was perfect, submitted it with confidence and only then discovered you made some fatal error? Too late, you frantically search for some recall feature but alas, there's none to be had! 
 Your resume could be just such a document. The only thing worse I suppose is being totally oblivious to your mistake(s) and continuing the practice of sending out flawed resumes. Yikes! Could this be why you're getting very little or no positive results? 
 Having no way to provide feedback on your personal resume without seeing it, I've listed here some common mistakes I see on resumes. Check your own resume and see how you compare. 
 
 You mistyped your email.  Just last week I came across a resume with the word, 'professional' as part of the email but it was on the resume as, 'professinal'. No one had caught it as they reviewed her resume, as the mind sees what it thinks rather than what the eyes see. 
 Bullets don 't line up.  Get out a ruler if it's a hard copy or click and hold down the left mouse button on the ruler in MS Word to draw a straight line on your resume where your bullets are. Do they line up or are they off? 
 Inconsistent use of periods.  Look at the end of each line on your resume which starts with a bullet. Do you have periods at the end of some lines and not on others? Get in the habit of not using periods; period. 
 Irregular capitalization.  Nouns should be capitalized and so make sure any job title has a capital letter at the start of each word if there is more than one as in, 'Customer Service Representative'. 
 Dates don 't line up.  Look at the dates on your resume. Are the dates all over the place or are they uniformly lined up on the extreme right where they should be? Lining these up makes it easier on the eyes; your resume is less cluttered. 
 It 's all about you.  If your resume starts off talking about what you want, stop! Employers want to know how you'll benefit them, not the other way around. How is hiring you profitable? 
 You added the dreaded, 's'.  When you add a simple, 's' to the end of a word, it can change the language from 1st to 3rd person. Suppose you communicate effectively as a skill. See how there is no, 's' at the end of the word, 'communicate'? That's you talking about you. Add an, 's' and it reads, "communicates well" and this is 3rd person; someone else talking about you. This suggests you didn't write your own resume; someone else is talking about you. The entire resume now comes across as less than authentic. 
 ' Responsible for…".  Don't start a line with, 'Responsible for…". Being responsible for something doesn't indicate whether you are or were actually good at whatever you are referencing. It only indicates you are/were responsible for it. Maybe you actually performed terribly, but hey, you WERE responsible! 
 Photo included.  Get your photo off your resume and do it now! A growing number of people in Human Resources automatically dismiss resumes with photos included because they don't want to expose themselves to claims of bias or personal attraction based on appearance. 
 " References available upon request."  It's a given that you'll provide references when asked to do so. Including this on your resume is outdated. 
 Repeating yourself.  Look at the first words that begin your bullets. If you see the same word repeated, (sometimes even on consecutive lines) alter the words. It's boring to read when you start multiple lines with the same words. 
 Your qualifications don 't match.  Job postings for the most part list desired qualifications. So pull one out that you applied to. Look at your resume and see if what they asked for was what you gave them. If yours don't mirror the ad, no wonder you didn't get an interview. 
 Spelling errors.  I get it. If spelling is an issue for you, it's hard if not impossible to know when you make a mistake. Using a spelling and grammar check is good but a second pair of eyes is also recommended; as long as those eyes belong to someone with excellent spelling and attention to detail themselves. 
 You included personal data.  Get your age, sex, marital status, religion and nationality off your resume. By the way, is your age easily guessed in your email of all things? Yikes! 
 You named your resume what?  When you send your resume, people at the other end see what you called it as they move to open it. You didn't call it, 'My 2nd best resume' did you? Someone I worked with did. Let's go with a combination of job title and company name. 
 
 Okay 15 general tips for you to read over and more importantly use to improve your own resume. Maybe cleaning up your resume can be your goal for today. Resolving a job search barrier every day is a great way to feel you're making positive moves to increase your odds of getting interviews and getting hired. 
 The biggest mistake of all continues to be mass producing a resume and handing it to many employers rather than targeting it to jobs you apply to. No matter how many times I say it, for some this comes as shocking.

 If Resumes Were Only About Key Words 
 decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  resume 
 More and more people are coming to understand that constructing a winning resume; one that gets you invited in for an interview involves ensuring the key words and phrases from a job posting are included in their résumé. 
 If that was all employer's were looking for, you'd think they'd be receiving an extremely high percentage of such resumes, giving them the luxury of having many highly qualified people to choose from. You'd also think that if it's just a case of putting these keywords in a résumé, anyone could consider themselves an expert by doing so. That's not the case though; resume writing is a craft like any other endeavour, and there are those who are better at it than others. 
 This being the case, that resume writing is a skill; what would make some people believe that they can write one as good as anyone else? Especially if writing a résumé is something they only do when out of work and looking for a job. No, there's got to be more separating those who craft resumes - and there is. 
 Your résumé you may recall from earlier posts, is your personal marketing document. It should therefore, or rather it must therefore, communicate clearly to the employer that bringing you in for a conversation will be worth their while. And by this, I mean that as their time is valuable (as too is your own), they have to perceive some benefit to be derived from meeting with you as a potential employee. Think, "How does hiring you benefit us?" and you've got it. 
 Many resumes fail to communicate this to an employer however. No, many resumes send the message, "I want to work for you so that I benefit in the following ways". This message doesn't appeal to an employer at all. Organizations aren't in the charitable business of giving people jobs just so they can grow and learn new skills. Businesses have to be profitable, their workforces efficient, and how will hiring you achieve profitability? 
 So pull out your résumé - go ahead I'll wait. You'll find this useful trust me. 
 Okay so looking at the document, have a look at your stated qualifications. I would hope that what you have in this area responds to the stated needs of the company you are applying to. If it does, that's good but that's not all you need. Does each line stop there? Is that all you included? For example, if the employer says the successful applicant must have the ability to work well in teams, it takes more than just saying, "Team player". Maybe you said, "Work well with others" or "Work well in team settings". Ho-hum, boring and pretty standard for a lot of resumes. If this is on your résumé, you don't really think you're making the best impression you could do you? Unfortunately, the answer for many is that yes, that is exactly what they believe. 
 
 "Work cooperatively with co-workers; self-invested in working towards common organizational goals, achieving efficiencies and maximizing profitability". 
 
 The above has a lot packed in to that single bullet. First it communicates how you work with others; in this case cooperatively. Don't assume this is a given. There are many people who work with others grudgingly, and although it may seem to an observer there is a team of six people in a situation, it's really 4 team players and 2 others standing next to them working in their own silos. 
 The term, "self-invested" is an interesting term that stresses how the person is committed and motivated internally, without needing an employer to be constantly monitoring their activity. Self-invested people are not just present, they are present and engaged in what they are doing, taking pride in what they do. The rest of the bullet is just as critical. It communicates that you understand that achieving maximum profitability requires finding efficiencies; streamlining processes, looking for ways to get more accomplished requiring, speed, fewer distractions, less waste, commitment and a unified approach - ie. the common organizational goals. 
 Now imagine if your entire resume took what the employer is looking for and better communicated how hiring you will fulfill their needs and realize their end goals, and not just plop down your qualifications. 
 Take two resumes for a Cleaning / Maintenance position. The employer's posting states that the job requires mopping floors, cleaning office areas. One resume states: 
 
 Skilled at mopping floors and cleaning office spaces 
 
 An exact match for the employer's needs, but compare that to the 2nd resume: 
 
 Proven experience mopping and cleaning office areas, achieving full compliance with Ministry Health and Safety standards; ensure offices are welcoming for staff members daily 
 
 In this second bullet, not only does the applicant have the required experience, they are demonstrating that they know WHY they do what they do and HOW the work they do contributes to the overall productivity of the organization. They get the big picture. Staff who walk in to a clean office start feeling good and ready to go. Staff who walk into their office any other way are immediately distracted, waste time complaining or making a report. Meeting Health and Safety standards keeps the staff healthy and at work, and not needing time off for illness. In other words, both employees say they can clean but one did a better job communicating they understand the big picture and how their role fits.

 Personal Qualities And Finding A Fit 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  interviewing ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  mental health ,  philosophy ,  relationship building ,  team building 
 Almost every job description lists the qualifications required by an employer. Education, experience and demonstrated skills make up the bulk of the posting and in some instances, that's all that's provided. However, if these alone are enough for an employer to choose the candidates who will succeed, there'd be no need for personal interviews. 
 So once education, past and present experience and required skills are confirmed, employers turn to their interviewers to size up the people before them as good fits personally. For you the applicant, this part of the application process can be most frustrating. Many people lament lost opportunities even though they met all the stated requirements for employment. 
 It's critically important to be self-aware of how you come across to others; to know yourself. You may think you're coming across as self-confident and assertive when in reality, an interviewer sizes you up as aggressive, arrogant, self-important or conceited. You might promote yourself as a team player, but the interviewer might have serious doubts about how your going to fit in with the existing employees based on how you're coming across in the interview. This is especially true when you consider that interviews are typically where applicants are on their best behaviour. 
 Now as an applicant, you might not think this assessment of your personality and individual qualities is entirely fair. After all, you're under pressure and may be one of those people who performs great on the job itself but comes across poorly in an interview. Who is to say that the person interviewing you and making a hiring decision is good at assessing personalities and 'fit' in the first place? Further, if the truth is that interviewers have made up their minds about an applicant in the first 3 minutes or less after first meeting them, how much information are they really working on to make these career-changing assessments? 
 As an applicant, I recommend you concentrate on the things you can control and not those you can't. What you say and how you say it, how you dress, stand or sit, your eye contact, smile, advanced research, interpersonal skills, attitude, knowledge etc. - all these are within your control. So too are your tone and volume of speech, your vocabulary, warmth or lack thereof, tact and use of humour, insights, your handshake - again, all within your control. 
 I get that with so many things to think about, you might wonder how anyone could be successful! Thinking on all these things might just distract you from performing at your best and ironically result in you being passed over for jobs you'd otherwise be perfect for. This is the mindset of those who'd rather take the easy way and just wing an interview. They reason, "I can't know what the other person is thinking can I? So I'll just not bother or worry about all that stuff and just do the best I can." 
 For some this is a cop-out; not wanting to really invest themselves in the time it takes to prepare for an important interview. They may not get the job anyway, so it could be a big waste of time; time they'd rather spend doing things they enjoy, and interview practice is at the bottom of the list. They figure that only one person gets the job and so there will be a lot of disappointed people; many who did do their homework and practice ahead of time - and they failed too. So why bother? 
 Why bother indeed? The answer is because preparing gives you a better chance of succeeding. The odds go up considerably for those who take the time to prepare. Preparation will help you figure out what kind of person does well in one job vs. another kind of person. Sit outside the place of employment just watching people come and go and you can learn a great deal about how people dress and interact with fellow employees. Do they seem happy, stressed out, robotic or engaged? Have a meeting with those doing the job you'd like to land and you can ask about the atmosphere, what it takes to succeed, desired personal qualities and this is all part of the company culture that is promoted as desirable behaviour. 
 Now, if what you learn tells you that in truth you're not a good fit with an organization, think seriously about continuing to compete for a job there. You may fool some people and indeed get hired, but what if one of the people you fool is yourself? How long will you be happy and do you really want to be back job searching in 3 month's when you and/or the employer decide the fit just isn't there? 
 Want some solid advice? Get to know yourself. No, I'm not being flippant. Identify your personal qualities and ask friends, family and co-workers how you come across. Ask for honesty not flattery; the good and the not-so-charming. Be thankful for all the feedback you have and then armed with all you learn, start the hunt for the job and company where someone with your personal qualities PLUS experience, education and skills will be the best fit. 
 Way too many people ignore personal fit when looking at potential jobs and employers; yet its personal fit that every employer takes into consideration at every job interview. Unless they want a round peg in a square hole to shake things up, pay attention to finding the proper fit.

 You Need Acknowledgement, Progress And Success 
 Career advice ,  decisions ,  Employment Counselling ,  Job Search Advice ,  job searching ,  mental health ,  older workers ,  philosophy ,  relationship building ,  trust 
 Talk to anyone looking for a job and you'll find what they expect at the minimum is to have their efforts acknowledged and feel progress is being made towards ultimately being successful. 
 If a person applies for work repeatedly without any acknowledgement from employer's, or if they feel stuck without making any progress, their effort will likely ebb and flow at best, or they will give up altogether. 
 Now, depending on your personal circumstances, your motivation for seeking this new job and the results you are achieving, can have a significant impact on your self-worth, self-esteem and your confidence. Although very similar, they are different from one another, and all three are critical to your self-perception. You do want to feel good about yourself, feel valued; that you have something to give which others recognize and appreciate. When we feel appreciated, we feel better about who we are and that positivity carries over into other aspects of our lives. Without feeling valued, we can start to feel doubtful, our ability to contribute suspect, and our worth as a person comes into question. 
 Acknowledgement and progress lead to success no matter what the situation. Were you to buy some carrot seeds and plant them in the garden, you'd feel optimistic when you laid them in that shallow trench. With the first sightings of some fragile green leaves popping up through the soil, you'd feel encouraged. As the plants take root and sprout, the higher the green leaves grow, the more you believe the orange carrots below are getting bigger and thicker. The promise of successfully harvesting some vegetables becomes stronger. When you do dig up those carrots, there's satisfaction in washing them up and eating them. 
 However, without any seeds germinating, you wonder what went wrong. Not enough sun or water? Planted them too shallow or too deep? Bad soil? Bad seeds? Or maybe you just say you obviously don't have a green thumb. That lack of progress in seeing something grow can put you off trying again. If that lack of success happens not only with the carrots but also the onions, potatoes and tomatoes, you might believe you're not cut out to be a Gardener. In short, you'll give up. 
 The thing about growing your own vegetables is that if you've never done it before, you might ask others with more experience or at the very least, read the instructions on the packets you buy and follow the directions. When you do this, you're taking advice from professionals, and you do this because you trust their experience and want to give your seeds the best chance of ultimately being successful vegetables. 
 When it comes to applying for jobs, you'd be surprised how many people don't follow this same pattern of behaviour. No, a lot of people - perhaps yourself - go about applying for work as best they can figure out on their own. It's ironic don't you think that someone will buy a package of carrots for $1.50, read the instructions and follow the advice to the letter, but then ignore the advice that's available from professionals when it comes to finding work that could potentially bring in tens of thousands of dollars a year? 
 As I've said in many articles over the years, job searching without success is frustrating. That's got to be a major understatement of the obvious. However, job searching with progress or even basic acknowledgement is even more disheartening. Resumes and cover letters take time to make, applying online takes time as does even finding the right jobs in the first place. You feel your time is valuable, and the last thing you want to do is put in a lot of time and get nothing in return. For some, even just being acknowledged by an employer that they've received your résumé would be nice. 
 Look, you have to decide what's best for you personally. That has and will never change. If you are getting regularly acknowledged and are getting interviews, you might feel progress is being made and success is imminent. However, if you feel stuck and you're losing momentum or have no progress whatsoever, what are you going to do about it? Your choice would seem to be keep doing what you're doing and hope for a different result, or change what you're doing and hope for a different result. 
 Changing what you're doing is almost impossible if you don't consider advice from others who have had success in what you're trying to do - get a job. Without learning how others have gone about it, you'll just be guessing about what you need to change or how to go about things differently. For all we know, how you're going about looking for a job now might be like buying a packet of carrot seeds and planting the packet while still in the envelope or scattering the seeds on gravel. There's always a chance one or two might grow, but the odds are slim. 
 By all means, do what's best for you. Hammer away doing the same thing or enlist the help of a professional who can share some ideas on how to improve your odds of success. It starts with having your skills and experience as well as your applications acknowledged, moves forward with feeling you're making progress as interviews start coming, and ultimately you'll be successful when the job offer is made.
