  Define Career (I Bet You Get It Wrong)  
 J.T. O'Donnell 
 October 25, 2012 
 How do you define career? Have you ever written it out and really looked closely at it? Better still, have you ever made sure your definition is accurate? I challenge you to watch this video and then ask yourself if how you  define career  could be the reason you struggle to find the success and satisfaction you want and deserve. Watch and learn why the definition of  career  has changed so much in the last 20 years. You’ll be glad you did!
