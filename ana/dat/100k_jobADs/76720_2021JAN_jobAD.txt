 TAURUS HOROSCOPE JANUARY - CAREER 
 Posted by  lisalazuli

 Now available on amazon for Â£2,99 Kindle and $5.99 paperback 
 CAREER; A good time to re-organize spending and arrange cutbacks in your outgoings or that of your business. A great month to prepare budgets and forecasts for your business as you are realistic but not overly pessimistic. Try and bring down accumulated debt starting from this month. 
 A grounded attitude will help you in all dealings and financial matters; like I said in the opening paragraph, big decisions will be delayed until the end of the month. You may feel that your hand is being forced in certain respects, but that may be a misconception, so do get good advice on important matters. 
 A fair amount of mixing business with pleasure and also socializing with business colleagues and clients. It is a time for cooperation and improving the way you communicate and cooperate with your business contacts becomes central. 
 Whatever industry you are in, it is time to be more creative in the way you work and how you present your business to others. A new marketing plan or advertising initiative can be very effective. As the focus is value for money this month, you do not want to spend heavily on marketing, the idea is to use your creativity and imagination to make a little go a long way when it comes to publicity. It may be a simple thing such as making your website look more attractive and accessible or a new set of business cards and a new logo. Think of how you project yourself and how your image can improve.
