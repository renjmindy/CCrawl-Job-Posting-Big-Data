  Poll: Is Job Search Easier Today With Social Media?  
 Belen Chacon 
 February 19, 2013 
 When I graduated with my undergraduate degree two years ago, I was motivated to look for work in any way I could. I knew I couldn’t work the online job boards all day, so I decided to do some work - as was suggested by a friend - and went from business to business asking if they were looking to hire new employees. It came as a bit of a shock to me when most of the employers I went to go see turned me away and said, “You can apply online.” Then I did some investigating. I came to find out that while yes, there are job boards on the Internet, and most employers list any job openings for their company on their websites, you can also use  social media in your job search . With that in mind, do you think it's it easier to look for a job today with the rise of social media and other online technology? Please take our poll and tell us what you think in the comment section below! [poll id="118"] Photo Credit:  Shutterstock
