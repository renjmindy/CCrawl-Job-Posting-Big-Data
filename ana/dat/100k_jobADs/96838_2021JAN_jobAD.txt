 5 creative questions you should ask in an interview 
 To ace a job interview, you don’t just have to answer questions well—you also have to ask them. But posing boilerplate questions won’t make you stand out from other job candidates, and it won’t help you sniff out whether an employer would be a good fit, either. By spending some time thinking of creative questions to ask in an interview, you'll be doing yourself two favors. One, it'll show the employer that you went the extra mile and that you actually care about getting this job. Two, these kinds of questions can uncover some valuable information that might not have come up otherwise.  ](/job-interview/questions/creative-questions-to-ask-in-an-interview/article.aspx)

Thankfully, deciding on interview clothes is not something you need to lose sleep over.  ](/job-interview/appearance/colors-and-job-interview-clothes/article.aspx)
