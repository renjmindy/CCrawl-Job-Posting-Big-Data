 We are looking for a motivated and experienced Senior Engineer to help design, build and architect systems 
 Role overview 
 Help us Build the Future of Money 
 Gemini Trust Company, LLC (Gemini) is a licensed digital asset exchange and custodian. We built the Gemini platform so customers can buy, sell, and store digital assets (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Zcash) in a regulated, secure, and compliant manner. 
 Digital assets and blockchain technology have the power to transform the world for good. This truth, along with our core values, form the bedrock of our company and culture. At Gemini, no job is too small and no project too big as we endeavor to build the future of money. We are a mission-driven, team-based, inclusive, and determined community of thought leaders who invest in each other and the long game. Join us in our mission! 
 The Department: Engineering 
 Gemini is regulated and licensed like a bank, but itâ€™s run like a tech startup, and engineering is the core of the company. Thereâ€™s a wide range of tough problems to solve at Gemini â€“ from properly securing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of customer funds, to developing innovative new blockchain products, to finding new techniques to combat fraud, to shaving microseconds off our API response times, and everything in between. 
 All of Geminiâ€™s engineers are able to work across the software platform, not just on their own specialization or subteam. We value a thoughtful, collaborative software development process, coupled with a pragmatic approach to problem solving and delivering software. 
 The Role: Senior Software Engineer 
 As an engineer on our backend team, youâ€™ll architect and solve complex problems that will directly influence the direction of the digital asset space. Thereâ€™s a wide range of problems to solve at Gemini â€“ from properly securing millions of dollars worth of customer funds, to developing innovative new blockchain products, to shaving microseconds off our API response times. We have a strong culture of code reviews, and a focus on security, with the end goal of writing and shipping high-quality code by getting things right the first time. We want to continue building the best product we can as we scale and grow our business. If you get excited about solving technical challenges that directly impact our customers, clients, and the rest of the Gemini team, weâ€™d love to hear from you. This role can be based in our New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Singapore, or Portland, Oregon offices. 
 Responsibilities: 
 
 Develop new products and product features on the Gemini platform, as part of a tight knit team of two to eight developers. 
 Write automated tests and work with our QA team to ensure the operation and correctness of new product features. 
 Provide technical input and knowledge to the planning, design, and requirements process for new products and features. 
 Review other software engineersâ€™ code for correctness, style, and information security concerns. 
 Improve the performance, maintainability, and operations of the Gemini code base by engaging in occasional refactoring and upgrade projects. 
 Support your teamâ€™s production software by responding to an occasional alert or bug report. 
 
 Minimum Qualifications 
 
 At least 6 years of software engineering experience. 
 Advanced proficiency in at least one language. We use mostly  Scala  and  C++  on our backend and  Typescript  on the frontend â€“ itâ€™s great if youâ€™re comfortable in those or if youâ€™re willing to learn. 
 The ability to work closely across teams and manage dependencies. 
 A customer- and product-focused mindset, with the ability to make well-reasoned tradeoffs between speed and quality. 
 The ability to adapt and handle multiple competing priorities in collaboration with peers. 
 
 Bonus Qualifications 
 
 Experience working with or being a power user of  Bitcoin ,  Ethereum , and/or blockchain technology 
 Work experience or knowledge of the finance industry, payments, trading and/or exchange systems 
 
 Below is a snapshot of some of the specific teams hiring! 
 Wallet 
 Join the team responsible for adding digital assets to the platform, working with different blockchain protocols, and developing custody and storage systems. Recent projects include work in the decentralized finance (deFi) space and partnering with Filecoin as a network launch partner 
 Tech Platform 
 Help the Gemini tech organization move faster and safer through developer tooling and platform improvements! 
 Fiats/Finance/Payments 
 Help build the bridge between fiat and crypto! Youâ€™ll be responsible for building our Financial Operation responsibilities like payment processing, banking integration, settlements and reconciliations. 
 Marketing Tech 
 Market smarter. Gain valuable insights into our user base to deliver better, personalized experiences. Leverage audience analytics to help Gemini make informed decisions with real, measurable impact. 
 It Pays to Work Here 
 We take a holistic approach to compensation at Gemini, which includes: 
 
 Competitive base salaries across all departments 
 Ownership in the company via profit sharing units 
 Amazing benefits, 401k match contribution, and flexible hours 
 Snacks, Perks, Wellness Outings & Events
