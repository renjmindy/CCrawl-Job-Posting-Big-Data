 Read Proverbs Chapter 13 
 Job 24 
 1 Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days? 
 2 Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof. 
 3 They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge. 
 4 They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together. 
 5 Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children. 
 6 They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked. 
 7 They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold. 
 8 They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter. 
 9 They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor. 
 10 They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry; 
 11 Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst. 
 12 Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them. 
 13 They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof. 
 14 The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief. 
 15 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face. 
 16 In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light. 
 17 For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death. 
 18 He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards. 
 19 Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned. 
 20 The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree. 
 21 He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow. 
 22 He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life. 
 23 Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways. 
 24 They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn. 
 25 And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?

 Verse 13 NLT “Wicked people rebel against the light. They refuse to acknowledge its ways or stay in its paths." John 8:12 NLT says " Jesus spoke to the people once more and said, “I am the light of the world. If you follow me, you won’t have to walk in darkness, because you will have the light that leads to life.” We must heed the warnings and keep following Jesus, the light of the world. Many who are rebelling think they are doing fine; but, verses 22-24 CEV says this " But God’s mighty strength destroys those in power. Even if they seem successful, they are doomed to fail. God may let them feel secure, but they are never out of his sight. Great for a while; gone forever! Sinners are mowed down like weeds, then they wither and die."

 2. After all it's the wicked who seize land that belongs to others, capture flocks and let them graze for themselves, 
 3. Drive off orphans' donkeys, take as collateral widows' oxen, 
 4. Drive the needy off the road, and force the poor into hiding together. 
 Jeremiah 17:11 
11. Like a partridge that hatches eggs that are not hers, so is the person who gains wealth unfairly. In the middle of his life a fool's money will abandon him. In the end he, too, will be shown for what he is-a fool. The Voice

 Job 24:13-16 
13) They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof. 
14) The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief. 
15) The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face. 
16) In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light. 
 For those who "rebel against" and "know not" the LIGHT, darkness is a covering for them and their evil deeds. 
St. John 3:19-20 says, "And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved." 
 This is why I like the Prayer at the beginning of the blog. 
"Pray for God to send out His LIGHT and TRUTH and that souls be converted,…" 
 LORD, bring them out of darkness and into Your Marvelous LIGHT!!

 2 Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof. 
 Proverbs 22:28 
Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set. 
 Proverbs 23:10 
Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless: 
 The Bible constantly reminds us not to remove ancient landmarks. They are there for a reminder. 
 When I needs to remember how to get somewhere I always take a look at the landmarks around me. This helps me find my way to and from a location. As the church our fore fathers have set landmarks to help us in our journey. Removing them will cause us to forget how to make it back to our place of refuge in Christ.

 33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. 
 There's been so many times in my own life where verse 24 has happened. Remember that your first steps in a situation can sometimes be your most crucial.

 GO TO THE LIGHT 
 16 In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light. 
17 For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death. 
 As Job describes the attraction of the wicked to darkness and then asks for someone to contest him on it. I am reminded of the words of JESUS to the sin sick, darkened world. 
 John 8:12 Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. 
 John 9:5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. 
 John 12:46 I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness. 
 The children of JESUS are attracted to and safe in the LIGHT. As we GO with JESUS in 2017. Let us make a conscious decision to GO TO THE LIGHT which is Christ JESUS in all that we say and do.

 The world's way is to exalt themselves and pump themselves up but God's way is if you humble yourself he will lift you up. God always works opposite of the world. So let's stay humble and let God lift you up!

24 And though they are great now, in a moment they will be gone like all others, cut off like heads of grain. (NLT) 
 For those rebelling against the light, for those who think you're hidden in the night and darkness… He's still God and He works in the night. Take the word of God to heart and follow Him on the path of righteousness.

 Darkness is the absence of light. That is why when you have a flashlight and shine it in a dark room. It illuminates it. Nothing good came from the darkness,save creation when God spoke into it and created the heavens and the universe. You see when we want something in the dark we gamble on hitting our toes on the furniture, yet with a light source it is easier to move around. Now we all go through darker times on our lives. But that's when you and others truly see how much Jesus you really have in your life. Because the brighter you are in the dark times the more Jesus you have because he's the light of the world. I am reminded of the children's song, let your light shine. 
 So let it shine bright.

 God is a God of light. Regardless if people choose to walk in His light or not, it should always shine brightly, lighting the path for those to follow who choose to. 
 Don't allow the situation you are in to hid the light from shining in your life. Jesus will put people in your path who are searching for that light, and we don't want our deeds or actions to hid the way to where they can't see Him.

 15-16 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face. In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light. 
 One of the greatest lies of the enemy is that we can do things in secret; that we can hide our sin and it will never be found out. This is not true, but a lie of the enemy. God’s word tells us that everything that is done in secret or in the darkness will see the full light of day. It is easier to see sin in our brother or sister than in ourselves. It is even easier to see the sins in the world, and not in ourselves. There’s something self-righteous and hypocritical within a lot of Christians that cries out “You sinner!” 
 Shame on us. 
 Some believe that we can sin against God, our friends and family members and never be discovered or exposed. God says no. It is a certainty that it will be discovered. 
 Ephesians 5:11-16 MSG Don’t waste your time on useless work, mere busywork, the barren pursuits of darkness. Expose these things for the sham they are. It’s a scandal when people waste their lives on things they must do in the darkness where no one will see. Rip the cover off those frauds and see how attractive they look in the light of Christ. Wake up from your sleep, Climb out of your coffins; Christ will show you the light! So watch your step. Use your head. Make the most of every chance you get. These are desperate times!

 Jesus is the light of this world and there are some that don't want to know his ways. 12Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. John 8:12 
 There will always be some that do not want to know him or his ways, they prefer the darkness where no one can see their evil deeds. Yet he also said: 
7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. John 16:7 
God has an end time revival already planned (for the world & our region) and we must step into and participate in it - through following the plans before us at POFW.

 At time, this statement would have been true. But now, thieves dont care what time of day it is. They have lost all fear of God and authority. Our society has led us into not to fear God. We have distance ourselves farther from God, and consequences are being felt. No longer are sins conducted in the dark, people have no shame and just flaunt sin in broad daylight these days.

 Something Job does not realize is how the wicked get punished for the things they do. You may see them get punished in the natural world but when they pass away, they could face an eternity of hell for the things they have done. We can't just look at things how we see them with our natural eye, but look at things with our spiritual eyes.

 Jobs cry for a swift resolution to the trail that he is suffering is a familiar one. Everyone wants God's timing to be their timing. It is so very hard to wait for him to act when everything within us is screaming for an end to the pain. From Genesis to Revelation, God's timing is perfect. The apostle Peter reminds us that God operates on a whole different timetable than we do- for the best of reasons (2Pe 3:8-9).

 It is like a thief in the night: the enemy uses the darkness to bring those that will destroy God's children. As I read this chapter it reminded of a time where I allowed the enemy to attack me in the night. I lost my Mother in 2007 and allowed the enemy to steal the joy of the time that I got to spend with her. I began to rebel and paid the price for it at a later time. I now know that the darkness can come against me, but I have to rejoice and praise God to make it past the darkness. It took a long time for me to understand the light of the Lord; now that I have a better understanding. It has helped me to know that as long as God is with me; No one can stand against me……Thank you Jesus…..Amen!!!! 
 Isaiah 54:17 King James Version (KJV) 
 17 No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord. 
 Isaiah 54:17 Amplified Bible (AMP) 
 17 “No weapon that is formed against you will succeed; 
And every tongue that rises against you in judgment you will condemn. 
This [peace, righteousness, security, and triumph over opposition] is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, 
And this is their vindication from Me,” says the Lord.

 Job 24:23-24 (MSG) 
23 They may have an illusion of security, 
but God has his eye on them. 
24 They may get their brief successes, 
but then it's over, nothing to show for it. 
Like yesterday's newspaper, 
they're used to wrap up the garbage. 
 Recently someone confessed to me that they were a completely different person in public, and they are very good at putting on a show to make people believe they are someone they are not. 
 This troubles me because the wages of sin is death. Without a relationship with Jesus all of life is frivolous and fading away. We enjoy relationships but one day they too will come to an end. 
 Jesus said it like this 
Matthew 6:19-20 (KJV Strong's) 
19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: 20 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: 
 Life isn't worth cheap investments. We must be like the merchant of pearls and sell all for what truly matters. 
 In eternity with Jesus we truly have everything we could ever need or want. Without Jesus we have absolutely nothing at all.

 And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?(Job 24:25) 
 Job spoke saying to his friends that accused him of sinning against God that if they can prove him guilty that he will shut up. Job declares his innocence in the presence of his accusers as he pleads for God to prove his innocence and liberate him. No one has the right to judge other people because that's for God alone.

 13 They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof. 
 God cannot be mocked. To Him the dark is as the light. He can see all things and be at all places and there is nothing that can escape or hide from God. Let us God to the Light, to Jesus that we so shine and lead others on the way to Him.

 2 Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof 
 Many will forgot where God has brought them from but we cannot afford to in this day and age. God brought us to far to turn around now! God is good!

 Why do we seek His light in death as some stories are told? Why can't we seek His light and know Him now so we aren't lost on the journey? The little children's nursery rhyme says let our light shine for all the world to see. We may not know our path and we try to make our own path through time, but God knows our path as He knows Job's path. He guides us both back on track in His time so that we will receive our reward through our faith.

 ““But if Judgment Day isn’t hidden from the Almighty, why are we kept in the dark? " 
MSG 24:1 
 Some people see to be rewarded here where everyone can see. Others seem like they don't get any recognition for the good or the bad. Why? We don't know, but there is another scripture in the Bible that reminds me of this. 
 “And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores, And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.” 
‭‭Luke‬ ‭16:20-25‬ ‭KJV‬‬ 
 While he was alive no one understood, but when they died they received their rewards. We are now t the judge of people. God is.

 4 They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.

 ““Wicked people rebel against the light. They refuse to acknowledge its ways or stay in its paths.” 
‭‭Job‬ ‭24:13‬ ‭NLT‬‬ 
 Those that rebel against the truth. Don't desire to know the truth or notice it 
 I desire wisdom of the truth.

 For a little while they are exalted, and then they are gone; they are brought low and gathered up like all others; they are cut off like heads of grain. 
Job 24:24 NIV 
 Fame and money can take you places and can make you somebody but even that only last a while but if we follow Jesus He lasts forever. He will exalt us if we humble ourselves.

 Don't rebel against the all mighty Lord!! I pray for all the backsliders to come to the Lord. I don't know how anyone can live without the Loed especially if they've already known Him. I never want to leave your side Lord because I can't live without you!!!! I need you daily!!! In you I trust conpletely….
