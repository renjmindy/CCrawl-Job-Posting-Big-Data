 The reasons I love my job. 
 The reasons I love my job. 
 May 16, 2014May 16, 2014   wordynerdbird 
 I really love some of the people I work with. I need both hands to count the awesome people that I consider to be my friends as well as my workmates. I don't need to name them. They know who they are. 
 There is a lot to be said for knowing that there is always someone who you can always turn to for advice, a shoulder, or a laugh. 
It's refreshing to know that when someone smiles at you, they mean it. 
When they ask if you are doing OK, you can be honest because they actually want to know. 
I can tell them when I'm struggling, and I can share my joys and victories with them. 
They see humour in the things that make me laugh, and they will cry with me, or for me, on those days when that is really my only option. 
They know, too, that I will do the same for them. It's really great to know that I can make the difference in their day that they make in mine. 
 Some of the greatest joys in my working life come from knowing who those people are and sharing part of my life with them. I am thankful for each one of them every day. To be honest, those people are often the difference between me actually being happy to go to work or not. 
 Don't get me wrong: I love my job. I love working with my students and seeing them grow in confidence and knowledge. I thrive on classroom interaction and banter. I have positive student-teacher relationships with most, although not all, of my students. They know I do my absolute best for them. 
When I am teaching, I know I'm doing what I'm meant to be doing. 
 There are times, though, when being at work and functioning properly is a really tough challenge. Some days are just plain, hard work both emotionally and physically. 
I hate it that I'm so weak and vulnerable. I hate it that my body lets me down. I hate it when my students see a glimpse of my pain or my inability to cope with it. 
I hate the guilt that goes with all of that. 
 One of my greatest fears is that someone will decide I'm not up to it anymore, or I'm not good enough, or that I'm too broken to keep on teaching. 
So I suck it up, put my sassy pants on, and keep going. I choose to invest my time and energy into my students and my friends. The days are much more rewarding and enjoyable that way. 
A long walk up to the staff room doesn't happen any more often than absolutely necessary, and that's OK. 
I'm not isolated because I am blessed to share an office with some of my friends. Others make a point of catching up with me through the day or by email or instant message. 
It's hard to feel sorry for yourself with friends like mine. 
 I really do love some of the people I work with. 
Othersâ€¦ not so much.

 You're very, lucky to have such great friends eho support you. One of the reasons I'm having such a hard time is I didn't make many friends and those I thought I made disappeared when I got sick. It makes it easier to decide to move away, when I know I'll get to be with somone who loves me for me.
