 Full-time job, conversation ring and cinema 
 Posted on  April 13, 2016November 29, 2019  by  Emil 
 Interviews and a full-time job 
 Before I finally find a full-time job there were several interviews. Like I already wrote in a  previous blog post  I had last week almost every day the job interview. On Monday it was a call from  Bond  to email marketing position, on Tuesday dishwashing for  Doomies vegan restaurant , on Wednesday dishwashing for  Kumpert and Kim  also a vegan restaurant and finally on Thursday kitchen help for an  aroma espresso bar . 
 The feelings were not bad after every interview I had, I was prepared, always is good to read a little bit about the company you want to be hired, I was finally neat :), black trousers, black sweater, so there was no problem I think:). 
 But the response came just from the Aroma espresso, Actually, I am glad, because that was my favorite one. (I was actually sure that will get this position, so I canceled another interview to a different branch of an aroma espresso bar, but they called after 4 days, so I was little insecure, have to admit :)) ) 
 Problem with the previous interviews could be, that I was super confident ðŸ™‚ (be confident is good) but I may be swept it a little. It was just dishwashing position and I am already dishwashing in  Ovest , so I said on both interviews, that I don't want just dishwashing, but maybe doing also food preparation and so, also I wasn't sure about my availability. As I had interviewed every day, I didn't clarify which day I can work where, so I wasn't sure which days can promise. That was a big mistake I think. Also in an interview with Kumpert and Kim, when the interviewer asked me about my availability I said something like "If I will like it here, I can work here full-time" :)). Better to choose more cautious words. 
 
 Working tip 3 : Learnt something about company you want to be hired and check your availability before the interview, dont say setencess like "If I will like it here, I can work here full-time" :)), be caution what you say ðŸ™‚ 
 
 The aroma is a coffee bar, something like Starbucks, but nicer!:) I will be helping in the kitchen but there is possible also be trained for barista or cashier. So I hope I can do it later. It should be useful in the future :). I am now in training week in Aroma so will see, if they actually hire me. Wish me luck. 
 English conversation circle 
 
 On Wednesday I visited the  Toronto public library in Parkdale , where took place English conversation circle. It is just a bunch of people (mostly the immigrants or foreigners), which just speak about everything to practice English. It is really good and I definitely want to go there every week. I am looking for more of these opportunities to meet new people because as I am here alone it's always good to speak with somebody :). 
 Royal cinema - videofreex 
 I was bored so on Friday a went to a cinema. I choose not a big cineplex, but small local  Royal cinema  in College street. They screened  Here come the Videofreex . A documentary about a group called Videofreex, which began to record in the late sixties, when the first portable video camera from Sony was released. It was really good and definitely recommend!:) 
 
 
 
 
 
 Other staff. 
 Still going to Thai box, a free week is gone so have to buy a monthly membership, it cost 120 CAD, but I have to do something here, otherwise, it will be super boring :). And next weekend of dishwashing in OVEST is behind me, the people are there really great, I want to stay there although I got the job in Aroma. ðŸ™‚ 
 Next week passed quickly. I found full-time job whoooo, ðŸ™‚ (I hope will see in next blog post if they hire me or not :)), watched a movie, still go to thaibox and moreâ€¦ I think that slowly but surely settle down here in Toronto. Finally :)). 
 Keep tuned and read to me next week!:)
