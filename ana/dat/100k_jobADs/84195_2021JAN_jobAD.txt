 Telugu Voice over artist needed 
 Published: 5 days ago  Bids: 2 
 For a new project, we are looking for individuals who can provide us the translation and dubbing of videos for YouTube in Telugu. 
 Male voice only. 
 Content is 13+. 
The project is long-term. Examples of videos you can find on the channel Kiraak Timon. 
Just search for it. All published videos are bad examples. We need a person who really can sound full of life, crazy and funny. 
 Decent audio recordings are necessary, phone quality is not acceptable. 
The person should play with the voice according to what's happening in the video, not just boring dubbing. 
 Some help with translation would be needed as well. 
 It is a long-term contract for the person who will deliver really amazing audios.
