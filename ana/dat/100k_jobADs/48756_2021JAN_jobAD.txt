 What is a Barback? 
 This is a junior role for someone who wants to work as a barista, bartender or even bar manager, in the future. Barbacks usually undertake simple tasks and mainly support the more experienced bar staff before they're able to take orders, serve customers and mix drinks without supervision. 
 What does a Barback do? 
 Barbacks work behind-the-scenes to support bartenders and waiters during their shift. They also assist with bar opening and closing procedures. 
 Barback responsibilities include: 
 
 Collecting glassware and cleaning up the bar area 
 Replacing beer kegs and liquor bottles 
 Refilling ice bins 
 
 Job brief 
 We are looking for a Barback to support our Bartenders and the rest of our staff. You’ll assist with bar opening and closing procedures and perform various behind-the-bar tasks, such as restocking the bar and preparing garnishes. 
 If you’re interested in kickstarting your career in the hospitality industry, this is a great opportunity to get first-hand experience of how a bar operates. 
 Ultimately, you’ll help ensure that our guests get an excellent customer service and enjoy their time at our bar. 
 Note that, to be considered for this role, you should be legally authorized to work in a bar where alcoholic beverages are served and consumed. You should also be available to work in shifts, including evenings, weekends and public holidays. 
 Responsibilities 
 
 Tidy up tables, counters and other bar areas 
 Collect empty glasses and bottles 
 Restock the bar with straws, coasters and napkins 
 Prepare mixers, juices and cocktail garnishes 
 Replenish peanuts and fruits 
 Change out beer kegs and replace liquor bottles 
 Remove trash and wipe down drink spills 
 Refill ice bins 
 Clean rags throughout the shift 
 Assist the Bartenders during rush hours 
 
 Requirements 
 
 Minimum age to serve alcohol 
 Interest in the hospitality industry; previous entry-level experience in a bar or restaurant is not mandatory, but will be considered a plus 
 Ability to work in a fast-paced environment 
 Team spirit 
 Basic knowledge of bar menu items and recipes (different types of beers and mixed drinks) 
 Physical ability to lift beer kegs, hold trays of bottles and glassware and stand during the shift 
 Flexibility to work during evenings, weekends and public holidays 
 High school diploma; additional certification in mixology or hospitality is a plus
