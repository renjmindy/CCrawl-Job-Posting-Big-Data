 Job: Supervisor - Library & Technical Services 
 Posted on  October 30, 2013  by   sarahgprescott 
 10/06/13  Supervisor - Library & Technical Services 
 Higher Colleges of Technology, United Arab Emirates 
 Sarah P 's comment : There are 13 campuses spread all over the UAE and experiences range from good to awful. I suspect this position would be at Central Services in Abu Dhabi. Nice city, pleasant country overall and the most moderate of the Gulf countries however be careful of working with the top management here as 'off with her/his head' is the norm. Or as one professor I knew put it the motto of HCT is  " to set up your subordinate to fail and then blame him" . In this system you are better off being a simple librarian down in Al Ain or over in Fujeirah and staying away from all the politics and strife. Here is a link to a website that reveals all:  HCT Sucks!
