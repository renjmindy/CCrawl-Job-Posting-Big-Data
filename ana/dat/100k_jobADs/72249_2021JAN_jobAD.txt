 Have you ever met one of those women who just  shine  naturally. Her smile, laugh, cheerful demeanor, love and care for others is known and felt by all who come in contact with her. 
 I've recently been able to meet one such of these incredible individuals at my workplace. Everyday it was a real delight to work with her and she so inspired me. Oh, and by any stretch of the imagination, did this woman have a carefree, easy-going life? She faithfully juggled a busy, full-time job, a handicapped school-aged child, a husband who directed and owned a successful business and was in the process of building their own home - yet every day she would waltz into work with a beaming smile and took her work's commitments with just as much enthusiasm and devotion! 
 I learned so much from this quietly, powerful woman. Day by day her glowing presence made me realize that there is a certain beauty that can been seen and positiveness revealed in each day - either good or bad. 
 Oh, and don't be concerned if you feel like me and you're way behind the eight-ball - maybe you're having a hell of a day. Well, firstly let me tell you, if you're reading this blog, then you're one step ahead in actually  desiring  to change. Secondly, I give an award to any woman out there who has a  vision to grow  and develop her capabilities and talents. Start where you are today - whatever you're doing. Washing dishes? Dealing with difficult clients? Picking up the kids from school? 
 Capture this moment and  shine!  Perhaps even pick out a characteristic that you'd like to work on and start with that! Why not give it a go! 
 Oh, and if you happen to have a bit of success in capturing this vision and  shining  - drop your thoughts in the comment box below!
