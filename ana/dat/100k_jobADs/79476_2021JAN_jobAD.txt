 Maltese injunction puts NetEnt AB job losses on hold 
 __ Adam Morgan 
 __ December 15, 2020

 In  Malta  and online casino software developer  NetEnt AB  has reportedly been hit with an injunction that has temporarily prevented it from instituting over 300 redundancies as part of its recent acquisition by  Evolution Gaming Group AB . 
 According to a Friday report from the  Malta Today  newspaper, the Superior Court decision came following an application from the General Workers' Union (GWU) that alleged the firm was about to break European and local laws because it had not informed or consulted with trade unions regarding  the proposed mass layoff . 
 Consolidation consequences: 
 NetEnt AB  is responsible for a live casino studio in the Maltese community of  Qormi  and revealed in June that it was being bought by  Evolution Gaming Group AB  as part of  an around $2.12 billion all-share deal . The firm had reportedly  intended to dismiss 324 employees  as its new owner is already responsible for nine such  live-dealer  facilities including one in the nearby Valletta suburb of  Birkirkara . 
 Arguable approach: 
 However, the  GWU  filed a lawsuit on December 5 amid claims that NetEnt AB was engaging in ‘  anti-union tactics  ’ by keeping it in the dark regarding the redundancies and negotiating a termination package  via an employee representative appointed by the developer itself . The union furthermore contended that this agent had been dismissive of its own pleas and that their selection  had breached a range of legal information and consultation obligations . 
 Reportedly read a statement from the GWU… 
 “Thanks to the court’s intervention following our urgent request, 324 illegal dismissals  have now been put on hold . We will continue to insist that NetEnt AB and Evolution Gaming Group AB honor their consultation obligations in full and  we will do our utmost to ensure that jobs are saved  and, where that is not possible, that appropriate compensation is paid.” 
 Subsequent step: 
 The newspaper reported and the government of  Malta  is assisting those now at risk of losing their jobs  via the establishment of a special telephone helpline  while both parties are due to give oral arguments via a specially-appointed  Superior Court  sitting beginning from Thursday.
