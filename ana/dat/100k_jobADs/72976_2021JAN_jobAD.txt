The Bottom of a Bottle 
 Trust me, I've been there, I've looked, I've searched and I know now, that there are no answers to be found in the bottom of a bottle or on the edge of a blade! Fighting Hard, Recovering, Rebuilding, REBORN. Moving on from addiction to a new life.

 Look Around – Job 12:9-10 
 Look around 
 What do you see? 
 Take a walk in the countryside 
 Marvel at the birds in the tree 
 Walk the shores 
 Feel the sand between the toes 
 Set off upon the waves 
 Wonder at the tide that ebbs and flows 
 Wander between the mountains 
 That reach out to heaven’s skies 
 Feel the snows that fall in seasons 
 Remember the majesty before your eyes 
 For all the things 
 Created by the Maker’s hand 
 And here we are His children 
 Amazed at the creation within which we stand 
 
 Job 12:9-10

 To All Who Are Lost – Job 12:9-10 
 To all that are lost 
 Alone without hope 
 Know there is one 
 He who carries your world 
 His hand upon you 
 With every breath taken 
 The Father of all 
 Life for the living 
 So do not give in 
 Never abandon hope 
 Seek out the Father 
 And return 
 To your rightful home

 Do We Not Know? – Job 12:9-10 
 All that we have 
 All that we hold 
 Is this our doing? 
 Did we create it all? 
 Do we not know? 
 Can we not feel? 
 The Lord’s hand in it all 
 His hand over our lives 
 His breath in our lungs 
 That’s all that we need 
 All we must hold

 Touch (Job 12:9-10) 
 I know You 
 Felt Your touch 
 There upon my shoulder 
 A touch upon my life 
 A saving hand 
 To draw a life 
 From the darkest shadows 
 A touch of Your healing hand 
 I rise again 
 Your breath in my lungs 
 I live again

 Job 12:9-10 
 I know what the hand of the Lord has done in life and I give thanks for everything that He has done for me. 
 Two days to go! 
 CHAINS HIT THE GROUND by LEELAND 
 I’m holding on to You 
 It’s all I know to do 
 When fear has had me bound 
 When enemies surround 
 There’s freedom in this truth 
 My salvation is in You 
 And I remember the nails that You took for me 
 When You died in my shame and iniquity 
 Jesus, You have set me free 
 The thorns of my pain You wore in a crown 
 When You bowed Your head 
 Your love was poured out 
 And my chains hit the ground 
 You are the Rock I’ve found 
 Above the shifting ground 
 Amid a raging war 
 You’re the One I’m fighting for 
 For all of my years 
 My banner will be clear 
 I am Yours 
 And even though the waves, they crash below 
 I’m holding onto love 
 I’m holding onto love 
 I am Yours 
 Forever all my days, I lay before Your holy love 
 I’m holding onto love
