 “I hired Dr. Barbara Seifert is a career coach when I lost my job as a result of restructuring. I found her to be a much more impactful career coach than I ever expected even with just a few coaching sessions. After working with her, I now see actions I can take and pathways to success that I didn't see before. My search is more productive now; I'm interviewing actively. I would gladly recommend Dr. Seifert to anyone seeking a career and/or success coach.”  Joe P., Orlando, Fl 
 I first met Barbara at a networking meeting; I was feeling frustrated with the way my business was operating. After our meeting, I was able to redefine my vision and niche, develop and market a life coaching program, set up a nonprofit organization, developed a website, created a new brand for my business, and hired an administrative assistant. I have doubled my billable hours more than in the last 15 years. The 10 minutes she gave me literally changed my life and I'm thankful. Meeting her was a life-changing moment."  - - David Hargrove Baker, Ph. D. 
 
 What are 5 strengths you have as a coach? 
 
 1. Ability to establish a relationship quickly 
2. Ability to see “the big picture” and the possibilities; intuitive 
3. Knowledge, tools and resources 
4. Not afraid to discuss client issues, whether good or bad 
5. Ability to listen without judgment; see a situation from all sides 
 
 What is your coaching philosophy? 
 
 I believe that self-awareness is the key to reaching our life goals, so my job as a coach is to help clients to understand themselves, i.e. why they behave as they do. This will allow them to be more aware of their motivations and desires, recognize their strengths, set manageable goals and focused strategies that will lead them to that desired end-result. I am the catalyst for this awareness; I have the tools and resources, as well as the accountability that will drive – and keep them- moving forward. While coaching is client-directed, I also feel that clients come to us for answers and my role is to lead them to the answers they seek. 
 
 What types of people do you typically coach? 
 
 My client list includes ages from high school students to older workers. I have coached clients who are just entering the workforce through those leaving, such as retirement. I have worked with blue collar workers through professionals, such as attorneys and business owners. My clients encompass 3 areas: 
1. Career changers/job seekers 
2. Workers having difficulty in the workforce 
3. Corporate clients
