 Worksource Montgomery  |  Career Support  |  Who We Serve  |  50+ 
 WorkSource Montgomery believes older workers provide a vital component of our economy and workforce. American Job Center staff can assist older workers in their job searches and in identifying other resources to help them. 
 Jewish Council for the Aging Services 
 The Jewish Council for the Aging (JCA)  assists eligible older workers through their older worker programs and brings these services to the Wheaton American Job Center. 
 JCA operates the Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP). SCSEP provides paid, on-the-job training for low-income men and women age 55 and older who live in Montgomery County. The organization also runs an annual 50+ Employment Expo (see below), six SeniorTech Computer Training Centers, and The Career Gateway — an intensive job-search  training program  for computer-savvy job-seekers age “50 or better.” 
JCA can be contacted directly at  301-255-4200 . 
 50+ Employment Expo (Job Fair) 
 WorkSource Montgomery joins the Jewish Council for the Aging (JCA) to organize and have a presence its annual job fair. Many seniors are still actively working and others want to stay relevant and contribute via a new “sunset career.” Statistics show that keeping one’s mind active leads to a longer, healthier life, and being connected to others through paid work, volunteering or hobbies helps to do just that! Please keep checking our calendar to see when it’s happening this year. 
 Older Adults Technology Services (OATS) 
 Some seniors are wary of computer usage, worry about personal identity theft and generally distrust information demanded by websites in order to pursue a job search. This service helps seniors with computers, smart devices and apps like Facebook so they can stay connected to friends and family. Learn more by visiting one of our  centers . 
 Senior Planet Montgomery 
 Senior Planet Montgomery  works with local libraries, senior centers, and other community partners to offer digital technology courses, workshops, and lectures geared toward people 60-plus. OATS launched Senior Planet in New York, NY in 2013 and has since expanded their program to Montgomery County.
