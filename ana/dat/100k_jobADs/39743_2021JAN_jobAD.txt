 Coach Profile 
 Vince Randazzo 
 How will clients benefit with you as their coach? 
 Clients are able to better articulate their value proposition, address work/life issues, improve their leadership skills, maximize their strengths and unlock latent potential. 
 What results have clients reported after working with you? 
 The stated achievements of my clients include improvements in executive presence, confidence and mindfulness, strategic planning, alignment of priorities with organizational goals and objectives, and creating value. 
 What do clients say about working with you? 
 My clients say that their leadership competencies are more developed as a result of working with me as a coach, and they are better equipped to handle the challenges and opportunities that confront them in their job and career. They will also say that I am easy to work with, and I have a style and demeanor that facilitates dialogue and self-discovery. 
 What is your coaching philosophy? 
 As an executive leadership coach, I partner with my clients in a thought-provoking and creative process that inspires personal and professional growth. My coaching process is directed toward solving problems, improving performance, attaining goals, and achieving results. 
 What strengths do you have as a coach? 
 
 Executive leadership experience 
 Flexibility in style and approach 
 Ethical behavior 
 A passion for helping others succeed 
 Emotional intelligence 
 
 What types of clients do you work with? 
 My coaching clients have included trade association and senior corporate executives, federal government officials, public affairs professionals, engineers, and entrepreneurs. Most have been individuals who are identified within their organizations as high-potential leaders, and coaching is offered as a leadership development and retention tool. 
 What is your professional background? 
 I am an International Coach Federation (ICF) designated Associate Certified Coach who works as a consultant offering leadership development, coaching and public affairs services to corporations and not-for-profit organizations and their executives. As an executive leadership coach, my coaching clients have included engineering, technology and financial services professionals, as well as leaders in government and the military. 
 Buttressing my coaching practice is a professional, managerial, and executive leadership career spanning more than three decades in government, business, and public policy. I served as a Senior Vice President at both Wachovia Corporation, and then at the PNC Financial Services Group, where I prepared senior executives in the companies on how to effectively engage community stakeholders, lead industry coalitions and advance public policy initiatives that were important to the strategic success of the organizations. 
 As an executive with the Business Roundtable, an association of CEOs of leading U.S. companies, I instructed corporate leaders on numerous engagement efforts that successfully achieved the organization's strategic objectives. 
 While working on Capitol Hill, I served as a staff leader for two key committees. As Chief of Staff to the House Rules Committee, I led a 25-person staff, and advised Congressional leaders and committee chairs on the development and execution of successful strategies that advanced the majority party's agenda. As Deputy Minority Staff Director for the House Financial Services Committee, I worked as a team leader of staff professionals responsible for press operations, speech-writing and strategic planning during consideration of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. 
 I completed George Mason University's professional training program in Leadership Coaching for Organizational Performance, and I am a graduate of Eastern Michigan University with a Bachelor of Science degree in political science and George Mason University with a Master of Arts degree in economics.
