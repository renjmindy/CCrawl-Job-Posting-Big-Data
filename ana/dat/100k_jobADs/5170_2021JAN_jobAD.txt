 Craft CMS/Commerce/Plugin Developer REMOTECONTRACT 
 Job Description 
 Hello, I'm a freelance web designer relatively new to Craft CMS. I'm looking for another freelancer who is experienced with Craft and can develop plugins and make customisations to Craft. I'm predominantly a designer/front-end guy so would love to form an ongoing relationship with someone who can handle custom developing and programming. 
 I have a current project that needs a custom plugin for a payment gateway (Secure Trading) to handle subscriptions as well as importing entries via CSV, bulk editing entries and sending email notifications among other things. 
 How to Apply
