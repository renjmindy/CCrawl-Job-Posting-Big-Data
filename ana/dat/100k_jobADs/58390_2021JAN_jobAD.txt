 College, Career, & Civic Life (C3) Survey 
 August 30, 2017  ~  kdslglobal 
 Invitation for Social Studies K-12+ Educators 
 Dear Educator, 
 Social Studies education underpins a strong democracy-your participation in this survey regarding the implementation of the _College, Career, & Civic Life (C3) Framework for Social Studies State Standards _will provide documentation that can be used by Social Studies advocates to seek private and federal funding for Social Studies education. 
 (If you have never heard of  C3  , please hit reply to email  kimdoneil@gmail.com  and indicate your state, district, and/or school. This information is very important to the study. All contact information will remain confidential.) 
 Data will be analyzed and reported in a white paper by Kevin Simpson, Founder, KDSL Global, and Kim O'Neil, NCSS President 2015-16. 
 The survey will take 10-15 minutes. By completing this survey by  September 15th  , your name will be placed in a drawing for a $50 Amazon gift card. Participants may receive a copy of the published white paper if requested. All contact information will remain confidential. 
 Please participate in this important   survey   . 
 If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me. Please forward this email to as many K-12+ educators as possible. Your time is greatly appreciated! 
 Best regards, 
 Kim O'Neil
