 In Honor of Careers in Construction Month 
 0  October 1, 2013   Careers in Construction ,  featured 
 Build Your Future (BYF) has declared October  Careers in Construction Month  and one great example of groups embracing that spirit is the partnership between BYF, CARBO Ceramics,  Robins & Morton  and the Jenkins County School System in Georgia. 
 Together, these groups have planned various construction-related activities throughout the month to engage students in elementary school, middle school and high school. Check out the [schedule of events](/Portals/1/Documents/Newsline/2013/C in C activities 10 13 (3).pdf) for more information on what they are doing. 
 In addition, BYF, Robins & Morton and CARBO Ceramics’ joined forces in August to donate more than 1,000 backpacks to Jenkins County elementary and middle school students. NCCER also donated textbooks, teacher resources and various educational tools to the school staff. 
 
 Do you have some events planned for Careers in Construction Week or do you want to host one? Find best practices and a place to register projects on  byf.org .
