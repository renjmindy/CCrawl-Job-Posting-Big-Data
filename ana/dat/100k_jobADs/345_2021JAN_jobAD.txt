 Keywords can be added to a job in the job editor on the same page where you enter the job description. This field is not required to post a job. 
 The primary function of keywords is to be matched to candidates' profiles. When someone applies for a position, any keywords that are included in their application will be noted on their profile in Workable. 
 Some (but not all) job boards use these keywords to improve visibility on your post. However, we recommend including search terms that a candidate might use to find your job in the text of the description/requirements naturally. For example, include a sentence saying "If you have a background in e-commerce [...]" in your description, as opposed to only mentioning "e-commerce" in the keywords field. 
 The   Keyword Matches  section will list any keywords that were in the candidate's resume info.
