 About us 
 Collectable is an investing platform and community for sports fans. As the first and only fractional ownership platform exclusively dedicated to sports, we're democratizing access to rare, valuable, and culturally significant collectibles and investment opportunities in the sports world. 
 We currently have a mobile app on iOS and Android Play stores, with a growing and highly engaged user base. Our users are able to participate in IPOs in the app, and we are soon to launch our secondary market where users will be able to trade shares with other users. We also have plans to launch a web version of our product in the coming months as well to increase our reach. 
 The Team 
 You'll be joining a small and collaborative team, which includes two other developers, a Product Manager, and designer. While our product team is located in London, Collectable is an American company and a number of our team, including our CEO, are based in the US. 
 This is a remote role - you're welcome to work from where ever suits; however, our team standups are at 0915h GMT, so UK based is preferred to align our working times. 
 Tech 
 Although we don't require you have experience in all of our tech-stack, the more of the following you have experience with the better! We use: 
 
 React Native 
 ReactJS 
 Node.js 
 GraphQL 
 Typescript 
 CDK/CloudFormation 
 Postgres 
 AWS (Lambda and CI/CD) 
 GitHub Actions 
 eslint/prettier 
 
 If you are interested, please send us through your CV/portfolio/GitHub/side projects along with a short cover letter about who you are and what you are into.
