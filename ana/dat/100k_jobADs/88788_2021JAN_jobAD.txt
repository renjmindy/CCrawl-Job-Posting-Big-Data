 Last day at my job 
 revolutionarymusings   Uncategorized  December 31, 2018 4 Minutes 
 Today was the last day at my job and I've written a lot about it; I've been so depressed about it and today was no exception. At the time same it's pretty bittersweet; I have been working for the last 2 years and I feel so tired; a part of me is looking forward to enjoying the rest; volunteering more; make it to church on Sunday and finding time to write and of course going back to school. So I am trying to have a positive attitude about all of this and I also tell myself that this was seasonal and they let go of almost everyone; so I can't take it personally. It really wasn't a bad last day; them letting me go was not a result of an emotional breakdown or me quitting in anger ( unlike every other job in the past); it's all circumstances beyond my control; my old store was closing and I took the job as a means of making money during holidays; knowing full well it was seasonal. I am proud of the job I did; I managed my emotions; I showed up on time everyday; didn't complain and worked hard and a lot of my co-workers have mentioned how hard of a worker I am. I am grateful I didn't have to be at Sears until the very end; I am grateful to God for blessing me this short time at this new job and giving me the strength to make it through all this; it was tough. I also felt good that a lot of people wished me luck; I got a lot of hugs and people seemed genuinely sad to see me go; they realized how much this job meant to me. 
 I am just struggling to figure how I am going to deal with all of my anxious thoughts and depression with so much free time; I feel rejected in a sense that I wasn't picked to stay. I have been irritable and I have felt rejected both by this job and by trying to contacting people I've known life and getting ignored responses; it hurts. So I know I am in a middle of a depressive episode and I pray God will get me through this. I hope by writing I can make sense of my feelings; so they don't build up. So if my blogs seem erratic; just know I am struggling with these changes in my life. I have no idea what's ahead but I do know I am ready for whatever comes ahead. 
 I also wanted to talk about something that I haven't shared on my blog or any of my social media; which is amazes because I have a history of being so anxious about these things. In fact I have managed to keep it all to myself and not ask anyone for advice; that's a first. Anyways there was this girl at work that I met a few weeks ago; she seemed really nice and she was in college and I told her I really liked to write; I had a blog and how I loved school; she seemed real interested and whenever I was on break; she'd sit next to me ( along with a lot of other women; I don't sit with guys lol) and she would just light up when she saw me and it was such a good feeling; she's really cute but somehow I was confident; mostly likely because she seemed so interested in talking to me. I thought about asking for her number but I didn't want my anxiety to show and I could never find any moment alone with her; I couldn't do it while other people are around; I am so self conscious about those things. I sort of decided that I'd just leave it alone because again I have long history of being rejected ( especially asking out girls I worked with) Once I found I was leaving this job; I realized I had nothing to lose but I tried not stress over it. If I could ask her; great; if not; then I'd be alright either way. Anyways as I was leaving for my shift; head down; very sad about leaving; I went back in to do some shopping; I then saw the girl I liked on her own; at the front door; looking at her phone. I decided in a split second right there that this was chance to ask for her number. I sort of nervously told her that if she had questions about writing ( stupid I know) that she could talk to me about it. I told her this was my last shift; she seemed happy about me asking for her number and told me to put my number on her phone and she'd text me. She then hugged me and wished me luck. I just felt so proud of myself at that moment; that I had the confidence to ask her and I wasn't too anxious. I went about it the right way and I realized that maybe I lost my job but I gained a possible opportunity to get to know this girl. I just tell myself to take it very slow and give myself a chance to catch my breath from all the stress; I'll text her soon and see what happens. When one doors closes another one opens. I think this is a new chapter in my life; a new year and good things are truly on the horizon. Thank you for all the support regarding the job; it really makes a difference 
 Thanks 
 Dave

 Hello, my name is Dave. I love to write, it is my passion, I try to be vulnerable and honest in all of my posts. I hope to use writing to make a difference in the lives of others and help myself in the process; this blog has been very therapeutic and I can't believe I never took the time to write in the " about me" section. I am not a professional writer but it would be a dream of mine to be published. Please take the time to read this blog and feel free to comment anytime.   View all posts by revolutionarymusings

 Oh boy I can relate to feeling rejections. I am pretty sure that job changes and losses (as well as moving, divorce, weddings, a death in the family) are on the list of major life stressors (for which we can expect to have a escalated stress levels, which can make us feel more anxious than usual ). So I think your approach is great. You arenâ€™t denying your feelings, you are working through them. Bravo for that. I would encourage you to be gentle with yourself and to keep doing what you are doing. I like how you are seeing all the positives in the job change. 
Yay to you for getting the girls number!! That did take a lot of courage!

 Hey there David, this is the most powerful piece of writing and also so painful. Thank you for sharing your real world of truths; it is definitely refreshing in an authentic way. I deeply appreciate you voice, experiences and I'm also sad you didn't get the permanent job. I'm sending you lots of support, though in this next chapter with volunteer, focusing on your education and also finding more time to go to church.

 Thank you for the sweet comment, friend. I really appreciate you stopping by my blog. I try to be as honest as I can in my writing; I think I am naturally honest person; which can be a good or bad thing depending on you talk to you. I am happy that a writer like you appreciates what I have to say; it means a whole lot and I appreciate your support but please don't be sad for me; I have faith things are going to work out. I am trying to stay positive and know that better opportunities will come my way. I hope 2019 is a great year for you, my friend. I hope to continue to see your writings and that you have happiness. Take care
