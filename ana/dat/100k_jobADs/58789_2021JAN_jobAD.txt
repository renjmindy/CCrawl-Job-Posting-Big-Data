 The 11 Most Life-Threatening Jobs on the Planet 
 Posted on November 5, 2012 by   Rod Rehm 
 Today's post comes from guest author Paul J. McAndrew, Jr. from Paul McAndrew Law Firm in Iowa. As written below, it is amazing what kinds of risks workers need to take to feed their families. And sadly in some places in the world, these are actually the jobs that pay better or are the only ones available for many workers. Notice that some of these risky jobs are in the United States, and truck driver is among those listed. Attorneys at Rehm, Bennett & Moore have represented many injured truckers, construction workers and agricultural workers. And it gives me pause to read about struggling workers throughout the world and in our own country whose lot and risk of injury could be improved through safety efforts. Take care. 
 Today 's post comes to us from our colleagues at insurancequotes.org. 
 The danger workers face on the job is not always compensated by higher pay. Life-threatening jobs can be mind-numbingly simple, easily performed by unskilled workers or children, or as physically and mentally demanding as one can imagine. Cable television shows like Deadliest Catch and Ice Road Truckers give some sense of the dangers faced by workers in the sea fishing and truck driving industries respectively, while films like  Workingman's Death  (2005) document examples of dangerous, and almost pointlessly unproductive manual labor. Below are 11 life-threatening jobs ranging from the banal to the bizarre.

 Street Sweeper (Rwanda) The most humble of jobs can be the most dangerous. On the streets of Kigali province, in the country of Rwanda, women dressed in blue work from dawn to dusk sweeping the roads and highways. Drivers, going several miles per hour, zoom past, their cars missing the street-sweeping women by just inches. The women wear no reflective clothing, and there are no cautionary signs or pylons alerting drivers of the presence of these women on the road. In a country with 30% unemployment, street sweeping, which pays approximately $3 a day, is a sought-after job. 
 King Crab Fisherman (Alaska, United States) 
More dramatic than street sweeping, crab fishing in the Bering Sea is one of the world's most dangerous professions. The fishing takes place night and day in rough waters that constantly and violently rock the boats, sending high waves crashing over the decks. Fishermen can slip on the soaked deck, get hit by flying objects, or fall overboard into freezing water. In the 1990s, the Alaskan fishing industry experienced 400 deaths per 100,000 employees. That number has increased since. 
 Sulfur Miner (East Java, Indonesia) Java's sulfur miners gather chunks of yellow sulfur located next to a steaming, acidic volcano crater lake. The men hold their breaths and run into the clouds of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide, gases that burn the eyes and throat, and grab as much sulfur as they can carry before returning to relative safety away from the lake. The miners gag, choke, and spit before repeating the process again and again. The sulfur they gather is used to bleach sugar, make matches, and vulcanize rubber. The miners are paid $10 to $15 a day, with some extra income coming from posing for photographs taken by curious tourists well away from the poisonous gas. Gloves and gas masks are unaffordable luxury items. 
 Police Office (Kabul, Afghanistan) 
As recently as December 2011, police officers and police stations in war-torn Kabul, Afghanistan,  have been targeted  by the Taliban soldiers and suicide bombers. CBS News reports that every day, five out of 10 Kabul police officers die on the job. Lack of training and high-tech tools, as well as government-level corruption and an economy based on the heroin trade, prevent Kabul's police force from performing their job with any degree of safety or effectiveness. 
 E-Waste Recycler (Guiyu, China) 
Old discarded electronics, including laptops, home entertainment systems, and smart phones, are exported to Guiyu's electronic waste sites to be gathered and broken down, by hand, for scrap metal by thousands of low-paid workers and their children. The electronics release toxic metals and chemicals into the workers and the environment, poisoning families and their environment. The amount of e-waste on the planet is increasing at an alarming rate, mostly in developing countries, with illegal exporting and dumping contributing to the glut of toxic electronics. 
 Truck Driver (United States) 
Driving a truck is one of the most dangerous jobs in the United States. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration reports that truck drivers are "more likely to die in a work-related accident than the average worker,"  Continue reading ->
