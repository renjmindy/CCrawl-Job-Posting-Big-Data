 Why is my job not accepted?

 Most of our jobs are matched within 30 minutes, however, there are certain factors of your briefing that can delay that. 
 Please ensure that your compensation and deadline are in line with our suggested rates and delivery time. Review your briefing and make sure that you aren't missing any details or documentation that would prevent someone external from working independently.
