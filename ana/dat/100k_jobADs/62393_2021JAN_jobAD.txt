 words written down  
 This blog is all about words because they matter, they influence, they entertain and when you put them down on a page in a meaningful order, they acquire permanence. Contained here is my writing over the past 10+ years, primarily book reviews and posts on magazine and web articles I liked and I'm currently aiming to read and write on two books a month.

 BusinessWeek Career/Business Pieces - Mar 15 issue 
 Some pretty interesting stuff from the Mar 15 issue of  BusinessWeek ... much of it around a common theme. 
 
 The first story that struck me as interesting was  "What I Learned from My Dad" ... a commentary by  Peter Buffett  following the much larger profile of his uber-investor father,  Warren Buffett . The piece is actually excerpted from his forthcoming book  "Life Is What You Make It: Find Your Own Path to Fulfillment"  and tells the interesting tale of how the younger Buffett was staked with a roughly $90K inheritance at age 21... and used the money to fund making a go of it in the music field he loved. 
 Immediately following that in this BW issue was  "And Google Begat..."  about the Angel investing (no, not  these kind of Angels ) done by current and former Googlers. Pretty interesting stuff about the "next generation" impact  Google  wealth is having by helping fund tech startups such as  Twitter  ,  Tesla Motors  and a host of smaller unknown (but, probably not always) ventures. The story was also noteworthy to me with mention of  Truckee, CA  based ex-Google guy  Chris Sacca  ( his blog here ). Granted, the town is what I noticed, but it was cool to read how Sacca came across one of his investments after posting a message on his  Twitter  account one Friday night asking if any startups were working late. 
 Finally, from this issue I liked  "The Road to Reinvention"  about career changes following personal setbacks. Specifically the one that got me (out of three vignettes) was that about  Todd Morris ... a 30 something tech sales guy who had an interest in a product category (security and surveillance gadgets), didn't see anyone dominating the field and up and created a now successful company,  BrickHouse Security ) in that space. Gotta be something to that idea of building a business around something you think valuable, but not already out there. 
 Three stories... one theme. Two guesses... that's right, building a career/investing in a business around something that interests you. Solid.

 Wherefore the blog? 
 Fascinating question. Well, I hope so since I both posed the question and am writing this thing. Simple answer is that the point is to write about writing I find... well, interesting. 
 Result of the work is a repository of information about some great writing along with my thoughts on the writing as a portfolio of sorts and indicator of what things important or at least interesting to me.
