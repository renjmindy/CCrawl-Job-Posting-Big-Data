 Hi! I am currently working in Saudi Arabia as a Secretary. Before I left Philippines I had a planned to study caregiving course since I am interested to take care of those people that needs my assistance,however, I couldn't support my studies financially on that time. On the end of this year I am due to end my contract earning enough money to study caregiving course to pursue my dream. In this regard, I am requesting your assistance if you can recommend me a caregiving school and agency affiliated with you. 
 Thanks.

 Ms. Aquino, 
 I think that the best caregiving course that you can attend is the one being offered by TESDA because the graduates of TESDA's caregiving course are the one being sought by caregiver recruitment agencies.
