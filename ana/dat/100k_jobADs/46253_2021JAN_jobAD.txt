 Gibson to Begin Construction of ROCKSINO CASINO ASAP. Garmong Construction expected to get the construction Job. 
 Terre Haute ROCKSINO waiting for final Rubber Stamp 
 Rocksino Is On the Way. Awaiting final approval from Indiana Gaming Commission. 
 The $100 million dollar Casino will be built next to the Home2Suites on 22 acres. This property is just South of Walmart on SR46. 
 The plans include a 300 seat lounge club called "The Velvet", a HardRock Cafe, buffet, several bars, and lots of gambling. The casino will also be smoke free due to an iron clad city/county smoke free ordinance. This will be Indiana's first smoke free casino thanks to Terre Haute's 2007 efforts to keep residents healthy. All grandfathered exemptions expired in 2012. 
 Similar designs were featured at the Rocksino outside of Cleveland OH. That Rocksino has been sold and will be rebranded under MGM. It originally opened in 2013 
 The construction of the Terre Haute's Casino is expected to be done by Garmong Construction Services. 
 Garmong is building the Terre Haute Convention Center and has 2 employees on the Terre Haute Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors. 
 Once construction is completed, the Terre Haute Casino is expected to provide several hundred jobs. 
 Part of the Local Development Agreement between the Casino operator and Terre Haute would allow additional State Mandated Casino Funds to flow into the casino's controlled Vigo County Community Improvement Foundation. This newly created entity will benefit projects that are consistent with the Chamber of Commerce See You In Terre Haute 2025 plan.
