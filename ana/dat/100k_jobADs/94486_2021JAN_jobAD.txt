 Recently Unemployed 
 Being unemployed is temporary and is the perfect time to network and retool for your next career. People who use our services find employment faster than those who go it alone. The workplace is constantly changing and how you search for a job is constantly evolving. Workforce Partnership is here to supply you new tools to help reach your career goals. When visiting with us share whether you were laid off, or if your job was sent overseas, as situations like this may qualify you for additional services. Anyone can use our offices and receive basic career services. However, some programs and funding are reserved for residents of Johnson, Leavenworth and Wyandotte Counties, with low to moderate income and particular barriers to employment. Visit any one of our Workforce Centers; our dedicated staff is here to assist you in finding gainful, meaningful employment. All at no cost to you.
