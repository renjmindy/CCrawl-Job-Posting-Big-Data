 What is a roofer? 
 Roofers build and maintain roofs. They install materials, such as cement and clay, and repair damaged parts to ensure safety. They may specialize in residential or industrial roofing. 
 What do roofers do? 
 Roofers construct and fix roofs using hand tools and other equipment (e.g. scaffolds). They ensure roofs are stable and waterproof. They also install insulation systems and vapor barriers. 
 Overall, roofer duties include: 
 
 Building and repairing roofs 
 Choosing tiles, wood shingles and other necessary roofing materials 
 Ensuring roofing projects are delivered on time 
 
 What skills do you need to be a roofer? 
 Depending on the scope and location of the project, roofers can either hold a roofing apprenticeship or a relevant license, or be an individual contractor. Some also learn this job onsite with appropriate training from specialists. Roofing job responsibilities may include knowledge of materials and tactics required for roof work. 
 The position also requires stamina and balance as roofers often work at heights while operating various machinery and equipment. Roofers are also detail-oriented, with the ability to multitask. 
 When creating your own roofer job description, make sure to add these skills as requirements and modify them based on your needs.
