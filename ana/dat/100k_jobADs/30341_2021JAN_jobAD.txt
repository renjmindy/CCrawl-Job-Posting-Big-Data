 FOR A WORLD OF UNDERSTANDING 
 “What The World Needs Now” 
 
 This song has been a classic for many years. 
 It's timeless. 
 The message it conveys can be applied to any era in history. 
 So much more to our current times. 
 The people, the countries, the nations, the world. 
 We ALL need love!

 Hyatt Hotels Runs UNBELIEVABLE Anti-Trump Ad At The Oscars 
 WRITTEN BY TRUTH EXAMINER 
 
 Hyatt Hotels aired a new spot during the Oscars, titled “  For a World of Understanding  ” featuring travelers in locations including Thailand, Morocco and Spain. 
 
 Ad Week  says that the ad campaign aims to highlight small moments of understanding, such as when a woman on a train notifies another woman that her head scarf has fallen off.

 PORTRAIT OF CHAOS 
 Time’s new cover is going to royally piss off Drumpf 
 When Drumpf was named Time Magazine’s ‘  person of the year  ’, he used it as an opportunity to gloat. 
 
 The irony, of course, was that being ‘person of the year’ is not necessarily a compliment, and upon further inspection, even the cover photo held clues that Drumpf’s impending presidency was doomed. 
 
 Well, there’s no way Drumpf can spin Time’s latest cover as anything except what it is: 
 a mirror held up to his disastrous first month as leader of the country. 
 This is what will hit news stands on Feb. 27.

 To start the day …. “Carrot Crazy …. All for Naught, after all"!!

 LOVE THE IRONY OF LIFE 
 Two hunters but only one rabbit, which will win? 
 If the carrot crazy rabbit is anything to go by it will be the one who can offer him the biggest carrot! Or perhaps not - no spoilers, but you need to watch this to the end. 
 This very funny animated short draws on the history of the genre, with shades of Loony Tunes from the past all the way up to Wallace and Grommit today. 
 That is not to say it is derivative – this tale of greed and vulnerability is very much twenty first century and bodes well in terms of what its two young animators may produce in the future. 
 Talking of whom, this is the senior thesis at the Ringling College of Art and Design by Dylan VanWormer and Logan Scelina. 
 Well done chaps!

 HAPPY SWITCH-UP NIGHT 
 
 The competition is heating up. 
 Last night was almost perfect. 
 The switch up proved to be the needed push for most competitors to step up their game. 
 You may know I am very partial to Bindi Irwin. 
 Alexa and Derek received the first perfect score of this season. 
 They did a great job. 
 Honor where honor is due. 
 You be the judge.

 It was the nuttiest week of the  Dancing with the Stars  season as all of the stars traded partners for one night of total insanity. Or at least that's how it usually is. 
 Last night, October 12, 2015, was actually great, and a lot less of a mess up than the switch-up often is. There were some truly incredible dances tonight, including the  season 's first perfect score  from a slightly unexpected pair! 
 While both  Bindi Irwin  and Carlos  PenaVega  totally rocked their routines with respective temporary partners Val Chmerkovskiy and Lindsay Arnold, it was  Alexa PenaVega  and  Derek Hough  who blew the roof off the place with their epic tango and scored a standing ovation from Carrie Ann Inaba (even if she thought it was a paso doble) and perfect tens from all four judges, including guest judge  Maksim Chmerkovskiy .

 Horty 
 I'm originally from Puerto Rico. I was born in Santurce and raised in Rio Piedras. I currently live in Florida - since 1999. I have a doctorate degree in Medicine; completed in 1976. My Internal Medicine specialty was completed in 1979. Worked for Puerto Rico's health system until 1985. At this time, I'm happily retired after working for the federal government for almost 28yrs. I also worked for the government of Puerto Rico from 1979 through 1985 .... for a total of almost 40 years as a physician. I want to offer any knowledge that I have to anyone "out there" who is interested. My views are liberal in almost every sense. My knowledge is "eclectic" - a bit of everything. Music and reading are my passion. Blogging has also become a very interesting endeavor. Metaphysical topics attract me. I'm interested in news - reporting human issues like injustice, discrimination and abuse - the "wrongly" affected. My intention is to bring this knowledge to an understandable level and to help anyone in need. I'm open to questions and will answer them to the best of my ability. Currently working on an enterprise whose main mission will be to bring peoples of all walks of life together. To be one .... since we ALL are ONE!! The future looks bright and promising!!!
