  Unemployment: 3 Critical Job Search Tips

 When you are unemployed and looking for work, a job search can feel even more pressured-filled. The lack of income and feelings of insecurity make it hard to stay positive and focused on the goal of getting hired. We lack confidence. However, it doesn't have to be that way! 
 
 **You're not unemployed, you're "between jobs"  and looking for your next career opportunity. **Following these three critical job search tips will help seize this new opportunity. 
 Avoid Negative People At All Costs 
 Support groups seem great in theory, but are often ineffective in practice. Be selective to which events you attend and be mindful of the company you keep. If you aren't leaving the events feeling happy and energized, then you shouldn't go anymore. 
 When looking for work, mindset is everything. It can be hard to stay positive. There's no need to make it harder on yourself by spending time with people that make your feel worse. 
 The same applies for friends and family who put you down or make you feel bad about your employment situation.  Stay clear of anyone who can't help you remain positive! 
 Get Extremely Clear On How You Are The "Aspirin" To An Employer's "Pain" 
 Getting hired is all about showing an employer how you can save and/or make them enough money to justify hiring you. You must be very compelling. You do that by proving to them that you will alleviate some major pain. 
 Focus in on the problems companies in your industry are experiencing and initiate dialogue with as many professionals in your field as you can to discuss this problem and how you solve it. 
 You must brand yourself  as a specialist who can add value—a.k.a. be the aspirin to an employer's pain . Otherwise, you'll find your job search stalling from a lack of focus on your part, and a lack of interest on the part of the employers. 
 Always Be Proactive 
 Applying to endless jobs online is the most ineffective job search tactic and unemployed person can use. You will often be screened out automatically for not currently working. Is it fair? No. But, it's reality. 
 The solution is to meet people and industry events and proactively ask people to set up informational interviews. 
 You must connect with people directly and have meaningful conversations with them, in order to get people to pay attention to you. That way, you can circumvent the online application process and get referred to jobs directly. 
 This is the single best way an unemployed person can remove the stigma that comes with their employment status.  If you get referred by someone, the fact that you aren't working becomes less important. So, get out there and connect.

 Being out of work is challenging, but it doesn't mean you can't find work. It does mean you need to ramp up your efforts and pay close attention to how you are conducting your  job search.  Follow the tips above and they should help improve the chances of you getting interviews.
