 Thanks to our friend  Wim Pullen  at TU Delft for bringing this report to our attention. It is essential reading for any professional with an interest in work, employment, and how it is changing around the world. 
 You, like us, probably specialize in thinking about work vis-a-vis place; or workplaces, and the many combinations or work and place. But, how much do we consider the fundamental changes happening in the world of 'work' itself? 
 In the key findings, the report says  " Only one quarter of workers worldwide is estimated to have a stable employment relationship, according to a new report by the International Labour Organization (ILO)" . That is a shocking statistic. Some will argue, a lack of a "stable" employment relationship is better than no work at all. We are not here to argue the point. But, just to consider the small world in which we (and probably you) as "workplace strategists" actually live and work. 
 In context, my recent blog " It's five o'clock somewhere " seems like a small, privileged world. As does most of the other musing around work-life balance, flexible working, and finding hours of work that "suit" people. It is worth remembering, that we are all in a fortunate minority. 
 Just saying….. 
 Take care, Paul  @paulcarder
