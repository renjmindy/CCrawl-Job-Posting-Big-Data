 Build subscription website 
 Published: Last month  Bids: 6 
 Hello, 
 I am looking for a web developer who can make/clone a website to create the same functionality as  onlyfans.com.  This is a website where people pay a subscription to see their favourite influencers content and the influencers are then paid by us. The influencers will be able to see instantly if someone has subscribed to them. 
 Experience in LARAVEL, bootstrap etc or similar is desired. It needs to have the capabilities so fans can sign up, pay premium for special content from their favourite influencer etc. The influencers will be able to add their twitter accounts to their profile and boomerang profile photo and be able to upload content such as photos, video's and music files to their profile. 
 Essential: 
- Must have front-end and back-end developer skills to add all functionality to the website i.e API payment integration, video, photo files - I am not looking for a design only. 
 - Must have experience in framework, clean coding, PHP, etc 
 - I am looking for someone who has time for the job and doesn't see it as a challenge. 
 - Experienced in logo design (desired but not essential) 
 *I have bought domain and hosting already. 
 I am looking for someone who can make the site user friendly in the backend so removing or adding profiles, editing is easy. 
 Also being able to see information on each profile such as how much each influencer has earned etc is easy to see and user friendly. 
 The website has to be social with emoji's easily attachable to profiles and other twitter handles. (When you check out the example websites you will see all the capabilities/functions that need to be added.) 
 I will edit general footer information myself such as terms and conditions, privacy page. 
 1. How long it will take you to make the website? 
 2. Are you ready to instantly start the project? 
 3. Do you have examples of a website you have made similar or with similar functionalities please add the link in your response? 
 
 
 
 What you will be using to make the website? 
 5. How much will this cost? 
 I look forward to hearing from you
