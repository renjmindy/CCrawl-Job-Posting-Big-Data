 Civil Service Fast Stream - Insider Event -> 
 Careers in Consulting 
 Posted on  March 14, 2016  by  researchstudentcareers 
 PhD graduates are often looking for a career that combines using their skills in problem solving, research and analysis, writing, and more; where they will be challenged; and where the work is project based and varied. Consulting is one area where these criteria can be met, although it's obviously very different from a career in academic research. If you're interested in finding out more, come along to the  Insider Insight event on Consulting Careers on 16th March (3.30pm - 5.30pm). 
 Consulting careers cover a range of different roles and consultants work with a diverse mix of industries. So, what does a Career in Consulting typically involve? What differentiates Strategy Consulting from Management Consulting? How do you get into these roles? 
 At this event you'll hear 4 speakers working in different areas of consulting talk about their jobs and what they think you need to succeed. You'll get an insight into the qualities you need to work in this area and ideas on ways you can build up relevant skills and experience. 
 Format:  Short presentations from representatives of 4 Consulting Firms, followed by Q&A, with time for soft drinks & networking afterwards. 
 Speakers: 
 
 Tom Redpath  : Tom graduated from Edinburgh in 2012 with a 2:1 in Economics and Accounting and currently works as a Consultant at OC&C in London. 
 Speaker tbc  from PA Consulting 
 James Surgeon  : James works as at Technology Management Consultant in Accenture's Edinburgh Office. 
 Natalie McGuigan:  Natalie graduated from Edinburgh in 2013 with an MA (Hons) 2:1 in History. She undertook an internship with FTI Consulting before commencing her current position as a Consultant in their Strategic Communications Dept in Sep 2015.
