 Grand Kids Learning Center's Mission is: To provide high quality early learning for children, ages 8 weeks through 6 years, that encourages growth and exploration through cognitive, language, physical, and social/emotional development in a safe and nurturing environment. 
 Grand Kids Learning Center's (GKLC) philosophy is: GKLC provides high quality care and early education for all our students. We respect children as individuals and strive to meet them where they are developmentally and encourage growth that will take them to their next milestone.
