 We are currently looking for a fluent Arabic speaking co-founder to join our mission-driven startup. An insipiring individual with substantial CTO or Product Management experience in the startup world, who can not only add value to the company, but also shares an obsessive desire to serve the community and build tools that can offer happier and healthier lives for the Arabic speaking population. 
 NŪR is the only mindfulness and meditation platform that caters to the Arabic speaking population with a tailored and local twist to make it relevant for the region. 
 Our mission is to enable the Arab world to  discover  ,  understand  and  benefit  from the healing processes of meditation and mental health practices. In the context of the ongoing Covid-19 global climate, we can be even more focused on helping reduce anxiety and stress levels, and offer tools to encourage happier and healthier lives. 
 The role will be based in Dubai for 4/5 months out of the year to make sure we nurture the importance of human connection between us. For the rest of the year, you have the option to work remotely from anywhere you desire. 
 This journey comes with a starting salary of €60-70k and substantial shares. If you are looking for a mission-driven, social impact project that will seek to change the daily lives one step at a time of millions of people, please ping me and we'll explore if this journey is destined for us to take together.
