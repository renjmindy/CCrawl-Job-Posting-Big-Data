  Best Flex Jobs For Busy Mothers (And Fathers!)  
 Aaron Sanborn 
 September 30, 2019 
 Whether you're in between jobs or a stay-at-home parent, flexibility can sometimes be a major factor when looking for the next career opportunity. 
 Flexjobs  recently released a list of the most flexible work-from-home jobs. These jobs allow many stay-at-home parents to work remotely while the kids are in school, or on their own terms. Here are five of the most popular work-from-home flex jobs. 
 
 Writer/Blogger

 Blogging is extremely popular and it seems that everyone is doing it. From publications, corporations, retailers, or health care agencies, any business or entity with a website, can easily have a blog. 
 If you enjoy writing, or delving into niche subjects, then blogging may be a flex job worth looking into.  Another major benefit to blogging is that you can write from anywhere!  If you need to get a blog done on the run, you're not limited to the home office. 
 Depending on the gig, some bloggers can make up to $50,000. 
 Proofreader 
 Like writing, proofreading can be done from anywhere. At home, a coffee shop, or the park. However, because the job requires an incredible attention to detail, you wouldn't want too many distractions while on the job. 
 This type of job isn't for everyone.  You'll need strong grammar skills as well as the ability to quickly spot errors and fact check. But, if you enjoy that type of work, it offers a lot of flexibility. Proofreaders can sometimes make $40,000 or more. 
 Recruiting Coordinator 
 Human resources is a hectic profession and many HR offices now offer flexible recruiting coordinator positions to help with tasks like looking over resumes, performing background checks, and assisting with interviews. 
 Almost every type of operation has an HR office, so there should be a diverse amount of positions available. Recruiting coordinator positions can average over $45,000. 
 Data Entry Specialist

 If you have exceptional typing skills, then being a data entry specialist may be the right opportunity for you. This position is particularly popular for stay-at-home parents because it allows them to work remotely while the kids are at school. Data entry specialist is the type of position that requires you to put your head down and grind away without distraction, so it's important to have a quiet space. 
 The job typically has minimum education requirements and sometimes turns into more permanent or different positions with companies. On average, data entry specialists can make up to $35,000. 
 Customer Service Representative 
 Customer service representative is another position where there are a diverse amount of opportunities available.  It's a position that requires patience (something most parents have practice with)  and a quiet home office (perfect for when the kids are at school). 
 The job requires taking phone calls, responding to inquiries and providing customer assistance. Some of the  companies that hire stay-at-home customer service representatives  include Amazon, American Express, Apple, and U-Haul. These roles typically require a high school diploma and willingness to learn new technology and software programs. Customer service representatives make up to $37,000. 
 Other stay-at-home jobs that made  flexjob's list  include transcriptionist, virtual assistant, online teacher/tutor, accounting clerk, graphic designer, health coach, marketing specialist, social media specialist, travel consultant and web designer. In addition to providing flexibility to stay-at-home parents or those in a career transition, these flex jobs also give employees the freedom to test out potential career interests. 
 Depending on an individual's situation, flex jobs can sometimes lead to a more permanent or prominent role with a company. On the flip side, a person may decide after working a flex job that they no longer want to pursue a particular career. 
 Whether you're looking for a stay-at-home flex job or something more permanent,  Work It Daily  can help! Join our  exciting new platform  today and network with other like-minded professionals while having access to video tutorials and one-on-one coaching.
