 CAREERS 
 WHY BE A WORDWRITER? 
 WordWrite’s own story is filled with great characters — WordWriters. That title can mean a lot of different things, but no matter if their expertise falls into traditional public relations, creative content generation, digital marketing or, like many, a mix of it all, WordWriters have distinctive skillsets that contribute to an agency unlike any other. 
 Join us, and you’re part of a group that cares about you and your career. We believe  in  , expect the most  from  and want the best  for  each other. 
 __ 
 WORK + PLAY 
 When you love what you do, a job is more than a paycheck. Our office atmosphere balances hard work and fun, and we offer modern perks such as a free gym and team outings. 
 __ 
 TRANSPARENCY 
 When you’re with us, you’re in the know on how we’re doing as a company, where we’re heading and our long-term aspirations. And if you’re unsure, just ask. 
 __ 
 TEAM-BUILDING 
 When we say we have a “team atmosphere,” we live it by encouraging collaboration in the office and bonding outside of it, with happy hours, volunteering projects, events and more. 
 __ 
 BEYOND YOUR SALARY 
 Not only do we offer competitive compensation, we have a personalized bonus program. And since we know there’s life after WordWrite, we offer 401(k) matching and retirement plan options.

 FREE SNACKS, SHARP MINDS 
 No vending machines here. Just a constantly replenished basket of healthy snacks, fruit, a smattering of free lunches — and coffee,  lots  of coffee.
