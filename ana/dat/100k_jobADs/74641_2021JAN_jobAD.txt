 When I review and read a business book, I tend to compartmentalize it for content, approach, flow and conclusion. In this book, the author has generally done a solid job of planning, relating and summarizing the intent and value to be found in the work. 
 Overall, I believe this is a solid reference for someone who is new to selling, regardless of age. It has substance for those in career change situations, as well as those just entering the field from college. Hoxie asserts throughout the book that being a professional and successful sales professional is an ongoing commitment to building rapport, honest customer relationships and follow through. 
 The book is broken into 15 main topics areas 
1. Sales basics 
2. Initial prospecting 
3. Initial sales meetings 
4. Presentations, solutions 
5. Closing 
6. Objections 
7. Goal setting 
8. Continual prospecting 
9. Industry specifics 
10. The life of a salesperson 
11. Sales management 
12. Retail sales 
13. Your 90 day plan 
14. Beyond 90 days 
15. Thirty three AST (I will not give the abbreviations away, but they are right on) 
 Hoxie properly opines that not all sales jobs are worth taking and that are clear benefits and downsides in selling. Each chapter covers a particular topic and offers suggestions and ideas. I do not totally understand the sequence of certain chapters, but that is the author's perspective. It did seem the title of the book (90 day plan) would be introduced before the next to last chapter, but it does share some good concepts. 
 This book is very detailed and structured and I believe most readers will appreciate the easy to follow case studies and the pros and cons that are included along the way. The action steps offered are also a positive addition to this kind of book, as they could help guide readers in a week by week channel of activities. 
 The chapter on objection handling with specific phrases ("I'm on a budget," "I need to ask….," or "Can't you do better on price" etc.) is an excellent practice field for almost anyone , with are scripted answers that could help the novice or uncertain person. 
 There are industry specific Q&A's on selling advertising, real estate, services and different kinds of products. Hoxie highlights the common error in sales and marketing of focusing too much time and money on new potential clients, rather than appreciating the existing base. 
 I recommend this as A Solid Work for Those New to Sales
