 Our Manifesto:  ‍ 
 Video games are a unique medium with a distinct cultural voice, but for too long the leading stories have alternated between labor abuse of dev teams, obscene executive pay, and culturally homogenous studios. 
 If we believe that video games can be art, team diversity has value, and investment in labor pays future dividends: then we need to manifest that change at the studio level. 
 The Beauty Cult pledges to be a worker-centric studio, to invest in equity initiatives as a local, studio and industry level, and to always make interesting games that push the boundaries of art in video games. 
 We strive to explore the bleeding edge of what video games can be.
