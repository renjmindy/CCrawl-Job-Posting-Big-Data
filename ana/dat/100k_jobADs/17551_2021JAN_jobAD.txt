  Job Networking: 4 Types of People You Must Know  
 J.T. O'Donnell 
 March 15, 2011 
 When I work with young professionals, one of the most common frustrations I hear is: 
 _  â€œI don't know who to network with." _ 
 Ironically, I find even seasoned professionals don't really understand who they should be connecting with and why. 
 Join me for a webinar that will teach you the 4 types of contacts you need to identify and  begin networking  with for professional success. 
 If you've ever wished for a simple way to ensure you are talking with the right people, then this presentation is for you! 
 _  Sorry, this event already happened. But you're in luck, we've embedded the recorded version below. Enjoy! _ 
 _  J.T. O'Donnell is the founder of CAREEREALISM.com and CEO of CareerHMO.com, a web-based career development company. _
