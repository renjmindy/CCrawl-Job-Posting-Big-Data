 Put power back into the hands of audio content creators 
 Role overview 
 Who are we? 
 Audius  is a digital streaming service that connects fans directly with artists and exclusive new music. 
 It does this by being fully decentralized: Audius is owned and run by a vibrant, open-source community of artists, fans, and developers all around the world. Audius gives artists the power to share never-before-heard music and monetize streams directly. Developers can build their own apps on top of Audius, giving them access to one of the most unique audio catalogs in existence. 
 Backed by an all-star team of  investors , Audius was founded in 2018 and serves over 250,000 users every month, making it the largest non-financial crypto application ever built. 
 Who we are looking for? 
 We are looking for talented engineers to help us design, build, and architect the most difficult parts of the  Audius protocol  (high availability services for decentralized replication of data, latency-sensitive distributed file transfers, Ethereum smart contracts, infrastructure and tooling for third parties to run our open source services). You are a collaborative engineer who enjoys working with a small team to solve big problems that need innovative solutions. Youâ€™re eager to jump into multiple parts of our tech stack and have strong CS fundamentals to do so. We solve a lot of problems that can't be easily Googled or searched on StackOverflow. 
 Our Company 
 Audius is a 13-person team of entrepreneurs, engineers, audiophiles, and blockchain experts. Our benefits include unlimited PTO, high quality paid medical insurance, FSA, 401k, yearly learning stipend, equipment stipend and a home office setup credit. We also have a monthly concert credit (COVID-19 permitting). 
 Our company is fully remote forever and our team is currently distributed across the United States. We are also open to international hires. 
 Key Responsibilities 
 
 Help design, architect, build, deploy and maintain services in the Audius protocol 
 Assume ownership of features end to end through release 
 Although you'll primarily be focused on distributed systems problems, you'll also be working on things as broad as database replication and sharding, cryptography and scalable decentralized infrastructure 
 Promote sound engineering practices and champion best practices for testing, tooling and incident response 
 Perform thoughtful architecture and code reviews 
 
 Skills and Experience 
 
 Experience architecting, implementing and maintaining distributed, high-volume services in production 
 Deeply knowledgable about distributed systems, system design and algorithms 
 Extensive experience with a modern programming language (Javascript, Python preferred), shell scripting and strong Linux fundamentals 
 Great interpersonal and communication skills and comfort working within a small team 
 Track record of working through technical obstacles and solving complex challenges with minimal guidance and experience helping mentor other engineers to achieve the same 
 
 Bonus Points 
 
 Knowledge in our tech stack: Javacript (nodejs), Python, Postgres, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes 
 Previous experience with Blockchain development (Solidity, Ganache, Truffle, WASM, Rust) 
 Passionate about music
