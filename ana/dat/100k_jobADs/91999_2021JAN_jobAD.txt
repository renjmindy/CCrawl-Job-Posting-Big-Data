 Prayer Request - I Lost my Job 
 
 Prayer Request - I Lost my Job 
 by Brian Carl 
(Kipnuk, Alaska USA) 
 
 my son 
 I lost my job back in July and there is no other way for me to support my to children. For the past 2 months, I've been borrowing money from my grandparents. Borrowing money from them makes me feel bad. And now, I'm running behind on bills, receiving threatening calls from bank. I have no money to support my 2 year old son and 1 year old daughter. Please, I'm in need of help!

 Dear Brian Carl...I pray first of all for PEACE in your being to clear the way for you to receive guidance....I pray for wisdom and clarity to come forth to guide you to where you are to be next and what to be doing to take care of yourself and your children...in gratitude we lift up the grandparents who have assisted out of love as best that they can....we give this to God to figure out and provide answers that will fill our hearts with love for the life that sustains us....blessings to YOU and your sweet children, your grandparents....as I was recently reminded...be open and flexible about what comes forth and presents itself for sustainable work...ask and be open to receive the answer for your highest good and that of your children...and may you KNOW without a doubt that the job that comes forth is meant for you...blessings of love.
