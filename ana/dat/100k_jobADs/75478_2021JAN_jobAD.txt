 Artist Countdown: Ratt Top 25 Tracks 8pm ET @RadioMax @theRATTpack 
 ](https://radiomaxmusic2.wordpress.com/2013/07/02/artist-countdown-ratt-top-25-tracks-8pm-et-radiomax-therattpack/) 
 Ratt is an American heavy metal band  that had significant commercial success in the 1980s. The band is best known for songs such as "Round and Round," "Wanted Man," and "Lay It Down". Ratt has been recognized as instrumental in the formation of the early 1980s Los Angeles hard rock and glam metal scene. 
 The band continues to tour and record today despite extended hiatuses and lineup changes. They released their latest studio album, Infestation, on April 20, 2010 and are currently working on their next studio album. 
 Ratt 's music is influenced by 1970s hard rock and heavy metal bands such as Aerosmith, Sweet,  Van Halen ,  Led Zeppelin , Rolling Stones,  Black Sabbath , Scorpions and KISS. They fused this style with  NWOBHM  influences, including  Iron Maiden  and  Judas Priest . 
 Although they later incorporated more of a blues-rock sound into their music, the band was one of the first glam metal style groups that appeared in the early 1980s in California. Their image bore similarities to that of Rough Cutt , which had several members who were previously in  Mickey Ratt  (from which Ratt evolved). (Source: Wikipedia)
