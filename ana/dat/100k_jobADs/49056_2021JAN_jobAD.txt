 Still Looking For A Job, Found This 
 Posted by  Scorpion Sting  on  October 8, 2014 
 Okay, I will be the first one to say being unemployed really hugs a root. As well, the job hunting process blows pretty hard to say the very least, especially because I'm seeking federal employment so I can apply my years of military service towards retirement. I'm beginning to wonder if having a bachelors degree, the disabled veterans preference, top secret clearance, fast and accurate typing skills, and other qualifications is enough. Where I suffer the most is lack of management skills, sales skills, and customer service skills. Because one or more of these skills is what has been biting me in the ass as I seek federal employment. Yesterday, I received my 14th letter of declination. But, this morning, I had an email giving a link to the following job announcement which I applied for. This one took 72 minutes to complete with all of the questionnaires, surveys, and background information. Anyway, just wanted to share how these official announcements look, because sometimes they are quite complicated. I think my wife and I have had quite enough background checks, I assure everyone we are legal US citizens with no international ties to ANYTHING OR ANYBODY.
