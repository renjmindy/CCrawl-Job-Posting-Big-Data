 Highest Paying Jobs | High Salary and Income | Job Descriptions 
 These figures come from the latest reports from the Bureau Labor Statistics, which is an agency of the US Department of Labor mandated to track employment data. Below is a table of the Top 10 Highest Paying Jobs in America. There is also a short job description for each job. 
 You may not be surprise to know that all of the Top 10 jobs are medical professions except for one, CEO. In fact, a majority of even the top 20 jobs are in the health care field. This is still a growing sector and the average income will continue to rise. You may also be surprised to see that CEO is not the highest paying job on the list. 
 Following the Top 10 is another table showing the  Top 10 Non-Medical Jobs  that are not in the health care industry. Most of those professions are in technical, business, and finance.

 Income and earning potential for careers in the health care industry is poised to rise due to the new reform measures. It is one of the few sectors that have grown over time and during severe economic drought. Look for this trend to continue. 
 If you want the highest paying jobs without a degree, you should look into sales jobs. Most of the other careers that you see on the list above require a college degree and advanced degrees. Most of them also require specialized training on top of that.

 Dream Jobs: Six-Figure Salaries and a Bright Future 
 Seemingly every week, another publication or website comes out with its list of the "Best Jobs of the Year" or the "Hottest Careers," purporting to show the best fields to get into for job stability and earnings potential. The problem with many of these lists is that the jobs and careers on them often require years and years of training (see: biomedical engineer), offer an extremely small overall pool of jobs (see:  meteorologist ), or really don't pay all that well (see: home health aide). 
 
 So we've put together a list of jobs that suffer from none of these disadvantages. Using statistics from the Bureau of Labor, salary sites, professional trade groups, and recruiters, we identified jobs that don't require more than two years of additional training to secure a position, have a reasonably large and growing number of overall jobs, and offer six-figure salaries to top earners in the field (generally, the top 10 percent of those employed). These, to our mind, are the true dream jobs. 
 
 Online Marketing Director 
 Salary for top earners:  $100,000+ 
 Projected job growth:  60 percent this year 
 Additional training required:  Familiarity with web analytics and search engine optimization and marketing can be acquired over several months via webinars, workshops, and online courses. A combination of marketing experience and online tech savvy, however, can help get your foot in the door. 
 As an online marketing director, you'd be developing and managing a company's social media strategy, website, online and email campaigns, and ecommerce and merchandising. "The field is exploding and you don't need an M.B.A.," says Ellen Pack, vice president of marketing for  Elance.com , which places online talent. According to Daniel Greenberg, chief marketing officer for job search engine SimplyHired.com, the number of listings for online marketing directors has increased more than 250 percent since June 2009. 
 
 Mobile Applications Developer 
 Salary for top earners:  $115,000 
 Projected job growth:  131 percent this year alone 
 Additional training required:  Programming experience in mobile platforms is necessary, but depending on your background, you can fine-tune your knowledge with a  DIY approach  or perhaps an  online certificate program  that typically takes one year to complete. 
 Developing and building applications for smartphones, iPads, and other tablets and notebook PCs is one of the most in-demand jobs in the world right now. So enticing is the revenue from mobile apps -- Gartner estimates that worldwide revenue could top $15 billion this year that Google recently announced it's  hiring dozens of mobile developers  in an attempt to counter Apple. Reality check: This isn't a field for dilettantes: it requires serious programming and IT skills, but the growth potential is huge. 
 
 Global Supply Chain Manager 
 Salary for top earners:  $135,100 
 Projected job growth:  10 percent by 2012 
 Additional training required:  Transitioning into this field could take between six months for  courses  and up to two years to get a  master's degree . Those with operations, purchasing, or logistics education and/or experience have the best chance of getting into this field. 
 Global supply chain managers are the unsung heroes of companies who have to get products from A to B, on time, and on budget and now across continents and time zones as well. The job calls for calm problem-solving ability, high-tech handiness, and diplomatic skill a triple threat that's hard to find. According to industry analysts, there is a  growing shortage  of these specialists as companies streamline and speed up every link in the chain to stay competitive. 
 
 Financial Advisor 
 Salary for top earners:  $139,350 
 Projected job growth:  30 percent by 2018 
 Additional training required:  While not required, the  Certified Financial Planner  (CFP) certificate is a useful credential to get into this profession. The coursework and exam can usually be completed in 18 to 24 months, and over 250 institutions across the country, including some that are online, offer  CFP-approved programs . 
 Once solely the purview of the wealthy, getting financial planning is now viewed as a prudent move for much of the population, particularly as traditional pensions fade. Consider that never before in history have regular people been required to take on this much responsibility for investing their nest eggs. You'll be helping clients build portfolios, save for college or a house, and do estate planning, either at a firm or for yourself. 
 
 Financial Analyst, Gaming Industry 
 Salary for top earners:  $100,000 
 Projected job growth:  20 percent by 2018 
 Additional training required:  Seminars, webinars, and online classes offered through the  International Gaming Institute  at the University of Nevada Las Vegas will bring you up to speed. The five core courses could be completed within two years, less time if you double up. 
 There are currently 943 casinos in 38 states across the country, and more are being built every day. And with their focus on efficiency and profitability, gaming companies need qualified financial analysts. In particular, new racetrack casinos, or 'racinos,' are starting to flourish and hire, says Beth Deighan, CEO of  Casino Careers LLC , an executive search firm. Skills from arenas such as government and finance are often transferable, Deighan says.

 8 Jobs with High Average Starting Salaries 
 In many careers, you start at the bottom rung and work for peanuts, in hopes of slowly moving up to a real paycheck. But some occupations skip the suffering and you earn a solid average starting salary on day one. 
 Jobs that pay well immediately can be found in a wide range of industries. Some require extensive education, some almost none. Here's a look at a variety of jobs where you can earn well from the start: 
 Prosthodontist  ($90,507). Installing fake teeth is one of the top-earning jobs in the first year of work, says career expert Laurence Shatkin, author of 250 Best-Paying Jobs. Four years at dental school plus additional advanced dental training are required, the Bureau of Labor Statistics notes. 
 Education administrators (elementary and secondary school)  ($63,249). Who knew managing the schoolyard could pay such a high starting salary? Most administrators have been teachers, and position themselves to move up by earning a master's or Ph.D. degree, Shatkin says. 
 Financial managers  ($53,071). Financial managers handle companies' toughest problems, Shatkin says – paying back loans, preparing financial statements, developing cash-management plans, and advising on investment of company cash. The BLS notes about one-third of financial managers work in the insurance or financial industries. 
 Detectives and Criminal Investigators  ($48,158). Law-and-order types may find this job appealing. The BLS says many get into the field from a related occupation such as correctional officer or beat cop. Advances in technology have made this career more interesting, says Debra Yergen, author of the Creating Job Security Resource Guide. "You're part scientist, part minister, part counselor." 
 Elevator mechanic  ($48,752). When elevators break down with people inside, there's no putting off calling for a repair crew, so this is one construction-related job that's stayed busy. The outlook is positive too: "As cities increase in population, the only way to build is up," says Yergen, "and that means more elevators per square mile." Training is usually on-the-job, though some enter through vocational programs in industrial mechanics or maintenance technology. 
 Commercial diver  ($45,824). Talk about getting out of the office. Professional divers may do repair or welding work on structures such as offshore oil derricks, photograph marine life or conduct tests. A short training course gets you ready to dive. 
 "There's usually a specialization within the field, like demolition or ironwork," says Shatkin. 
 Gaming manager  ($41,818). Casinos are booming, and Yergen notes, "This is one field where your communication skills are far more important than your level of education. You need active listening skills, critical thinking abilities and to be able to offer great customer service." Training is usually on-the-job, while workers are already earning a high average starting salaries. 
 Mathematician  ($58,500). The education requirements for math-related jobs are lengthy – most working mathematicians have a Ph.D., though the BLS reports federal agencies may start you with just a bachelor's degree. Shatkin says one of the largest employers of mathematicians is the National Security Agency, which needs the help of math whizzes to develop algorithms for creating codes and decrypting coded messages.

 10 Jobs that Pay $70,000 Per Year 
 Still wondering if that college degree is worth the cost of tuition? A study from online salary database PayScale.com found that people who hold four-year college degrees will earn approximately 50 percent more than a high school grad over the course of their careers. 
 Even if you graduate with the average level of education debt -- about $21,000, according to The Project on Student Debt -- there are a range of jobs out there to help you pay it off before the term of the loan is up, if you’re diligent. 
 Here are ten jobs that earn at least $70,000 per year, according to PayScale, in industries that are expected to grow through 2018. 
 Nursing Home Manager  - $75,300 
 If you are service-oriented, enjoy solving problems, and want your work to have meaning, consider a career in long term care management. According to the National Association of Boards of Examiners of Long Term Care Administrators (NABWEB), the increasing number of aging Americans and their improved longevity mean that demand for long term health care is on the rise. “Long term care administration exercises management and leadership skills on a daily basis to operate a business that is truly caring for people who have critical needs,” notes Steven Chies, vice president of operations, Long Term Care Services, Benedictine Health System. 
 Video Game Producer  – $73,200 
 If you don’t mind working so others can play, developing gaming software may be your ticket to a good paycheck. Think it’s a niche market? The International Game Developers Association (IGDA), the largest nonprofit membership organization serving individuals who create video games, reports that interactive entertainment takes in about $9 billion dollars in the US alone. According to IGDA data, “Games are expected to surpass film box-office revenues in the next couple of years, making it the fastest growing segment of the entertainment market, and an excellent field for career advancement.” 
 Market Research Manager  – $71,900 
 Want to know what makes people tick? Then there’s no better career than analyzing market research data for a business or an advertising agency. It’s a rapidly growing field, too, thanks to the competition between companies to grab market share in a tough economy. According to the BLS, demand for market and survey researchers is projected to grow 28 percent in the next few years, much faster than the average. Even better, there is no single path to entry into the field, though a business degree with a concentration in marketing is helpful. Likewise, earning a Professional Researcher Certification (PRC) from the Marketing Research Association can help you stand out from the competition. 
 Department Store Buyer  - $70,100 
 Who says retail is struggling? Recent market research suggests that consumers are less uptight about spending as the post-recession. Amid this optimism, the BLS indicated the outlook for the buying and purchasing job market will enjoy 7 percent growth as we head into the next decade. Becoming a buyer for a major retail outlet usually requires a bachelor's degree in business administration or other relevant area. Many senior-level execs began their careers as assistant buyers, but remember to turn your years of toil in a store into an asset as many entry-level jobs require general retail experience. 
 Regional Sales Manager  - $72,600 
 If you enjoy working with people and have a persuasive personality, you’re probably a natural salesperson. Add in organizational and managerial expertise and you can snag the big bucks. Years of sales experience in any industry often count as much as an undergraduate degree in this expanding field. The BLS indicates that sales and marketing managers and their departments constitute some of the most important personnel in an organization and are less subject to downsizing or outsourcing than are other types of managers. Though competition is keen, the BLS estimates the field to grow by 15 percent through 2018 and certification from the National Association of Sales Professionals can put you ahead of the pack. 
 Geologist  - $79,600 
 The increasing need for energy sources, environmental protection, and responsible land and water management will spur employment demand for geologists by 18 percent over the next decade. Geologists with a bachelor’s degree often begin their careers in field exploration or as research assistants or as lab technicians. Though only a handful of states require licensure, in order stay on top of the latest technologies and scientific findings, geologists should pursue continuing education and advanced credentialing according to the American Institute of Professional Geologists. 
  Financial Controller  - $72,000 
 If you’ve got a head for numbers you’ll be indispensible to a variety of businesses. Almost every company and government agency employs one or more financial managers to oversee preparation of financial reports, direct investment activities, and implement cash management strategies. That’s also the reason the job market for this role is expected to grow by 8 percent through 2018, according to the BLS. A four-year degree is required to land an entry-level position but continuing education is critical to be able to keep up with global trade trends and changes in federal and state laws and regulations. Professional certifications from the likes of the CFA Institute can also broaden skills and boost earning power. 
 FBI Agent  - $76,700 
 There’s no such thing as a typical day when you work for the FBI, according to the agency. FBI special agents are responsible for conducting sensitive national security investigations and for enforcing over 300 federal statutes including public corruption, civil rights, bribery, fugitive and drug-trafficking matters. With a college degree, three year’s work experience, and qualifying under one of the special agent entry programs, including accounting, information technology, language, and law, you could be on your way to an exciting and high-paying career. 
  Systems Analyst  - $75,400 
 Computer geeks will be laughing all the way to the bank if they land a job as one of the growing number of systems analysts who help businesses and other organizations determine which computers and software to buy, and integrate into their existing systems. Demand for analysts will increase by 20 percent alongside the development of sophisticated technologies and the need to protect information. Employers are looking for candidates with degree in a technical field such as computer science, applied mathematics, engineering, or management information systems (MIS). 
 School Principal  - $78,400 
 As a generation that’s even more populous than the Boomers, Millenials (born between 1981-1999) are the reason many schools are bursting at the seams. That’s why the BLS is predicting the demand for school principals to grow by 8 percent in the next decade. A master’s degree in education is required for the position and states require that principals to be licensed as school administrators.

 Biggest CEO Bonuses for 2010 
 During this time of year everyone worries about being thought of as naughty or nice. For children being on Santa's nice list mean receiving a plethora of toys under the Christmas tree, but for larger, older kids (i.e. working adults), being on the nice list means getting a big holiday bonus and the possibility of doubling (or better) your yearly earnings. 
 Most S&P companies don't report their bonus figures until the early spring, but there are about 60 companies on the list that have fiscal years that end earlier, meaning they do report their bonuses before the New Year. This gives everyone else a chance to get a glimpse of what Santa has put under the Christmas tree for the CEOs on the "nice" list. 
 ABC News spoke with Aaron Boyd, head of research for Equilar, a company that tracks what top executives are paid, and he said there are two things that are impressive about this year's top CEO bonuses. One, they are really big, and two, bonuses are now more dependant on how well a company performed in the past fiscal year, meaning if your company lost money and did poorly, CEO bonuses will tend to not be as large. "Companies are moving away from payout based purely on the discretion of the board. The trend is toward bonuses that are tied more closely to performance," Boyd told ABC News. 
 Here are the top winners on this year's nice list, making super large bonuses. 
 
 William R. Johnson, chairman and president, H.J. Heinz: $8,589,063  Who knew ketchup could be so lucrative? Well, for this CEO, his bonus for 2010 comes in at $8,589,063. This is an almost 18 percent increase over what he received in 2009. Johnson has been with the ketchup giant since 1982, has helped to expand their ketchup kingdom overseas, especially in China, where he was awarded the Marco Polo Award, the highest business honor China bestows on foreigners. A bonus this large makes you rethink the importance of condiments. 
 Lawrence J. Ellison, chief executive officer, Oracle: $6,453,254  This computer guru and competitive sports enthusiast received a $6,453,254 bonus this year, an almost 80 percent increase over what he received last year. Ellison founded the business software and hardware company in 1977 and has successfully increased sales year after year. You'll think twice before calling this guy a computer geek. 
 John T. Chambers, chairman and CEO, Cisco Systems: $4,600,000  While Chambers' bonus of $4, 600,000 only earns him the No. 3 ranking, his bonuses has increased over 125 percent compared to 2009, and his computer and telecom  networking  company has continued to increase its sales and net  income  from the previous fiscal year. We all could learn something from the way Chambers -- An expert in workplace learning -- runs a business. 
 Mark G. Parker, president and CEO, Nike: $4,441,875  Parker first began working at Nike in 1979, but has only been at the helm of this athletic outfitter since 2006. But, in that time, he has successfully expanded Nike's brands and increased Nike's commitment to corporate responsibility while increasing sales and raising the company's net income almost 30 percent. For his hard work, he has been rewarded with a $4,441,875 bonus a mind-blowing 393.5 percent increase over his 2009 bonus. Talk about just doing it: This CEO is definitely "working out" as the leader of his company. 
 Rupert Murdoch, chairman and CEO, News Corp: $4,368,800  Rounding out the top five is media mogul Murdoch. Since he began his publishing career in 1952 with just one family-owned newspaper in his native Australia, Murdoch has taken the states by storm and his list of accolades now includes  The New York Post, TV Guide, The Daily  (an iPad-only newspaper), DIRECTV and FOX Entertainment Group. Stuffed into this CEO's stocking this year was a $4,368,800 bonus. Don't think of him as greedy though, because this year's bonus is almost 20 percent less than what he was given last year, and at age 79, this media man was still able to increase News Corp.'s net income in 2010, after a $3.31 billion loss in 2009. 
 
 Obviously it goes without saying that these CEO bonuses are way above what average workers receive and even well above what most CEOs get paid at year's end; but all of these highly-bonused CEOs are well known, in the spotlight, and are also the ones who have high base  salaries  to begin with. 
 Also of note is the fact that many top-paid CEOs of well-known companies, such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc., are choosing to take smaller bonuses this year than in previous years to avoid public ridicule proving that concern over perception regarding being naughty or nice really does have an effect on people of all ages, from the youngest of children to the oldest of CEOs.

 America's 20 fastest growing salaries 
 
 When you interview for a job, conventional wisdom says you shouldn't bring up salary. Let the employer broach the topic first. After all, the last thing you want is to give the impression that you're only taking the job for the money. 
 If you think about it, the whole formality of salary discussion is strange. Understandably, an employer wants someone who is passionate about the job. But we all know that money is important, otherwise you'd be volunteering full time. 
 While salary is probably not the only motivation you have for choosing a job, it is an important one. Websites like CBSalary.com and the Bureau of Labor Statistics contain salary information for thousands of jobs so that you can find out what your position typically pays and how it compares with other parts of the country. For example, the average hourly pay increased 1.7 percent over the last year. Did you fare as well? 
 Here, at the comfort of your computer monitor, you don't have to pretend that money means nothing to you. If you're frustrated with the compensation trends for your job, you can vent and no one will know. Or you can see what other industries pay, just out of curiosity. 
 To appease your curiosity or give you some direction for your next job hunt, we put together a list of some of America's fastest growing salaries. Their year-over-year pay increases outpaced the national average by several percentage points.

 $100/Hour - Paid Jobs 
 The average hourly wage in the U.S is $16, according to Al Lee, the director of quantitative analysis at PayScale.com. It is rare to get an hourly rate of $100, which is more than six times than the average hourly wage. However, the following professions may help you get a buck. 
 The top 10 percent of arbitrators can earn $130 on average. They help settle disputes outside of court. Most of them attend law school or have a masters' degree in public policy or law. 
 Individuals and corporations tend to try to stay out of court, thus the outlook for this profession is likely to be above average. 
 Anesthesiologists  administer the drugs that knock a patient out and monitor his/her vital signs during surgery. The patient’ life is in their hands thus average wage for them is impressive, $101.80 per hour. Anesthesiologists in  Arizona  and Tennessee can earn more than $100 an hour. 
 Because of an increasing population and health-care needs, this profession is very promising. 
 The top 10 percent of  freelance photographers  with 5 to 10 years of experience can earn $100 an hour. 
 A  hand model  can earn around $100 per hour. However, models have to protect their “parts” very carefully. One hand model has to moisturize 25 to 30 times a day and wearing gloves everyday is compulsory. 
 Tattoo artists  do not have to work for extended periods of hours but still earn high wages. The top 10 percent of artists receive mean hourly wage of $130. 
 Many tattoo artists do not attend any tattoo schools but learn via an apprenticeship with an experienced tattoo artist. 
 The average hourly rate for  interior designers  is about $100. Besides a bachelor’s degree, it is necessary for interior designers to have a good eye for design. 
 Although demand for interior design will be strong over the following decades, it is tough to compete for the jobs. 
 Life coach  may include part therapist or part career. The mean hourly rate for life coaches ranges from $100 to $150. 
 Saturation divers’ work may be deep-water pipe replacement and pipe repair. According to the Commercial Diving Academy, a diver can earn $900 to $1200 a day when working for extended periods of time in extreme conditions. 
 Underwater welder must have capability to handle the pressure of 700 feet in extreme hours.

 Six-Figure Jobs in High Demand - Yahoo most popular careers … 
 All six-figure jobs were NOT created equal. 
 Not only do some require more education and experience than others, some are just more in demand than others. So, if you want to increase your chances of landing a six-figure job, it helps to know which ones have the most positions available. 
 Finance-related jobs accounted for more than half of the top 25 jobs with the most openings that paid over $100,000, according to research by  Monster.com.  That's everything from a finance manager to an internal audit supervisor and an accounting director. 
 There's still a lot of competition for those jobs, though:  Indeed.com  estimates that for every online job listing in financial services and banking, 30 people click on it. For accounting jobs, that number rises to 34. Health care and information technology had the least clicks per post, while media and construction had the most. 
 
 So, where are the best opportunities? Here are eight of the top six-figure jobs that have the most openings -- and who's hiring. 
 Finance Manager 
 Finance-related positions dominate Monster.com's list of the most in-demand six-figure jobs and, of those, finance managers are near the top of the list. 
 The good thing about pursuing a career as a finance manager is that nearly every company, government agency or other type of organization requires a finance manager -- no matter what the economy's doing. That's the person who oversees the preparation of financial reports and handles the cash management and investment activities of the firm. 
 A bachelor's degree is required by most firms -- and many require a master's degree or professional certification. The hours can be long, typically 50 to 60 hours a week, plus some travel. 
 The field is  expected to grow by 8 percent  over the next decade, which is average, according to the Labor Department. Competition is expected to be tough for these jobs, so those with a master's degree are likely to have the edge. 
 Who 's hiring right now?  Ernst & Young, Bank of America and Deloitte are among the firms doing the most hiring for finance managers, according to Indeed.com. 
 Software Engineers 
 Not only are software engineers in demand right now, the field is expected to be one of the fastest growing over the next decade,  rising 32 percent. 
 But let the programmer beware: While computer software engineers, the guys who write software, are projected be in demand in the next 10 years, demand for computer programmers, the guys who write the instructions for a computer to use that software, is expected to shrink 3 percent in that time. 
 The reason? Software engineers will be in demand due to increased computer networking, expanding technologies and the need for more security on those systems, while programmer demand will take a hit from the rise of open-source software and outsourcing. 
 Most software-engineer positions require a bachelor's degree in computer science, software engineering, or mathematics, and many require graduate degrees. 
 Who 's hiring right now?  Microsoft, EMC and Broadcom, according to Indeed.com. 
 Corporate Public Relations Director 
 Demand for public-relations managers is expected to be stronger than average due to an increasingly competitive and global business environment. It is crucial for a firm to have a good relationship with the public their profitability, whether they're publicly traded or not, is dependent on their reputation. 
 Public-relations managers do everything from managing PR campaigns to doing damage control when a negative rumor or story about the company emerges. Some work traditional 40-hour workweeks but most need to be on call 24-7 in case of emergency. 
 Employment for PR specialists is expected to  grow 24 percent  over the next decade, faster than other professions. Being on top of new trends, like social media, is crucial and additional languages are a bonus. 
 Who 's hiring right now?  Kaiser Permanente and AstraZeneca, according to Indeed.com. 
 Investor-Relations Manager 
 Demand for public-relations managers is expected to be stronger than average and that is particularly true for those who specialize in investor relations, communicating the firm's financial information to investors, analysts and the media. Increased regulation and scrutiny in particular will drive the need for skilled investor-relations managers. 
 The qualifications for this job are unique: Not only does the person have to have strong communications skills but also a firm command of financial systems and statements -- and how to explain that in plain English. They also have to be good at crisis management and willing to work long hours, should the stock come under pressure from a rumor or news event. 
 A bachelor's degree is usually required, with a focus on finance, economics and journalism. Being a member of the National Investor Relations Institute is particularly helpful for networking -- they have local chapters in most states. 
 Who 's hiring right now?  Citigroup and Bank of America, according to Indeed.com. 
 Sales Executive 
 As companies dig out from the recession, sales executives are going to be in particular demand because they're the ones that drive growth, bringing in new business and new sources of revenue. 
 Sales executives are the ones that set strategies and goals, and direct their sales reps for the best way to improve their sales performance. You need good people skills for this job but also good analytical skills -- knowing the trends and making sure your team is out front. There's a lot of pressure with a sales executive job because once you set those goals you have to meet and exceed them. The firm is counting on you. 
 Having a bachelor's and/or MBA is helpful, with courses in marketing as well as law, management, economics, accounting, finance, mathematics and statistics helping to provide an extra edge. Most firms tend to promote from within. Advancement is typically quicker at large firms than small ones, according to the Labor Department's outlook for the industry. 
 Who 's hiring right now?  IBM, CSC and ADP, according to Indeed.com. 
 Compensation Analyst 
 A compensation analyst develops salary, bonus and benefits structures, identifies compensation and benefits issues and makes adjustments based on new regulatory requirements. 
 Typically this position requires a bachelor's degree, preferably in mathematics, business administration or human-resources management. 
 Not only is there solid demand for compensation analysts today but the outlook is also strong  for the next decade,  due to health-care reform and globalization. 
 Who 's hiring right now?  KPMG, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, according to Indeed.com. 
 Associate Professor 
 The number of tenure-track professors is on the decline as schools increasingly seek flexibility in dealing with compensation issues, making associate professors one of the most in-demand $100k+ jobs on Monster.com. 
 The trend now is toward hiring professors for limited-term contracts, typically 2 to 5 years. Competition is expected to be tough for the tenured positions and often a professor will have to move into a more administrative or managerial role such as department chairperson in order to achieve tenure. Those with a PhD have the best job prospects, according to the Labor Department. 
 Overall, demand for postsecondary teachers is expected to  grow by 15 percent  in the next decade, faster than average, as enrollment is projected to increase -- not just among those 18 to 24 but also adults returning to college to change professions or enhance their prospects in an existing field. Demand is expected to be strongest for professors in fast-growing fields such as business, nursing, biological sciences and other health specialties. 
 Who 's hiring right now?  George Mason, University of Iowa and University of Miami, according to Indeed.com. 
 Company Attorney 
 Globalization and legislative changes are driving the need for more in-house attorneys. 
 Among other issues a corporate attorney has to deal with are patents, contracts, property interests and negotiating with unions. Lawyers typically work long hours, though the hours are slightly less brutal for corporate attorneys. 
 Not only is demand strong now but it's projected to be  strong over the next decade,  according to the Labor Department, amid increased demand for services such as health care, intellectual property, bankruptcy, corporate and security litigation, antitrust law and environmental law. Though, a shift toward using big accounting firms or paralegals for some of these functions will curb demand to some degree. Economic downturns also take a toll as companies are less inclined to pay hefty legal fees. 
 Competition is expected to be tough, so a willingness to relocate is a plus. 
 Who 's hiring right now?  KPMG, Ernst & Young and JPMorgan Chase, according to Indeed.com.
