 **On the Job Injury Lawyer - Queens, NY ** 
 You use your knees in your everyday life and at work. If you sustain a knee injury, it will become very difficult to bend, stand and even sit down. Unfortunately, it’s possible to suffer knee injuries just about anywhere, including the workplace. While most knee injuries occur in strenuous jobs, like construction, they can also occur in sedentary jobs. If you believe you injured your knee at work, you may be eligible for workers’ compensation benefits. An experienced  Queens, New York on the job injury lawyer  will be able to clarify your situation and help you to fully explore your legal options. 
 Causes of Knee Injuries at Work 
 Falls are one of the most common ways employees suffer knee injuries at work. Whether it’s a big or small fall, you can suffer serious knee damage. Here are some examples of the type of damage that your knee can suffer during a fall: 
 **- Dislocated Knee: It’s possible to dislocate your knee during a fall. When this happens, you knock it out of its normal position. These knee injuries typically occur during blunt force trauma. 
 ****- Chrondromalacia Patallae: If you bend your knee after taking a fall, you could develop this injury. The cartilage can tear and you can experience acute pain at the front of your knee. In addition to pain, you may experience a grinding or clicking noise when you bend or straighten your knee. 
 **-Fractured Kneecap: A fall can also fracture the patella at the front of the knee. You may also injure the surrounding tendons and ligaments. 
 If you are eligible for workers’ compensation benefits, the exact nature of your injury should and the nature of your fall should not matter in re: receiving the benefits you are entitled to. If you are not eligible for such benefits, a Queens, NY on the job injury lawyer may be able to help you file an alternative legal claim. 
 **Treatments for Knee Injuries 
 **There are many types of treatments available for knee injuries these days. The type of treatment you will receive will depend on several factors, such as the type of injury you sustained. For example, if your knee injury was fairly minor, your doctor may suggest to get plenty of rest and keep the knee elevated. Alternating ice and heat may also reduce pain and swelling. 
 If your knee injury more severe, physical therapy may be necessary. A physical therapist will have you do several exercises to make your knees stronger again. 
 Surgery may be needed for the most severe knee fractures, but it’s generally a last resort. Allowing a Queens, NY on the job injury lawyer to help you secure any compensation you may be entitled to will help to ensure that your medical costs (now and into the future) remain manageable. 
 Getting Workers’ Compensation Benefits for Knee Injuries 
 If you suffered a knee injury at work, it’s important to file a workers’ compensation claim as soon as possible. The compensation should be able to cover your medical bills and lost wages. 
 However, if your knee injury requires extensive treatment, your claim may get more complicated. Severe injuries often require tens of thousands of dollars in treatment costs and many insurance companies don’t want to pay that. That’s why it’s very important to hire an experienced Queens, NY on the job injury lawyer to handle your case. The legal team at  Polsky, Shouldice & Rosen, P.C.  can make sure your legal rights are protected and improve your chances of getting a fair settlement.
