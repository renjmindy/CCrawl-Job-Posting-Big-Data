  How To Deal With Multiple Jobs At The Same Employer On Your Resume  
 Don Goodman 
 February 29, 2016 
 Resume writing comes with many questions like what to include, how much to include, and how far back to go when it comes to detailing work experience. It can get particularly complicated when you’ve worked with the same employer and held several positions with them.

 How do you layout all the information on the resume so that it’s succinct, yet tells a story that will impress the potential employer? Some employers may see your long-term employment as dedication, but to other employers, it may raise red flags on whether you can adjust to a new job and if you’ve made progress in your career by staying with one employer. To add to the complication, you also have to think about how to format the content on your resume so that it’s Applicant Tracking System (ATS)-friendly. Poor formatting means the ATS may skip over an entire section of information on your resume. For more on the ATS, read:  “5 Tips To Improving Your Applicant Tracking System Ranking.”  To help ease the resume writing process in situations where you have held several jobs with one employer, follow these tips: 
 1. Only list one period of employment with each employer. 
 The ATS looks for a certain pattern of information to tell it where one section of your work experience begins and where it ends. It usually looks for dates on the resume to locate job titles and employers, so you should avoid listing more than one period of employment with each employer if you don’t want to confuse the ATS. There are several ways in which you can format your information: 
 
 
 Company Name, List Your Job Titles (start with the most recent first) (Date of Employment) – It’ll read like  XYZ Company, Office Manager / Executive Assistant / Administrative Assistant (2012 – Present) . Make note to also put a space before and after each “/.” The ATS may not know to search for keywords in combination of a “/.” 
 
 
 Company name, Present Job Title (Date of Employment) – It’ll read like  XYZ Company, Office Manager (2012 – Present).  Include information on other positions held under the heading along with the rest of the content you highlight for the work period. For example,  Earlier positions include….  then include highlights from the positions. There’s no need to break down the period of employment for each of the prior positions. 
 
 
 2. Highlight your promotions. 
 When you’ve been with an employer long, potential employers fear you may have fallen too comfortable with them and your skills and progression for advancement has remained stagnant. To alleviate these negative perceptions, draw attention to any changes you’ve made in positions held. It can be a move you made to work in a different department or highlighting your successes and promotions on the job. For example, using a bullet point, indicate:  Promoted within 9 months for exceptional client relations skills that resulted in the win of pharma client’s global marketing business.  __ 
 3. Prioritize your information. 
 When you have several jobs under one employer grouped together on the resume, it’s important to prioritize the information you have under it. While describing your roles and responsibilities and highlighting achievements and success, think about the order of importance and relevance. You want to lead with what’s most impressive to the potential employer first. Utilizing these tips, you’ll have a resume that demonstrates to potential employers that you’re a candidate with great potential – you’re not only dedicated, but you can also perform and achieve outstanding results.
