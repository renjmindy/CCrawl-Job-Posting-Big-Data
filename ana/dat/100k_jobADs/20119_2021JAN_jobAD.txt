 Video Job Postings 
 January 13, 2017  by  Media272   Uncategorized 
 Offer your new-hire prospects a behind-the-scenes virtual tour of the position and team they are applying to join. Utilize  Video Job Postings  to present your office, staff and position descriptions in an engaging and visually appealing way. 
 Instead of scheduling on-site interviews and wasting your staff's time with introductions to applicants they'll never see again, let prospects screen themselves by opening a window into your office culture. Top candidates will appreciate the work you put into the job listing, and if you use a headhunter they'll have exactly what they need to entice heavy hitters away from competitors! 
 Our videographers will spend a single day on-location at your office turning empty desks into alluring beauty shots, coaching your staff for the best sound bytes and producing what will become a web optimized electronic job listing perfect for Monster.com, TeamWorkOnline, LinkedIn and any other avenue through which your HR department operates. 
 What to Expect 
 Though shooting only takes a single day, we collaborate with you beforehand to determine which of your staff to feature and what aspects of your business or staff openings you'd like to be documented. Uniformed videographers will conveniently come to your office with all cameras, lighting and green screen gear necessary. During the shoot our videographers will happily coach camera-shy folks into looking and sounding their best, and will also collate all contact info and video release signatures while on-site so no additional follow-up is required. 
 Following the shoot, our post-production department will edit a template video that adheres to your branding guidelines and includes applicable contact information for prospective candidates.  Video Job Postings  are available in most major U.S. metro markets.
