 09 Miscellaneous jobs 2008 
 Apart from the things mentioned in the sections above, I did a number of smaller jobs: 
 
 
 Varnishing the doors 
 
 
 Varnishing the hatch and instrument box 
 
 
 Starting on a new electricity installation 
 
 
 Not ideal, but I'll continue this winter. The panel to the left was a temporary place for the pump control… 
 
 
 Rewiring and mounting of the fridge. 
 
 
 … 
 
 
 This is what the electricity panel looks like now (2009): 
 The big while cover on the left is a Nasa BM-1 battery monitor.
