 Good jobs are still out there for those without four-year degrees 
 Don't panic. You can still earn a decent living without having to get a Bachelor's degree. 
 By Matt Parke 
 July 27, 2017 
 The blue collar road to a well-paying "good job" is not a dead end, but more of a route "under construction" with some slight detours, according to a new study and website from the  Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce  (CEW). 
 And at the end of this road are 30 million jobs with median salaries around $55,000 for people without Bachelor's degrees. That's more than a  livable wage  in many U.S. states.

 With support from JP Morgan Chase & Co.'s  "New Skills at Work" initiative , CEW launched its " Good Jobs Data " website this month with an  accompanying report  and  informative video  on its findings which you can watch above.

 What does a "good job" for the 75 million high school-educated-only workforce entail anymore? CEW says that a good job begins with a $35,000 base salary which turns out to be $17 an hour. Of these 30 million good jobs out there, 14 million of them can earn workers between $35K and $55K.

Economic Supplement (March), 1992-2016. 
 Many of these good jobs are now being found in growth sectors in finance and healthcare, reflecting the rise of middle-skill work requiring some college or technical certification. CEW reports that the number of good jobs decreased for high school-only workers but the number of good jobs requiring an Associate's degree increased by 83 percent. 
 As the nation's workforce adapts to pressures brought on by structural unemployment by re-skilling for good jobs, it has turned out to be a boon for the current low unemployment economy. 
 CEW says that "skilled-service" jobs have surpassed the amount of lost "good jobs" in dominant employment sectors like manufacturing and transportation. Since 1991, these industries have experienced a loss of around 3 million jobs, due to increased automation and offshoring. What the study found was that skilled-services employment netted 4 million good jobs in that time.

 To maintain this growth, CEW says changing education, especially at the community college level, is paramount. They recommend that post-secondary education must match the demands of the job market. In California, where a majority of "good jobs" are found, the  community college system is reinventing itself  as a regionally-aligned workforce creator to boost the amount of skilled workers by 1 million.

 So despite losses in good jobs available to workers with just a high school degree, CEW says that there is plenty to be optimistic about. With a little bit of education, American workers have shown that they can still attain good jobs in the new economy and get paid, all without acquiring a BA. Keeping this good news going will be the challenge for policymakers, educators and employers to face together.
