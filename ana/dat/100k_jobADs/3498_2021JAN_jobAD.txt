 Scholarships and grants for ecologists 
 National funding bodies (Germany) 
 
 DFG  - the DFG (German Research Foundation) is the self-governing organisation for science and research in Germany, similar to NSF in the US. Various programs for funding. However, you usually need a PhD to apply, and some link to Germany. 
 DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) 
 Alexander von Humboldt Foundation  - various programmes to promote exchange between German and international Scientists. Incoming scholarships for PostDocs and Faculty. 
 Volkswagen Foundation 
 Robert Bosch Foundation  
 
 National funding bodies (other countries) 
 
 CSIC (Spain) 
 CNRS (France) 
 
 European funding bodies 
 
 Marie Curie Actions : probably the best known post-doc grants from the EU, good overall conditions, but also quite competitive. 
 European Research Council (ERC) : The ERC is a relatively new funding body within the EU. It offers highly attractive grants for experienced researchers (Advanced Grants) up to 3.5m Euro for up to 5 Years, and starting grants for young researchers amounting to up to 2m Euro for up to 5 years 
 Joint Research Centre : The JRC, another possible employer of scientists, provided scientific advice to the European Comission and the member states of the EU. It is distributed in 6 centers across Europe, the most logical place for ecologists would be the JRC in Ispra. 
 ESF : The European Science Foundation (ESF) supports various projects and activities, however, typically not on the level of individual researchers. 
 
 Special Programs 
 This is a very random selection - the DAAD scholarship database above has much more options 
 
 Harvard Fellowships in Sustainability Science 
 Microsoft Research PhD Scholarship  (for PhD positions, proposal written by potential advisor) 
 Omidyar Fellowship at the Santa Fe Institute 
 Wallenberg Academy Fellows , a private initiative to support young researchers in Sweden 
 
 Traveling grants 
 
 Bilateraler Wissenschaftleraustausch des BMELV 
 DAAD cooperation grants such as PPP (Programme des Projektbezogenen Personenaustauschs)  
 BES grants 
 BayFrance  (cooperation Bavaria-France, students + researchers) 
 
 For Faculty 
 
 Feodor Lynen-Stipendium  - Das Auslandsstipendium für deutsche Professoren und Postdocs 
 Semester at sea 
 
 Teaching and workshops 
 
 ERASMUS Intensive programmes  - An Intensive Programme (IP) is a short programme of study which brings together students and teaching staff from higher education institutions of at least three participating countries. It can last from 10 continuous full days to 6 weeks of subject related work. 
 ERASMUS Staff Mobility  Teaching staff mobility enables staff to spend a teaching period between 1 day - or at least 5 teaching hours – and 6 weeks at a higher education institution in another participating country. 
 OECD -  workshops and travel grants 
 
 Frequently asked questions / situations 
 
 I want to do a PhD  : make sure you know why you want to do a PhD (career goal), how a PhD works (google, read experiences), and what you want to do (topic). If you have this sorted out, it makes sense to contact  relevant people  directly, but make sure that you can clearly explain the points above. See hints  1 . 
 I am German / European resident and I am looking for a PhD / Postdoc in Germany  - most links below should be quite relevant for you. 
 I am from a developing / emerging country, and I would like to do a PostDoc / research stay in Germany  - look at the section "National funding bodies". DAAD or AvH are the most likely option. You need a German host. 
 How do get a  faculty position ? Advice for US:  1 ,  2 , Germany  1 ,  2 , 
 
 Important hints 
 
 How to contact people you would like to work with:  when looking for a job, you will have to contact people you don't know. Consider that these people are usually quite busy. Don't send "standard email templates". If you want to make a successful first contact, you need to demonstrate that you have familiarized yourself with the scientific work of your recipient, and that there is a realistic connection (see point 2). 
 Contact only relevant people:  academia is highly specialized. There is very little chance that a group will hire PhD candidate / researcher without prior experience on their topic. In some cases this happens because particular expertise is needed, but you should find out if that is the case. Don't waste the time of people with unrealistic proposals.
