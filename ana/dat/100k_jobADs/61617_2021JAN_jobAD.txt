  3 Tips for Finding Federal Job Opportunities Right for You  
 Work It Daily 
 March 24, 2010 
 By CAREEREALISM-Approved Expert, Dr. Daphne Houston  Many federal job seekers think their federal job search starts when they get on the main federal job board,  USAjobs.com . But if you don’t have a federal background, your job search should start before you get to the job board, so you know what to look for, whether you find a job that fits on USAjobs or not. This is especially important if you are coming from traditional corporate/private sector backgrounds like sales and marketing, customer service, finance and accounting, professional services or law.  Tip 1 - FOLLOW THE MONEY  When you watch, listen and read the news  ;  REALLY watch and listen to the news. Don’t just listen to them say,  “Obama did this, Congress did that.”  They passed this bill or that bill. Ask yourself,  “What does that mean? What happens next?”  Ask yourself,  “What does that mean in terms of funding?”  Even if you don’t agree with the actions being taken to resolve the situation, consider the funding and budgeting. Check out  www.recovery.gov  to see where the Recovery Act money is being allocated and how that affects hiring.  Tip 2 - FOLLOW THE DRAMA AND TRAGEDY  When someone tries to blow up a plane with a bomb in his underwear, you can bet there are a whole host of actions that are going to take place around that...more monitoring and intelligence as in analysis, research, technology, security, foreign language skills. The  Department of Homeland Security  was developed in response to the 911 tragedy and is doing lots of hiring.  Enjoying this article?

Tip 3 - FOLLOW THE FUTURE  When a large percentage of the President’s State of the Union address is focused on energy, and energy alternatives, that means you should be looking at the potential in energy related agencies and endeavors. Some agencies to research are:  Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, HUD  , and  www.recovery.gov  to find out about funding and contracts for energy initiatives. Finding the right opportunities is one of the steps to land that federal job. If you need more assistance, sign up for Dr. Daphne's free courses and webinars at  www.budurl.com/nyy5 .
