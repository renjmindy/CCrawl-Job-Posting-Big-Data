 Smorgasbord Laughter Lines - Snitching, Cheating, Failing‚Ä¶ and a change of career. 
 Posted on  January 10, 2019  by   Smorgasbord - Variety is the Spice of Life. 
 If you would like to share your favourite joke.. and get a plug in for your blog or books.. then email it to me at sally.cronin@moyhill.com (this is a family show!) 
 The phone rings at police headquarters. 
 'Hello' 
 'Hello is this the police?' 
 'Yes, What do you want?' 
 'I'm calling to report my neighbour Tom. He is hiding heroin in his woodpile.' 
 'This will be not 
 The next day a squad of DEA agents arrive a Tom's house. They search the shed where the firewood is kept, they chop every piece of wood apart but find no heroin. Furious they leave. 
 The phone rings at Tom's house. 
 'Hey Tom, did the DEA come?' 
 'Yeah.' 
 'Did they chop your firewood?' 
 'Yeah they did.' 
 'Okay, now it's your turn to call, I need my garden dug over.' 
 Over Christmas at a school nativity play, three six year olds were playing the part of the kings. During the scene at the stable, the first stepped forward with his gift and said 'Gold.' 
 The second stepped forward and said 'Myrrh.' 
 And the third little boy stepped up and said 'And Frank sent this.' 
 A door to door salesman knocked on a door of a well to do house in Wimbledon. 'Good morning,' he said. 'Would you care to buy a copy of One Hundred Excuses To Give Your Wife for Staying Out Late?' 
 'Why on earth would I want a book like that?' said the enraged lady of the house. 
 'Because,' replied the salesman, 'I sold a copy to your husband at his office this morning!' 
 Time for some more actual exam results from 16 year olds ‚Ä¶. 
 What is a vacuum? 
 Something my mum says I should do more often. 
 What is a vibration? 
 There are good vibrations and bad vibrations. Good vibrations were discovered in the 1960s. 
 Discuss the style of Romeo and Juliet. 
 It is written entirely in islamic pentameter. The play is full of heroic couplets, one example being Romeo and Juliet themselves . 
 Where was the American Declaration of Independence signed? 
 At the bottom. 
 Thank you for dropping in and hope you are leaving with a smile on your face.. thanks Sally.
