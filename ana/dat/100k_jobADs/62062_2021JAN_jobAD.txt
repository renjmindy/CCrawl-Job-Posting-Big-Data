 INDIANAPOLIS — Josh McDaniels has backed out of a deal to become the Indianapolis Colts head coach, a decision that shocked the franchise hours after it announced his hiring. 
 The Colts confirmed McDaniels’ decision in a statement Tuesday night after reports emerged that the Patriots offensive coordinator had opted to stay in New England with head coach Bill Belichick.

 McDaniels had agreed to contract terms with the Colts to replace the fired Chuck Pagano. A news conference had been scheduled for Wednesday at Lucas Oil Stadium.

 Stuff about me 
 
 
 My name is Keith Michaud and this is “Letters From Away,” a blog written by a Mainer living outside the comfortable and sane confines of New England. The blog is intended for Mainers, whether they live in the Pine Tree State or beyond, and for anyone who has loved ’em, been baffled by ’em or both. Ayuh, I am “from away.” Worse still, I live on the Left Coast – in California. Enjoy! Or not. Your choice.
