 Job Seekers FAQs 
 WHY WOULD I CHOOSE A CONTRACT ASSIGNMENT? 
 Contracting has become very prevalent in the Life Science and Medical-related industries. The candidate who goes to work for one company and retires after 30 years with a gold watch is a thing of the past. 
 Some candidates prefer contract employment opportunities for the following reasons: 
 
 They can achieve a higher earning potential because they get paid hourly and often receive adjusted overtime pay. 
 They get paid weekly as W-2 employees and still have access to a full benefits package. 
 
 HOW DO I BEGIN WORKING WITH WORK/LIFE RECRUITING? 
 Start by exploring our  open jobs  and  sending your resume  to us. One of our recruiters will review it and reach out to you, whether or not we currently have any positions that fit your background. We want to start a conversation with you. 
 WHAT CAN I EXPECT FROM WORK/LIFE RECRUITING AFTER I SUBMIT MY RESUME? 
 Once we review your resume and believe that we have an employment opportunity for you, we will contact you to schedule a phone conversation. We may also ask you to complete an online questionnaire related specifically to the position. 
 Our conversation will be about you. We want to know about your professional experiences and expectations. It’s also an opportunity for you to ask questions about our hiring partner and the open job opportunity. 
 Even if you’re the most highly-qualified professional, we don’t always have a job that matches your career direction right away. However, once we have your resume, we’ll be on the lookout for future opportunities that will advance your career. 
 WILL I KNOW WHERE I STAND IN THE SELECTION PROCESS? 
 Communication and courtesy are extremely important at our recruiting agency. We make it a priority to keep you in the loop as the recruitment process moves forward. Job seekers often tell us that our recruiters go the extra mile to keep all stakeholders informed with clear and timely correspondence. 
 DOES WORK/LIFE RECRUITING KEEP ITS CLIENTS CONFIDENTIAL? 
 Absolutely. We keep our hiring partners confidential until we have a conversation with you. Once we determine your requirements are a probable match with our partner’s opportunity, we’ll share their details with you. 
 There are typically two reasons for initial confidentiality. 
 
 
 Recruiters are paid commissions for successfully placing a candidate. Therefore, we keep our client list confidential until we have a conversation with a candidate. 
 
 
 Some companies who engage our firm are conducting confidential searches, and we're often asked to limit information about open positions to protect our clients’ interests. 
 
 
 WHAT TYPE OF POSITIONS DOES WORK/LIFE RECRUITING REPRESENT? 
 Work/Life Recruiting represents full-time, direct-hire and contract opportunities with both local and multinational employers. Occasionally, we represent temporary to permanent placement opportunities. 
 Our recruiting services primarily fill STEM roles for companies in the Life Science and Medical-related industries. Our recruiters specialize in finding talent for Sales, Engineering, Supply Chain, Accounting and Finance, and Quality/Regulatory roles. Check our  open jobs  to view all of our employment opportunities. 
 WILL I BE INFORMED BEFORE YOU SEND MY CREDENTIALS TO THE EMPLOYER? 
 Yes! For you to shape your own career, this must happen. It is in your best interest to know which employers receive your resume. 
 WILL YOU SEND MY RESUME TO ANYONE ELSE WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE? 
 Never. We build relationships based on trust, and that’s only possible with transparency. Our recruiters always obtain your permission before our agency shares your information with anyone. Period.
