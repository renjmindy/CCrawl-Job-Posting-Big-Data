 What do clients say about working with you? 
 
 
 “I would highly recommend Terry Wynne to anyone in the job search process. Within one month after completing coaching, I got the job of my dreams in business development with a fortune 100 company. Terry is very thorough and well-informed about many industries. Without question, her greatest strength is that she truly cares about her clients. Coaching was the best investment I ever made!” 
 
 
 “I would highly recommend Terry Wynne to anyone seeking career or life coaching. She is professional, knowledgeable and highly effective. But more importantly, she is passionate and takes a genuine interest in her client’s success. This quality truly distinguishes Terry… and I truly believe it is the factor that drives her clients to successfully reaching their goals.” 
 
 
 “When I started the process of coaching, I was full of indecision. Many opportunities presented themselves and I didn’t know in which direction to go. Since my life was changing, I needed some direction. Terry was able to get to my heart so I could see my own motivation. During the process of coaching…I was better able to understand the path that I should take. I’ve made a choice to go to graduate school and eventually get a doctorate. If anyone wants coaching, you have got to work with Terry!” 
 
 
 “Coaching provided me with insight into myself through questioning of what I wanted out of my life and career. I gained clarity and a sense of control of what I wanted out of my career path which was empowering for me. As a result of coaching, I feel much more prepared and confident to answer questions in an interview by phone or in person. Confidence is a major take away….I have already recommended Terry to many people. Thank you for a wonderful experience in coaching.”
