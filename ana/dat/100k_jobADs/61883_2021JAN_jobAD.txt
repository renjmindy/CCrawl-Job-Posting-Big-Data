 Remote Team CTO & Partner At V3 Digital LTD 
 Our vision is to create the biggest multi-channel marketing funnel in the cryptocurrency space. That involves breaking down our market into relevant sub niches, building and scaling at least one business unit in each. 
 We aim to do this by creating the top quality crypto educational content and data tools for our audience. 
 Enter - V3 Digital LTD 
 We already own and operate one of the biggest crypto YouTube channels in the space and have a sizable presence on social media platforms. On top of that, we already operate websites that draw in hundreds of thousands of unique viewers a month. 
 All that is done in English and we are currently expanding out to other languages and sub niches by replicating our business strategy with help from local partners. 
 To date, we have already got a proven business model: 
 
 We are post revenue and are already generating sizable net profit every month. 
 Our social and YouTube channel assets are some of the biggest and fastest growing assets in the niche. 
 We already have a network of contacts that are offering equity in startups funded by Ycombinator and are asking for our marketing expertise in return. 
 Already we have built up multiple profitable revenue streams. 
 
 We are a team of marketers & educators who are now looking for a CTO to help build out and improve some of our existing website assets. This would include: 
 
 Updating one of our core website assets with additional features and affiliate CTAs. 
 Improving the look and feel of our merchandise store 
 Refining our crypto staking aggregator site 
 
 The vision is that our CTO would also lead our future development division. 
 Our team has already created successful exits in the past and we are confident in achieving an exciting valuation in the future. 
 It should be noted that the business is completely self-funded and we have no need for VC funding. We have bootstrapped the business into a highly profitable position. And now, we are actively investing this profit into numerous business lines and ventures. 
 All that means that we can offer: 
 
 Salary: $40k > $60k 
 Equity 2% > 3% 
 
 Who Are We Looking For? 
 We are looking for aggressive development talent that has the ability to manage development teams remotely. Startup experience is preferred. However, the key thing is that you share our vision and ethos. We highly value the following attributes: 
 
 Initiative and outside the box thinking. 
 A self-starter. 
 We are going into battle with you. We need someone who has the tenacity and drive to get the job done! 
 Experience in managing teams and working independently. 
 The motivation, capacity and skills to be a key player in helping us grow the business into a unicorn. 
 
 We highly value partner input and any advice on the best way to execute a certain tech solution would be highly valued and listened to. 
 Essential Skills 
 
 Custom Wordpress theme / plugin development experience (huge plus) 
 Full stack web development skills 
 Polyglot programmer capable of getting hands-on in a variety of languages with expertise in Javascript / PHP 
 Strong understanding of SEO 
 Native level English skills 
 Always contactable 
 
 Skills That Are Nice To Have 
 
 Mobile App Development Experience 
 Node.js, Python, Ruby 
 
 We are offering a truly collaborative opportunity, with a salary and a sizable equity stake in the business. 
 Yes, you could gamble on the hopes and dreams of a pre-revenue startup and get a higher equity stake. Or you could partner up with a group of experienced entrepreneurs that have been there and done it. A team that is offering you equity in a profitable and high growth-business. 
 Along with all that, we would offer you the ability to play a vital role in helping us steer the future direction of the company. 
 Thanks for taking the time out to read this.
