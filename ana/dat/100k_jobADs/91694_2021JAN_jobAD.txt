 In June 2005, I entered Saint Louis University and there I took a degree in Bachelor of Science in Nursing and graduated in March 2009, at the age of 19. I passed the examination for nurses on June of the same year . 
 During the four years, I ranked above average of my class. I enjoyed my duties and responsibilities as a student nurse with the different areas in the hospital, and I believe that I have developed the ability to handle the more challenging and responsible work that would be required in your institution. 
 This is my first attempt to apply as a nurse and to practice my profession, and it is a privilege for me if ever I will be given the chance to work with you.
