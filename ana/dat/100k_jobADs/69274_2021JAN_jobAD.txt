  The #1 Most Overlooked Reason Why People Can’t Find Jobs  
 Michael Price 
 November 10, 2014 
 "At least 70%, if not 80% of jobs are not published, and yet most people — they are spending 70 or 80% of their time surfing the net versus getting out there, talking to employers, taking some chances [and] realizing that the vast majority of hiring is friends and acquaintances hiring other trusted friends and acquaintances." [ NPR ]  Related:   The 8 Most Overlooked Threats To A Successful Career  Seeing as how an overwhelming majority of jobs are not advertised on or offline, failing to seek out these positions has become the #1 most overlooked reason why people can’t find jobs. The Internet makes the attainment of information easier, faster and more efficient. However, when it comes to job hunting, the Internet has paralyzed us with a false sense of security. Often times, finding the right job is like most other things in life. It’s about being in the right place at the right time, and how can you be in the right place at the right time if you’re stuck sitting behind your computer. If you really want to find a job you need to get off of your computer and hit the pavement. Here are three unconventional, yet time-tested ways to finding a job: 
 
 1. Consult friends and family 
 Friends and family should be your first line of offense when looking for a job. They can be valuable sources for job leads as employers are more willing to consider a new hire who comes recommended from an existing employee versus a stranger on the street. 
 2. Contact businesses directly 
 Make a list of every business in your area that is within your field. This is one place where the Internet becomes extremely handy. You can start by using a business directory such as bizjournals.com to find a list of businesses in your area sorted by industry, or you can perform various other Google searches. Once you’ve developed a list of businesses, visit their websites and navigate to their contact, human resources and employment pages. Be sure to contact each business to determine if they have any job openings available within your field. 
 3. Contact staffing agencies 
 Staffing agencies are offline versions of job posting boards, except they have a much deeper desire to find you a job, because they’re only paid when they match you with a position. Be sure that when contacting staffing agencies that you only work with agencies that do not require a fee. Companies that require a fee are typically illegitimate.
