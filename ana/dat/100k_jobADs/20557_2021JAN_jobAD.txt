 Position Summary 
 The Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry is looking for a Postdoctoral Fellow in Beta-cell Regeneration Research in the Shapiro - Stem Cell Diabetes lab. 
 Diabetes is a global health problem worldwide with a huge economic burden. Cell therapies, such as induced pluripotent stem cells could provide a replenishable source of beta cells. Optimized methods and scale-up strategies for human stem cell-derived beta cells could potentially translate this into clinical therapy. 
 Progressive deterioration of pancreatic beta cells is a hallmark of both type-1 and -2 diabetes. Stem cell therapy shows great promise and has a clear proof of concept to reverse diabetes, but with a limitation of production of sufficient tissue mass for transplant. More advanced methods could lead to scale-up and mass production of reliable stem cell-derived beta cells without off-target cells. The candidate for this position will use 3D-suspension culture methods to optimize beta-cell differentiation protocols and deliver scale-up of these endocrine cells. 
 Responsibilities 
 ESC/iPS cell culture, maintenance, and differentiation into pancreatic lineage cells. Time spent: 70% (including data analysis). 
Basic cell biology techniques such as DNA/RNA purification, Q-PCR gene expression, Immunochemistry, protein analysis, Flow cytometry, and Immunoassay (ELISA). Time spent: 15% (including data analysis). 
Experience in genome editing using Crispr/cas9 and genetic mutation analysis will be an asset. Time spent: 10-15% (including data analysis). 
 Experience working with mice. Time spent:  <2%. 
 Qualifications 
 A PhD degree in Immunology, Biochemistry, Biotechnology, Cell Biology or a related discipline. 
Publication of a review article. 
Good manuscript publication record, preferably at least one first author publication. 
Excellent organizational and communication skills. 
Strong English writing skills. 
 Proficiency in basic software applications:  Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Graphing Software applications.
