  Bad (Really Bad!) Job Seeker Advice  
 J.T. O'Donnell 
 March 10, 2012 
 It's funny how many well-intended people give out the single worst, I mean REALLY bad piece of  job seeker advice  to their family and friends. As you can imagine, whenever I get caught up in a conversation about my work, people always want to tell me about a job seeker they know and the advice they gave them. It goes something like this: 
 
 
 THEM:  So J.T., what do you do?  ME:  I'm a career coach.  THEM:  Really? Oh, do I know someone you could help. My (insert friend or family member here), has been out of work for a while. And you know what their problem is? They aren't applying to enough jobs. Honestly, I don't know what they are doing all day. They've got eight hours of free time. You'd think if they wanted a job bad enough, they'd be applying to 100+ jobs each day. 
 
 Ugh!  It's gotten to the point I just smile and nod and say, "I'm sorry to hear they are struggling. Let them know about CAREEREALISM becuase I think it can help." I don't bother explaining any more why that is the  single worst piece of job seeker advice  on the planet.  Watch my short video above to hear why. Job seeker advice should aways be about quality, not quantity. Yes, you do need to apply to more than one job each week to get hired. But trust me, the answer is not "spraying and praying" your resume to any job out there. In this, the mother of all recessions, the secret to getting a job is counter-intuitive in that it's about focus. It's the attention to details, the strategy, and most importantly, the mindset that gets you hired. So, for any of you out there who have been told to apply to 200 jobs per week - please, I beg you, STOP the insanity! And, the next time someone gives you that advice, send them to this post - I'll set them straight for you!
