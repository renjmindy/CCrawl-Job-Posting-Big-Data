 Placement on Horse ranches and Stud Farms in Ireland 
 A dream for horse lovers - In Ireland, the Emerald Isle 
 You love horses more than anything else? In Ireland we can help you land jobs on horse ranches, stud farms and riding stables, offering you free accommodation and meals in exchange for work! You will not only do the whole day what you love most, but you will also learn how to get more independent and maybe launch your equine-related career! 
 Ireland's horse industry is known all over the world. Not only is the country known to have first class racing horses, but also some of the best sport horses in the world! With a job at stud farms, riding schools or one of our horse-friendly family farms you can gain experience in horse care and train your riding skills! 
 Imagine you’re on a horseback, galloping on a picturesque sandy beach. Your gaze wanders over the landscape and you wonder how many shades of green there can actually be on one single island. Slowly you rein your horse and stop for a moment: A dramatic coastal panorama opens up in front of you with imposing cliffs that drop almost vertically into the sea. What a spectacular sight! Ireland's untouched natural landscapes are a true paradise for horse lovers: Gentle, green hilly landscapes invite you to long ride outs through quaint villages and past dreamy ruins. As a horse lover, you can make your dream of life among horses come true, spend a lot of time outdoors and explore the breathtaking diversity of the Green Island! 
 What is the job about? 
 Did you know that 53,000 people in Ireland are currently employed in the sport horse sector? In addition, many hundreds of thousands of people in Ireland have horses as a hobby. There are horses literally everywhere on the Green Island! We offer placements on a variety of horse farms - from stud farms with many employees to small family farms, riding schools and family breeders who train their own young stock and participate in local tournaments and competitions. You can imagine that there is always a lot to do on an Irish horse farm! This is where you come in! 
 How can you get involved? 
 Barn jobs include simple grooming, feeding 2-3 times per day, mucking stalls and paddocks, filling and cleaning water buckets, turning horses out and bringing them in, sweeping the yard etc. 
 Depending on your riding experience, you can of course also ride horses! If you are particularly interested in competition horses or show jumping, we will find a horse farm for you that suits your previous knowledge: You will learn how tournament horses are trained, you will get insights into how a farm runs and you can further develop your riding skills. Did you know that there are even stables in Ireland that run multi-day riding events at Olympic level? 
 Do you like horses, but are you less experienced in riding? Don’t worry! You will be a perfect match for one of our smaller riding stables, farms or horse-friendly families! Here you can contribute according to your experiences and interests and get practical experience in caring for horses and ponies. 
 The jobs are unpaid, but you will get free accommodation and meals from your workplace in exchange for your work. 
 Working in Ireland will not only allow you to travel abroad and get international experience, but you will also acquire practical skills that can be extremely valuable for your resume or your future studies / training, if you’re looking for a new equine or animal-related career! Another great side effect: while working in Ireland, you will improve your English skills by speaking the language in your daily life, i.e. with your local colleagues! 
 What are your working times? 
 You will work 5 days a week for about 40-45 hours and have 2 days off a week. Since there is always a lot to do on horse ranches, your days off do not necessarily fall on the weekends. If you work on the weekends, you will have days off during the week instead. 
 The exact working hours depend on your job and can vary - depending on the tasks to be done! Being flexible and a hands-on mentality are key skills if you would like to gain a foothold in the equine industry. 
 The jobs are available all year round and can be tailored to your individual needs! Let us know the areas that interest you the most (e.g. whether you are more interested in horse care or want to gain tournament experience) and we will match you with a job that perfectly fits your interests and skills! 
 What previous knowledge do you need? 
 Dealing with horses requires experience and a great deal of sensitivity. Applicants should therefore have at least 5 years of practical experience with horses, referring not so much to your riding skills, but more so to your confidence and experience in dealing with horses in general. Let us know as much as possible about your experience with horses and ideally also send us photos or videos that show you while riding or dealing with horses. The more information you give us about your previous experience, the better we can choose a ranch that perfectly matches your needs and interests!
