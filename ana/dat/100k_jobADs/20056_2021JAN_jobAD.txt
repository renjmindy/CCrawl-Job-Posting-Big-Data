 5 Reasons Why Stay-At-Home Parenting = Writing Success 
 18 Replies 
 I used to think I would have to wait for my children to grow up a bit before thinking about becoming a writer, but now I realize I'm exactly where I need to be. Here's why: 
 1. You will be desperate for a creative outlet 
 
 There are only so many lullabies you can sing and pretend cappuccinos you can sip before you start craving a use for your brain. Harness this hunger and write! 
 2. It 's the ideal set-up 
 
 If you were trying to write on weekends whilst working full-time, you might struggle to get yourself into the right frame of mind. If you took time off work to focus on your writing, you would have to face the unbearable pressure of producing something good and printable to validate your choice. When you're a stay-at-home-parent, you have the luxury of writing for fun. If you ever get to the point of writing something print-worthy, that's a bonus. 
 3. Writing time is precious 
 
 Let's face it: If I had all day to write, I would probably spend it drinking tea, flipping through Facebook, re-organising my shoe collection and staring at a blank page. As a stay-at-home-parent, writing time alone is a rare treat for me. I try to make the most of every second, whether the words are flowing or not. 
 4. There is a never-ending supply of writer 's block cures 
 
 I find the best antidote for blank-page-syndrome is menial work. Doing something boring with my hands frees up my brain to explore ideas. Fortunately, being a stay-at-home-parent provides me with an endless supply of these cures. I've chewed over writing while I'm doing the dishes, shopping for sausages, pegging out washing, changing nappies and buttering piles of sandwiches. 
 It works wonders. 
 5. You will be provided with a perfect abundance of material 
 
 Can you tell there's a squashed child under all those saucepans? Can you even tell they're meant to be saucepans?? 
 We all think we would write better if we could just go off to some cabin in the woods and be a hermit for a while. But I don't think it really works that way. Apart from the obvious homicidal-mania-related side effects (haven't you ever seen  The Shining ?), shutting yourself off from daily distraction would also mean shutting yourself off from a wealth of inspiration. If I didn't spend the bulk of my time making colossal mistakes as a parent, I would have nothing to write about. 
 So there you have it. I know you think you don't have time, but use what small pockets you can set aside. A lot of this can apply to other creative pursuits as well (just replace the word "writing" with "painting"/ "pottery"/ "international space-station design") 
 What do you think? Have I missed anything? Am I totally off my rocker? Tell me your thoughts in the comment section below.

 On Writing 
 29 Replies 
 
 Disclaimer: I suspect this is going to be an insufferably self-indulgent and introspective post. 
 Suffer. 
 I love writing. I get such a rush from words tumbling out and jostling for position on the screen or in my ratty notebook. There is a delicious agony in searching for the right word or the perfect one-liner. I am filled with glee when I finish a piece and it's done, it's definitely done and I can totally publish it. And knowing that I have readers as lovely as you is pure bliss. I think I know now what I want to be when I grow up. 
 And here's the funny part: I think that my job as a stay-at-home-mum fits perfectly with this plan. 
 I feel a little nervous saying this - in any other profession, it's perfectly OK to say you love working and that your job is full of fun perks, but the role of full-time Domestic Engineer is fraught with emotional landmines. 
 You see, we're all a little bruised by the idea put about that we're spoiled rich ladies who spend our days wearing pearls and watching infomercials. Or that we're a little bit stupid and child-care (being such an unworthy pursuit) is all our poor intellects are capable of. Or that we're so insufferably dull, we need to surround ourselves with children as a distraction. 
 This makes us rather defensive. 
 As a result, we flood social media with earnest posts about how SAHMs should be earning a CEO's salary for all the work they do (often accompanied by a Vishnu-like diagram depicting all the roles they play); stories of husbands who try to do the work of their stay-as-home wife and fall apart after Day 1 ("I had no idea!"); and heartwarming video clips that involve evocative piano music, baby's first steps and advertisements for a South East Asian phone company. 
 I feel like a traitor to the cause admitting I really like what I do - and not just for the worthy reasons like "being there for my kids" and "hearing Baby's first words" - the lifestyle really suits me. 
 I've been thinking a lot about a proper career as a writer and I see this time at home not as a delay or a roadblock, but as a gift. Time to practice and develop my skills before I try it on for real. 
 In fact, I've been thinking about it so much, I'm going to write a whole separate blog post about it. 
 Stay tuned.
