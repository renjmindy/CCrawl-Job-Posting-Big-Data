 On Job Interviews and Autism 
 I'm feeling burnt out again. My brain has the "stuffed with cotton wool" feeling that I haven't had for a while. I guess at this time of year, for religious Jews, things get rather fraught anyway, with so many  Yom Tovim  (festivals) in rapid succession. We had  Rosh Hashanah  (Jewish New Year) last week; on Sunday night and Monday is  Yom Kippur  (The Day of Atonement) and then at the end of the week is the start of the mammoth nine day festival of  Sukkot  (Tabernacles) and its semi-detached conclusion of  Shemini Atzeret  (the Eighth Day of Assembly) and  Simchat Torah  (the Rejoicing of the  Torah  ). I'm not getting up at 5.30am for  selichot  (penitential prayers) at the moment as I "should" be doing; I can only imagine what state I would be in if I were. At least after Monday the festivals will be less psychologically intense, with a focus on joy rather than on repentance, even if there is still a lot to do practically, although I have the "threat" of going back to  shul  (synagogue) in COVID times hanging over me, which I still do not feel comfortable about. 
 Because of  Shabbat  and  Yom Kippur  , I only have one full day to prepare for my job interview, and maybe an hour or so squeezed in amidst preparation on Sunday. To be honest, today I don't have much energy/will power for preparation. The interview schedule I was sent seems to indicate that they're only going to ask questions about my presentation, but that seemed unlikely, unless there's a second, more general, interview somewhere down the line, so I want to prepare for general questions. I feel that I'm not good at interviews any more. I had a lot of practise for them when I was at school, preparing for university applications, but I have gone rusty. With autism, it's hard to respond to questions in speech and without pause to consider, as would be permitted with a written test, and sometimes I just stop for several seconds (or longer) as my brain tries to get in gear. Sometimes the question doesn't even register properly first time around and I have to ask the interviewer to repeat it, another autistic trait. Other times I stumble over my words and don't sound too coherent, plus there's sometimes some thinking of good things to say after the interview is over. I don't know why it's thought that testing someone's ability to think and speak on their feet is a good test for how they will behave in a job that is largely written. To be fair, when I've had tests of my cataloguing ability lately I've done badly with them too, which does my self-esteem no good either. 
 I just feel negative about stuff today: interview, work, dating… I'm trying not to think about anything important, as it all just seems impossible. Not thinking about things seems safer than being relentlessly negative.

 Yep sometimes not thinking is best especially when you have prepared as best you can. It’s more in Gods hands then in yours. Enjoy your holidays :).

 It sounds like an extremely busy and stressful time with all the holidays. For me (for many reasons) December is a depressing month. Hoping for the best from the interview and glad that you are able to prepare a bit.

 It is very busy and stressful, although hopefully it will become somewhat more joyous after next week.

 Sending hugs 
Just wondering, do they know you think you're autistic? Because they should then make allowances…

 This has been something I've gone back and forth about in the last year or two. From a legal point of view, because I don't have a diagnosis yet, they don't legally have to make any adjustments for me. For a while I was telling potential employers anyway and seeing if they would make adjustments, but only one potential employer ever did (an institution that did psychological research into developmental disorders, go figure), but then I was advised by a careers advisor not to say anything about depression or autism until I have a firm job offer, otherwise they will just not offer me the job. It is difficult to know what the best strategy is…

 Emotionally, this is always an extra tough time of year for me, what with the HHD’s and the secular new year approaching. Sending caring and peaceful energy your way!
