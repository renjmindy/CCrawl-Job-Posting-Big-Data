 IS THIS YOU? 
Whether you call yourself a developer, coder, or engineer, you care about writing maintainable, scalable, well-documented code, and build for accessibility and performance. 
 You’re a problem-solver and a doer. Most at home when elbow-deep in code, you can also communicate clearly with less technical folks. A good communicator over Slack and video chat, working from home suits you nicely – and you have a decent internet connection. 
 Day-to-day, you welcome new challenges and can work on multiple projects. Comfortable with a level of autonomy – managing your own time and to-do list – you also enjoy talking-through ideas, and being an active  part of a team  focused on building the best possible websites. 
 You're fluent in spoken and written English, and you live – and have the right to work – in the UK. 
 === 
 JOB DESCRIPTION 
As well as helping to maintain existing websites, you’ll be building new responsive user interfaces – with semantic HTML, CSS, and JS – and wiring them into Craft CMS. 
 Additionally, you’ll: 
 
 Write tests and document the results 
 Diagnose and squish bugs 
 Write clear, useful technical documentation 
 Take part in code reviews 
 Keep up-to-date with relevant technologies, and approaches to work 
 Have an eye for design detail 
 
 Our front end stack includes:  Sass, Vue.js, Twig, Craft CMS, Gulp, Web Pack
