 Laura Smith-Proulx 
 March 07, 2011 
 Planning to apply to that hot job you just found online?  Take it a step further with some competitive research that can put you first in line (but at another company). Here’s the idea: when companies post a position,  they might be hiring from within their network  – looking at suppliers, competitors, vendors, and any other organizations within their sphere of influence for that perfect candidate. If they follow through on hiring from within this group of companies,  there's now a space to be filled  somewhere within this network. Here’s your cue: jump on this scenario, and send your resume to any of these other firms  BEFORE a job is posted, putting   yourself first in line  - before these companies realize someone is leaving! Find a hiring manager (using LinkedIn or Zoominfo), then add supporting detail to your cover letter that shows your research on the industry, and your interest in their specific operation. (This letter WILL be read in detail, because you're going to send it in hard copy, intriguing the manager enough to open it.) Next,  plan to follow up  in about a week by phone or via LinkedIn. Congratulations! You’ve just made a preemptive strike in your  job search ,  figured out how the hidden job market works, and probably generated sufficient interest  to win an interview.  Laura Smith-Proulx  is a resume expert & former recruiter who wins interviews for C-Suite leaders using powerful personal branding and resume strategies.  _** Read more »  articles by this **__ approved career expert | Click here » _ _  if you’re a career expert _  Photo credit: Shutterstock
