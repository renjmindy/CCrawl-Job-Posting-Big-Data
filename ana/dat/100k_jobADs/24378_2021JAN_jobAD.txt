  Does 'Luck' Exist In A Job Search?  
 Rosa Elizabeth Vargas 
 January 13, 2016 
 What is luck? How is it some job seekers seem to attract career opportunities easier than others who possess the same qualifications and the same job search tools? Is it really just luck? I think there is more to it and it begins with perspective.  Related: 7 Tips For Organizing A Messy Job Search  Discovering your luck is about expecting it, creating it, identifying when opportunity knocks at your door, following your gut instincts, taking risks, and looking at challenges from a position of power and not a victimized perspective. 
 
 Unlucky Job Seeker Statements 
 The economy is so tough. There are so many qualified people out there. Recruiters are mean to me! How could this be happening to me? I am worried this is going to take a long time. Can you cut me a resume deal since I really can’t afford it? How soon can I get back to you if my resume is not working? 
 Lucky Job Seeker Statements 
 Can’t wait to get this resume out there. I feel so much more confident now with this new resume. If I post this resume every day, I will be sure to get ahead of all the others. I will do everything I can to speed up this job search process. Coincidentally, I just reacquainted with my old colleague.  Do you see the distinction? Clue: attitude, expectation, energy, enthusiasm, and focus on the goal! Yes, these are very difficult times right now for many job seekers, but focusing on the challenges instead of on ways to overcome them is not going to change your luck or attract the right employment. 
 Make Your Own Luck 
 Allow me provide you with a few tips so you spark your good luck and begin to reverse your unfruitful job search. (Yes, practical steps for a totally magical transformation!) 
 1. Create A Job Search Road Map 
 Creating a job search plan is a pragmatic way to ignite your luck. A navigation tool with detailed action steps, a clear and defined job target, along with job search tools (resume, cover letter, reference list, thank-you/follow-up letter, job search methods, networking strategies, and an online presence). Luck favors the  prepared  , they say. 
 2. Be Flexible And Take Risks 
 While a plan is in order, don’t employ a tunnel vision. Work toward your plan but remain open to the idea that there may be something else or another way of getting to your ultimate goal. Consider temporary assignments or even relocating if need be. Change industries; try a different side of the coin. 
 3. Be Observant And Curious 
 Come up for air occasionally and notice others. While you network be present for the other person and see if you can assist. When you focus on only what you can gain, you actually fail to notice wonderful opportunities that are right under your nose. Investigate further on leads that may not seem so attractive at first - you really don't know where they may lead you. 
 4. Expect To Win 
 Self talk if you must, but bank on your success and not your failure. Practice saying, “  Once I have my job, I will.”  This is not new age nonsense. This really is a great way to motivate yourself. I know that by the time you finish reading this post you will feel more positive. (See. I just practiced it.) Last, when things seem to not go your way, make a lemon margarita!
