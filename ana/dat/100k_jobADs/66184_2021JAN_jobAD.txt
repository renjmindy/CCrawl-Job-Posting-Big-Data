 Great Job at a Fabulous Magazine in a Wonderful City! 
 It's no secret that I absolutely love  The Sun  magazine , so I'm happy to spread the word about this job: 
 "We need a Digital-Media Director at  The Sun  , a nonprofit, ad-free magazine in its thirty-sixth year of publication. Duties include directing  The Sun 's  digital-media efforts; writing and editing online copy; recommending and producing digital formats for magazine and book content; producing e-mail ad campaigns; and overseeing  The Sun 's  computer network. The job requires editorial and/or project-management experience (preferably in an online environment), a thorough understanding of social media, and HTML skills. This is a full-time position in our editorial office in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. No phone calls, e-mails, faxes, or surprise visits, please." 
 More details here.
