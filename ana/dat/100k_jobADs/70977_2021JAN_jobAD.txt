  3 Oddly Simple Ways To Get Your Dream Job  
 Ryan Niessen 
 June 30, 2014 
 We all have an idea about how to create success in our lives. But what if there was an easier way to get what we want - that’s totally different from what we’ve been taught?  Related: The Lazy Job Seeker’s Guide To Getting A Dream Job  Well, in this article, I put together three oddly simple (and very unique) perspectives from well-known, successful people. This isn’t your average job seeking wisdom. You may love it… and you may hate it. But if you’re looking for something better, then the missing tidbit you need might be right here. Plus, as a small bonus for being the success-minded individual you are, I’m going to throw in a  free resource at the bottom of this article . It’ll help you figure out and take the next step towards your dream job. 
 
 The 3 Oddly Simple Ways To Get Your Dream Job 
 So without further ado, here are the three oddly simple ways to get your dream job: 
 1. Changing Your Perspective 
 Here’s a quote from a letter the famous TV star, Mike Rowe, of  Dirty Jobs,  wrote to a fan that was asking for advice on finding a job that made him happy: 
 
 Stop looking for the “right” career, and start looking for a job. Any job. Forget about what you like. Focus on what’s available. Get yourself hired. Show up early. Stay late. Volunteer for the scut work. Become indispensable. You can always quit later, and be no worse off than you are today. But don’t waste another year looking for a career that doesn’t exist. And most of all, stop worrying about your happiness. Happiness does not come from a job. It comes from knowing what you truly value, and behaving in a way that’s consistent with those beliefs. Many people today resent the suggestion that they’re in charge of the way the feel. But trust me. Those people are mistaken. That was a big lesson from Dirty Jobs, and I learned it several hundred times before it stuck. What you do, who you’re with, and how you feel about the world around you, is completely up to you. 
 
 Personally, I have no interest in finding “any job." I’d rather put some serious thought into my strengths, values, and passions, and then choose the best looking job from there. I do, however, love Mike’s point about being in charge of the way you feel, and your results in life. Ultimately, no one’s going to give you your dream job, and they’re not going to “make” you feel unhappy. It’s up to you to create experiences, relationships, and a career that you find fulfilling. So, what do you think? Might a change in perspective help your career, and help you create your dream job? 
 2. Finding The Love In What You Do 
 Sometimes, it’s impossible to change your career in the present moment. You might have a family to support, or other obligations to uphold - and you just have to stick with a job you don’t really like. In this case, there are essentially two options. You can continue on as you are, grit your teeth, and battle through it for the foreseeable future. Of course, the danger here is that it never gets better, or even gets worse. The 2nd option is inspired by the following quote from one of my favorite authors, Dan Millman, author of the  The Way of the Peaceful Warrior  , which is now a major motion picture. 
 
 “A warrior does not give up what he loves, he finds the love in what he does.” 
 
 You have the ability, while taking small steps every day, to create a better future, to find the love in what you do. Pay attention to what you’re doing, without considering the end goal. Focus on the process… the movements, and look for things that you enjoy. Like Mike Rowe said above, you have the power to control your feelings, and create happiness now. 
 3. Saying, 'Screw It, Let’s Do It' 
 This is the title of Richard Branson’s bestselling book, and unsurprisingly, one of his famous sayings. It’s a fairly self-explanatory concept. If you feel like it’s time for a change… screw it, just do it. If you’ve had something on your mind that you’ve been wanting to do… screw it, just do it. This carefree, fun approach to life and your career seems like the perfect way to end this article. But before you go, don’t forget your  bonus resource … it’s a  free video sharing 3 solid job-seeking tips  you can apply today to take the next step towards your “dream job." It shares the wisdom of my good friend and mentor… the same wisdom that helped me get my dream job years ago. So, go ahead and  check it out , or leave a comment with some thoughts below. What are you waiting for? Screw it, just do it.
