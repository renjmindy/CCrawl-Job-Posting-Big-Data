  Is Google Plus Good for Your Career?  
 J.T. O'Donnell 
 July 24, 2012 
 Google+  is a web-based platform where you create a profile page (a.k.a. your Google+ page) and then use it to share information and connect with people from all over the world. Sounds like every other social networking website, right? Wrong. In my opinion, Google+ has taken all the best features and functions from well-known social media tools (i.e. Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Skype, etc.) and built a one-stop-shop you can use to manage all your personal and professional relationships. In short, it’s the Wal-Mart of social networking! So the question is, "With all the other social tools out there, should you bother using  Google+ for your career ?" My answer... YES! I believe Google+ is the easiest platform to showcase your unique expertise which means this is a "must-use" tool for any professional. I built an e-guide called, "5 Steps to Becoming a Google+ Powerhouse" and I want you to have it for FREE. Oh, and along with that PDF I also provide a five-part video series that expands on each step. Cool, huh? All I ask is you subscribe to CAREEREALISM so you can receive our daily tips (via e-mail) for building a better career. (Current subscribers can still acquire this resource. You will not receive duplicate daily messages.) Use the button below to get your complimentary copy now!  FREE DOWNLOAD ►   Image Credit: Shutterstock
