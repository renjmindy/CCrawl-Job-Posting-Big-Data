 Regulatory Business Analyst 
 12 month FTC 
 £50,000 - £60,000 + benefits 
 Based in North Birmingham 
 My client, a FTSE 250 listed business is looking to recruit a Business Analyst for a 12 month FTC. Following new guidelines and the introduction of FCA regulation across part of the business there is a need for an experienced BA to join the team to help get them fully FCA compliant. 
 The project to get them compliant started three months ago when a Project Manager was hired to broadly scope the requirements and now that has been done they are looking to get into the detail hence the need for BA now. 
 Ideally you will have experience of working in a highly regulated industry and in an FCA specific regulated environment. You will have a good appreciated of financial services, ICOBS, insurance and ideally will have worked in an Agile environment. 
 Initially the role will be done remotely however there is a desire to get people back to the office safely in the near future so ideally you will already be Midlands based. I am looking for someone to start as soon as possible so please don't hesitate to apply. I will endeavour to get in touch with all suitable applications within 3 business days. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
