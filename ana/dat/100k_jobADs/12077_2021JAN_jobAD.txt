 A National Survey of Former Educators Shows that Life After Teaching Is Pretty, Pretty Good. 
 If you want to know that life after teaching can get better, don't just take my word for it. Though my quality of life has gone up in  big ways  and  small  after leaving teaching, how likely is that to happen on average? 
 The National Center on Education Statistics addresses this question in its new  Teacher Follow-Up Survey . Researchers asked 2,600 former public school teachers to rate aspects of their current jobs as better than, worse than, or about the same as teaching. 
 The results? 
 Out of 20 job measures, not a single one was rated as "better in teaching." 
 Sure, the results could be biased because the participants may not have liked teaching much in the first place, or may have been worse than average at their jobs. On top of that, who wants to admit they've made the wrong life choices? 
 And yet I suspect that -- just like many of this blog's readers -- a large number of these so-called "public teacher leavers" did care and did work hard. But they changed careers to take better care of themselves and their families -- and the gamble paid off. 
 Some of the benefits of life after teaching might seem obvious: 
 **Salary 
**It's no secret that teachers often make less than other college graduates. And indeed, about 44 percent of teacher leavers said they were paid more in their jobs after teaching, compared to just under 20 percent who said they were paid more as teachers. These findings support a recent  Center for American Progress survey on low teacher pay I  previously wrote about . 
 **Influence over Workplace Policies and Practices 
**Nearly 59 percent of former teachers said their current jobs allowed them to have more of a voice at work, compared to just 8 percent who said they had more influence as teachers. That's a gap of more than 50 percentage points -- the largest of all 20 categories in the survey. 
 **Ability to Balance Personal Life and Work 
**This might be the one teachers who want to leave need to hear most. And yes, a good 61 percent of leavers said their work-life balance had improved -- the biggest consensus on how life after teaching gets better. Compare that to just about 13 percent who said they had better balance in teaching, and some 26 percent who said the balance was about the same. 
 Other perks of life after teaching may surprise you: 
 **Benefits 
** Republican   politicians  and a large portion of the general public like to dump on the "Cadillac" benefits teachers get, like relatively low-cost health insurance and ( shrinking ) pensions. And some teachers may hesitate to leave teaching for fear of losing these benefits. 
 But nearly 65 percent of leavers said the benefits in their new jobs were about as good as they were in teaching. Personally, I'm among the nearly 26 percent of leavers whose benefits are actually better now. 
 **Job Security 
**Job protections like tenure are  another popular target  for those who feel that teachers just have it too good. 
 Yet nearly 57 percent of leavers felt the security of their current jobs was about the same as it was in teaching, and some 18 percent felt they had more job security in their current positions. 
 **Recognition and Support From Administrators/Managers 
**I've written about how  dissatisfaction with school administration often influences teachers' decisions to quit . But I can also see how teachers might avoid changing careers for fear that management will be even worse in the "real" world. 
 But it might not be that bad, according to the survey: nearly 88 percent of teacher leavers rated their managers as either better (44.9 percent), or similar (42.6 percent) to those they had in teaching. 
 **Opportunities to Make a Difference in the Lives of Others 
**This might be one of the strongest barriers to teachers who might otherwise leave. Despite all their frustrations with teaching, they just don't think any other job could be as rewarding. But the survey shows that people can, and do, find new ways to help others: more than 44 percent of leavers said their current position allowed them to make more of an impact than teaching did, and about 31 percent felt they were making as much impact as they did teaching. 
 Overall, more than half of those who left teaching said their working conditions had improved. As  Larry David would say , that's pretty, pretty good! 
 Teachers and former teachers, what do  you  find most important in a job and how does your current work measure up?
