 Help Me 
 Posted on  May 28, 2015  by   CDC 
 
I need your help. 
 I make about $560 a month through SSDI. I can't get a regular job because I smoke weed, which saves me at least $200/month in medication costs and helps with my dance disposition. I live in my ex-husband's house for free with my kids, but believe me, I pay for that in other ways. 
 I DONT WANT  YOUR  MONEY! 
 I want you to help me with ideas for how to make money. I dance around town, have ad space available, which can go freely in and out of stores or anything. People consistently tell me they see me everywhere, my ad space is valuable, but so far no one has taken advantage of that fact, by paying me to wear their brand name or drink their soda in public or whatever. 
 I could be a very useful marketing tool, and that's what I want to get paid for. 
 Now, there will be critics who say the companies that sponser me are exploiting my disability. I want to say very clearly right now that: 
 I AM ALREADY EXPLOITING MY DISABILITY! 
 I'm a cripple. Before the acceptance and recognition of the beauty of it, people stared at or avoided me or seemed to feel sorry for me because I'm in a wheelchair. Now people definitely stare, but it is not out of pity.  I love it, and want people to stare and smile and laugh and talk to me. 
 When I actually accepted all of this, I recognized the privileges of being who I am. 
 I am fortunate to be able to change the world by being myself, just sitting in a chair and dancing and making people smile. It is an honor. 
 I am taking advantage of my position by dancing around town with positive signs on my chair and making people smile. 
 Unfortunately that part doesn't pay the bills. 
 I need help to get some form of either sponsorship, or advertising revenue, or something. 
 If you see me somewhere dancing, please help by dancing. I've started giving my cards to construction workers and mail people and asking them and everyone else to dance when they see me dancing; but soon I will have to make money while doing this, or I'm going to have to stop.

 Trifextra: Blaze of Glory 
 Posted on  March 23, 2012  by   CDC

 This weekend's  Trifextra  is  community-judged . 
 
 For the 12 hours following the close of the challenge, voting will be enabled on links. 
 Come back to this post to vote. 
 Voting is open to everyone. 
 Encourage your friends to vote for you, if you wish, but please don't tell them to vote on a number. The numbering of the posts changes regularly, as authors have the ability to delete their own links at any time. 
 Due to the limitations (our opinion) of our linking service, you are unable to vote on a post from the same device from which it was submitted. You will have to find another way to vote for yourself, and we hope you do. 
 This week, in an attempt to break the massive ties that we have seen in the past, we are allowing you to vote on your  top three  favorite posts. 
 Yes, you really only have 12 hours to vote. We'll send out reminders on Twitter and Facebook. 
 
 For your prompt this week, we are giving you the  first  33 words of a story. You need to complete it with  33 of your own words . 
 
 “There’s nothing cute about it,” he said. The register of his voice indicated decision more so than discussion. 
 She disagreed heartily and privately, staring past his head and out the window behind him. 
 She couldn’t look at  him  without laughing. She had known she would be fired soon anyway; might as well go out in a blaze of glory. Behind her the room erupted in laughter.
