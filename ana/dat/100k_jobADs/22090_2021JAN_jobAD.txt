 As a global manufacturer of Industrial Heat Exchange and Evaporation systems for a diverse and international market, this leading organisation is in a state of growth and expansion across many of their operations. 
As such, they now require the appointment of an additional Electrical Engineering Project Manager for one of their key divisions based in Europe. The role can be based in the UK or Europe and will be home based with up to 60% travel on an international basis with clients in; Asia, USA, South Africa and Scandinavia amongst many other locations, so travel will play a key part of this role. 
 The Electrical Project Manager will use their know-how to advise in the planning and implementation of customer projects from design and development through to delivery, installation and commissioning on site and hand over to the customer. 
You will program PLC controls for our products and visualise with TIA Portal (or Step7 ) or WinCC. This includes data acquisition and storage of process data from the plants - including reporting and you will diagnose errors and develop suitable solutions to resolve any customer issues. You will also plan and create circuit diagrams for the construction of the control cabinets and provide support during the commissioning of process engineering plants and test and optimise automation processes on projects. 
 The ideal individual will have a strong Electrical Engineering background and will be well versed in customer project management of some kind of Heat Exchange or Evaporation systems in an industrial type environment such as; chemical, plant engineering and the food and beverage industries. 
 You will be well versed in Siemens PLC programming and fault finding and will understand the use of TIA Portal along with any knowledge of ABB controls would be a distinct advantage in this global role. You must be able to travel for extended periods in this role and to be self motivated and sufficient when away on site in order to get the job done and keep the customers satisfaction as the highest priority. 
 You will be based from home and travel to Germany when needed and so this role offers great flexibility for the right person. Coupled with a very strong remuneration package and future career development opportunity for those seeking this advancement.
