  How To Answer "Why Are You Interested In This Job?"  
 Jenna Arcand 
 March 19, 2020 
 A common interview question employers ask during job interviews is, "Why are you interested in this position?" They want to know why you want to work at their company, and the specific motivation behind why you applied for the job (not that you need a paycheck). 
 
 Knowing  how to answer interview questions  well is always important, especially with this question. 
 To persuade the employer that you have a true connection to the company and a passion for the job you applied for, your answer to this interview question should start with, "I'm interested in this job, at this company, because…" and then list at least three reasons why you want to work there. 
 Here is how you should structure your answer to the interview question, "Why are you interested in this job?" 
 Reason #1 – Professional Fit 
 Your first reason should always show fit in terms of  professional skills . 
 Example:  "I'm interested in this job because I can see that, in this role, my skills could help solve this problem within your company. I also see an opportunity for me to learn and grow these skills, so we both would benefit personally, professionally, and financially. If I can come in here and solve problems and accomplish your goals, I know I can develop my career the way that I want to." 
 This part of your answer lets them know that you are excited about what you will be able to accomplish for them, while still emphasizing what they are getting out of the bargain. You need to sell yourself as a business-of-one who can provide a service better than the competition. 
 Reason #2 – Cultural Fit 
 Your second reason when answering, "Why are you interested in this job?" also shows fit, but in a different way. 
 Example:  "Also, I like the culture of this organization. From what I've heard and what I've been reading about the company, it seems like a great fit for my personality and my values. I really connect with your mission statement, and feel passionate about the work that you do." 
 This is a general answer, so if you can be more specific by actually naming a couple of things you've heard or read about the company's workplace culture that you like, it will help your cause. This is one area where your pre-interview research is critical. 
 Here are a few things you may want to look for when you  research the company : 
 
 Is this a top company in the field/industry? 
 Is this company known for cutting-edge products or other innovations? 
 Does this company have a great reputation for customer service? 
 Is this company known for being a  great place to work ? 
 Does this company value and/or provide resources for employee development? 
 
 Mention those things that truly speak to you and your values so your sincerity shows. 
 Reason #3 – Personal Fit 
 Wrap up your answer to this interview question with something that personalizes it a bit more. 
 Examples: 
 
 "And, this job is in a great location for me. I've always wanted to move here." 
 "And, this job is only five minutes from my house, so eliminating the commute is a big plus." 
 "And, I've always used your products, and I just love them. I am really excited about being a part of that." 
 
 Say something that gives you another reason of your own for wanting this job.  This interview answer is a fantastic place to let your enthusiasm for the job  show.  It's very appealing to employers, and it gives them one more reason to hire you.
