 Cristiano Ronaldo Scores 700 Career goal 
 Cristiano Ronaldo   cannot stop breaking records, and he added another on Friday night by bagging his 700th career goal against Ukraine. 
 Ronaldo reached the sensational milestone with a clinical penalty but he and his team-mates were unable to find an equaliser against the 10 men of Ukraine. 
 The 34-year-old has scored more career goals than any other active player in professional football, edging the 672 amassed by his former La Liga adversary Lionel Messi. 
 This season, Ronaldo has scored 11 goals from 12 appearances for club and country, having scored four for Portugal during a 5-1 win over Lithuania in the European Qualifiers last month. 
 Incredibly, he scored in excess of 50 goals for eight successive seasons between 2010/11 and 2017/18, before netting 31 last term after his summer switch from Real Madrid to Juventus. 
 In fact, the Juventus forward has now scored 95 goals for his country, just 14 fewer than his tally for Manchester United over six seasons under Sir Alex Ferguson. 
 But the bulk of his incredible haul came after his £80m move from Old Trafford in 2009, when he proceeded to score 450 goals in a Madrid shirt during a nine-year spell at the club. 
 In addition to being lethal from range, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner poses equal threat in the air from closer range with 127 headed goals to date - just two shy of the number he's scored with his left boot. 
 He is now the sixth player to achieve that will he be able to surpass Pele's goal scoring record?!
