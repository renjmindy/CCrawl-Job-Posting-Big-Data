 About Community Phone Company 
 We make it easy for people to leave their cable bundle by providing a one-stop-shop for everything they'd need to get: wireless, landline, cloud communication, internet referral. 
 We have built software that predicts future data usage to optimize buying from the underlying carriers, a business cloud communication system that does not require a username or password or new software for the end user to learn, and a U.S. based team of friendly and hardworking support people who are there to answer our customers' calls. 
 About the role 
 Skills:  CSS, HTML, JavaScript 
 About Us 
 Community Phone is the first software-enabled nationwide phone carrier. We have built software that allows us to do things other phone companies cannot do, such as making the analog landline digital for the first time and allowing it to do brand new things, predicting usage to optimize gigabyte economics, providing home internet using fixed wireless, and more. We were part of YC W19, and our backers include the founder of Twitch, the founder of Figma, and early Stripe employees. 
 About You 
 Deep familiarity with Javascript, CSS, and HTML. Curiosity about marketing funnels and deep UTM tracking. You will work with our backend developer. Bonus points if you are interested in learning about voice engineering or know React.
