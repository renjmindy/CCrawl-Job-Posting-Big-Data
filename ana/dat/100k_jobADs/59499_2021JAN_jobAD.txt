 This Changes Everything ~ A Cento Poem 
 Empty manger perfect stranger, about to be born, into darkness sadness 
 Des'prate madness, creation is so torn, we were so lost on earth 
 Warm hay cold sweat, a mother not yet, praying God-speed the dawn 
 She looks to her man, holding her hand, they wonder how long 
 They did not find a palace, just a humble village home and searching for a King 
 Lowly and small, the weakest of all, unlikeliest hero wrapped in His mother's shawl 
 But finding a Child, no crown, no throne, still they bowed down 
 Expectation turned to mystery 
 For nothing was like anything they'd dreamed 
 It's still a mystery to me 
 That the Hands of God could be so small 
 How tiny fingers reachin' in the night 
 Were the very hands that measure the sky 
 Still a mystery to me 
 How His infant eyes had seen the dawn of time 
 How His ears had heard an angel symphony 
 Just a Child, is this who we've waited for 
 'Cause how many kings stepped down from their thrones 
 How many lords have abandoned their homes 
 How many greats have become the least for me 
 And how many gods have poured out their hearts 
 To romance a world that has torn all apart 
 How many fathers gave up their sons for me 
 That the King would come for us, this changes everything 
 A Baby born to save, to save the souls of man 
 Born that we may have life 
 You were born that we may have life 
 A throne in a manger, a cross in a cradle 
 The hidden revealing this glorious plan 
 Of the child who would suffer, the child who would conquer 
 The sin of every woman, the sin of every man 
 And the world didn't know, mercy was meek and so mild 
 And the world didn't know, that truth was as pure as a child 
 And the world didn't know, redemption was sweet and so strong 
 And the world didn't know, salvation was writing a song 
 That the King would come for us, this changes everything
