 Manage the Engineering Team at Coda Protocol 
 Role overview 
 Weâ€™re developing Coda Protocol, a cryptocurrency that compresses the blockchain from hundreds of gigabytes down to the size of a few tweets. It can scale to thousands of transactions per second and millions of users while remaining so decentralized even old cellphones can act as fully verifying nodes. Weâ€™re seeking a technical engineering manager who can prioritize and collaborate across diverse engineering disciplines, while remaining an empathetic and caring mentor to engineers with diverse perspectives. 
 Engineering managers will: 
 
 Provide empathetic leadership and impactful mentoring 
 Contribute to the project technically (as an estimated percent of time, perhaps 30% engineering and 70% management) 
 
 This is a chance to join and guide a small, collaborative team and have a ton of independence while working on fascinating cross-disciplinary problems that span cryptography, programming languages, functional programming, networking, and traditional product engineering. We also offer competitive compensation both in salary and equity as well as top-of-the-market benefits. 
 Ideal candidates will be interested in: 
 
 Technical leadership 
 Mentorship 
 Cryptography 
 Distributed systems 
 Functional programming 
 
 There are no hard requirements and weâ€™re more interested in learning about your individual background.
