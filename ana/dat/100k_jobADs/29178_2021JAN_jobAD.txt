  Nightmare Job Interviews, Had One?!  
 Work It Daily 
 April 21, 2011 
 Our friend Amy-Levin Epstein over at On the Job recently posted some pretty  horrifying stories of job interviews  that were downright terrible. The upside is if we pay attention, we can usually learn something valuable from these situations...well, most of the time! It also made us wonder,  How many of our readers have had bad interview experiences like these?  [poll id="16"]  Now, share with us what happened and what you learned!  In the comments below, tell us what went down and what it taught you. Job-it-forward by helping your fellow readers prepare for the worst in their upcoming interviews!  Sharing could help you win a FREE Interview Prep Session!  If we select your story to be on our show " Career Reality TV " on Friday, April 29, you'll get a private Interview Prep Session with our Founder, J.T. O'Donnell. So, don't hold back. Give us the scoop and you could be rewarded! You can tweet your answer too - just use the  #CareerBG  hashtag if you do!   Post Your Choice on Twitter »
