 It's Veterans and Military Families Month. And all this month, WorkingNation is taking a look at some of the challenges veterans and military spouses have when it comes to finding and keeping a good civilian job. 
 More than 200,000 men and women transition out of the military each year. For many, their job in the service is the first job they've ever had. 
 "There are certain things that they have never done. They've never created a civilian resume. They've never networked to try to find a civilian job. They've never interviewed with a behavioral style interview. They've never gone through negotiation on what their salary would be. They don't know what a 401k is. They probably have never been had an HR department. They have a gap in knowledge." 
 That's  Christopher Plamp , CEO of  Hire Heroes USA , and my guest on this episode of  Work in Progress . 
 We had a chance to discuss how his veteran-serving organization is working to fill the knowledge gap and better prepare veterans for their entry into civilian work life. We also examined the differences between younger veterans and older veterans when it comes to preparing for their move out of the military and training for new skills needed in today's workforce. 
 We hope you enjoy the conversation.
