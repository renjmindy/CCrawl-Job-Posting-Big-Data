 Snoop Dogg and Jared Leto Join the Reddit Fray; Jobs They are Aplenty; Soda Delivery Right to Your Door

 Reddit already?

 Reddit, the website billed as "The Front Page of the Internet" is itself making headlines for having raised $50 million in funding. Of course, the usual Silicon Valley suspects whipped out their wallets to get a piece of the Reddit action but they weren't the only ones. Hip-hop icon Snoop Dogg and oh-so-pretty-Oscar-winning-actor Jared Leto wanted in on the Reddit pie too. Reddit, whose content leaves some tongues wagging and other tongues gagging, plans on using that $50 million for all sorts of neat things like hiring more staff, improving its mobile offerings and, of course, ads. Reddit CEO Yishan Wong also has big convoluted plans to give back 10% - in money, that is - to the users who so valiantly scourge the internet to find the right stories that drive the traffic which entertains and sometimes horrifies its visitors. However Wong fully admits "that this plan could tally fail." Totally. We mustn't forget to mention that unfortunate incident when nude celebrity photos were leaked onto the site. Many thought the leak was extremely uncool. The site was launched back in 2004 and boasts 133 million users. 
 Sweet September…

 Just in case you were feeling bummed about the economy, because I know that was your first thought when you woke up this morning, then here's some good news. According to Automatic Data Processing aka ADP, aka those three letters that help decorate your paycheck, just released new data telling us that 213,000 jobs were added in the month of September. That marks the sixth month in a row that job gains are up. It's especially good news since job gains over the 200,000 mark have a special little way of making the unemployment rate head a wee bit south. And these numbers are just from the private sector which, by the way, gained in all industries. Just wait till you see what numbers the public sector posts. Ooh. I can hardly stand the excitement. Now if the Bureau of Labor Statistics would graciously back up those numbers then all would be right with the world. Almost. Because less people are filing for jobless claims, which happen to be at a seven year low, more and more spending occurs, which leads to more and more economic growth, which leads to…well, you can figure it out from here. 
 Amazon quench…

 Thirsty? Then you better log onto Amazon. Quick. That is if you are jonesing for PepsiCo's latest beverage offering, PepsiTrue. What's true is that this drink can only be purchased, for now anyways, via the e-commerce website - in 24 packs. What is also true is that it still has calories in it, except 30% less of them. As for the hotly contested high-fructose corn syrup and artificial sweeteners? Those ingredients have been scrapped as a way to win back Millenials who seem to prefer beverages sans those items and have been shifting away from soda for the last several years. And, by initially selling the product on Amazon, PepsiCo, apparently, will be able to gauge the response for the new cola. Now can someone tell me what PepsiCo would have done if this were 1984? Anyone?
