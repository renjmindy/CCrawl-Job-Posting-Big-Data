 Restaurant workers can face serious on-the-job injuries 
 On behalf of John Lesaganich, P.C., Attorney at Law  | Jul 27, 2018 | Uncategorized 
 According to literature promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, restaurant workers can face a number of serious and job-threatening  injuries  while performing their duties of employment. Illinois residents who work in the restaurant industry may be interested to know that their work-related harm may make them eligible to seek workers' compensation. The remainder of this post will discuss the types of injuries restaurant workers commonly suffer and how those injuries may keep them from working. 
 One of the most common restaurant industry injuries for workers is strains. Strains can affect different muscle groups in victims' bodies. As restaurant workers may be asked to lift heavy objects, reach and carry trays and food to patrons and perform other physically difficult tasks it is not hard to understand how strains may be introduced into their bodies. 
 Additionally, common injuries like cuts and burns are not unusual in restaurants. Workers who prepare food are asked to work around hot equipment like ovens and burners and can easily cause damage to their bodies if they come into contact with those heat sources. Cuts from knives and other equipment may plague restaurant workers who must rush to prepare meals and keep their kitchens moving during heavy meal rushes. 
 When a worker is affected by a strain, cut or burn they may not be able to go back to work right away. They may believe that their injury was caused by the negligence of their employer and they may need help to get through their period of recuperation.  Workers' compensation  may benefit restaurant workers who are unable to do their jobs because of injuries.
