 Statewide Virtual Job Fair 
 
 The next Statewide Virtual Job Fair is right around the corner,  December 8-10, 2020 . 
 Job seekers, if you are searching for a new career path and want to connect with several high-level organizations in the Kansas City metro area, please visit  KansasWorks Virtual Job Fair . Please take the time to create a profile and upload your resume as this will allow employers to see your work experience before you speak with them. If you have questions about a specific job or company, take advantage of the text-chat feature to speak with employers in real-time. To register for the event, visit the  Statewide Virtual Job Fair registration page . 
 Employers, if you are searching for high-quality talent to add to your organization, please join the next job fair. If you require more information or have a question, please email Roberta Rowland with Workforce Partnership at  RobertaR@workforcepartnership.com . 
 Frequently Asked Questions: 
 
 
 Who should attend? 
 
 
 Job seekers looking for entry-level to mid-level employment opportunities. 
 
 
 
 Does a job seeker have to re-register for each job fair? 
 
 
 NO! Only one registration process is required. Once they are registered they will receive an email reminder for each job fair. 
 They receive an email each day the job fair is live. 
 
 
 
 What is needed to participate in our Virtual job fair? 
 
 
 A computer with internet access, or a smartphone with internet access, and a resume! 
 
 
 
 How many employers will be there? 
 
 
 Currently, we have 80 employers in Area 3 who have said they will be participating in the job fair. They are listed at the bottom of this email. Keep in mind this list will most likely change before the event goes live. 
 
 
 
 Why should someone attend a virtual job fair? 
 
 
 
 
 COVID has changed recruiting. Most Employers can no longer do in-person events. Many of them are no longer doing in-person interviews. 
 
 
 This is a great way to find employers who are serious about hiring and looking for new talent! 
 
 
 Online applications are still an empty black hole, but this allows job seekers the ability to text chat- interact with employers and meet employers who are serious about hiring. 
 
 
 
 
 
 How long does the job fair last? 
 
 
 It lasts for 3 days. 8 am – 5 pm. 
 
 
 
 How long does a job seeker need to be on the platform? 
 
 
 
 
 It’s up to each person to determine how much time they need to preview job openings, apply, and/or text chat with employers. 
 
 
 Job seekers might need as little as 30 minutes up to a couple of hours to successfully work the job fair. 
 
 
 Job seekers can log on any time during the 3 days of the job fair. 
 
 
 They can also log on multiple times and stay on as little or as much as they need to. It’s just like an in-person job fair, they can come and go as they wish. 
 
 
 Employers set their schedule when they are available for text chat. Not all Employers are not available for chat at the same time. 
 
 
 Job seekers should check the employer’s booth to see when they are available if they want to text chat. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Did I mention there is NO video or speakers required for this platform? 
 
 
 
 
 It’s an interactive web page that’s simple to navigate. 
 
 
 Employers do have the option to upload videos for job seekers to learn more about their company.  Most have not done this. 
 
 
 However, it’s not necessary for a job seeker to watch a video to participate in the event. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Do job seekers and employers see each other? 
 
 
 NO! The chat feature is a  text chat function . Similar to texting on a phone/or talking to help chat on a website. 
 
 
 
 Does the job seeker need earphones to participate? 
 
 
 Only if they want to watch a video the employer has posted. Speakers/earphones are not required. 
 
 
 
 Do the job seeker and employer need zoom or other social platforms to participate? 
 
 
 NO!  It’s accessing a web page where they have received a link to participate. 
 
 
 
 Employers might invite job seekers to leave the Virtual Job Fair platform and participate in a private zoom interview meeting. 
 
 
 The job seeker would need to request a phone interview if they do not have this capability on their smartphone or home computer. 
 
 
 
 Where does a job seeker apply? 
 
 
 An employer might include a link to their company’s career page and on-line application process. OR they might encourage them to apply after they do a brief text chat interview. 
 
 
 
 What does a job seeker see when they log in? 
 
 
 They see logos of the employers who are participating. These are the Employer booths. The job seeker clicks on the booth to see job openings and other important information. They can then type a text chat with the employer. They can “text chat” to ask questions like what time does the shift start? Do you know if you are close to a bus stop? The same type of questions they would ask during an in-person Job fair. 
 
 
 
 Do you want to check out the next Virtual Job fair for yourself just to see what it’s like? 
 
 
 PLEASE DO! Just like in-person job fairs, it’s okay to create a job seeker profile and move about in the platform to experience it for ourselves. It’s also helpful to be able to assist job seekers or explain how simple and easy it is to use.  The pre-registration link is in the virtual job fair graphic.  It only takes a couple of quick minutes to register. 
 
 
 
 How will the Statewide Virtual Job Benefit me? 
 
 
 As a job seeker, this is a great way for someone in one part of the state to job hunt for a job in another part of the state. Especially if they are being relocated! Consider military families who are moving, a traveling spouse could access this virtual job fair in Arizona and seek employment in Kansas before they complete their move. 
 Employers will have the opportunity to connect with high-level talent across the state. They can create one booth and have it visible in different state areas on the platform.
