 Why Work-Life Spanish? 
People study, learn and practice, and attend events with Work-Life Spanish because they want to immerse themselves in this vibrant and colorful language and culture. People come to us full of desires to vacation abroad somewhere warm and sunny, engage with friends and loved ones, seek out new adventures, shake their hips, or simply enjoy life through food, music, dance and gathering. 
 Work-Life Spanish helps community members fulfill those goals in the DC metro area and online. We rescue members from the solitude of apps or impersonal overcrowded classes and immerse them in a unique learning experience. Our courses and events connect people in order to create a bi-lingual community that deepens members' roots to Spain and Latin America.
