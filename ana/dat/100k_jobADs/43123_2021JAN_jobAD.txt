 3 YouTube Channels Every Actor Needs to Subscribe to

 YouTube is a great tool for learning new things, getting the inside scoop on your industry and finding out what's going on with your fellow actors. 
 Whether you yourself have a YouTube channel or not, you should make the most of it. So we've rounded up 3 great channels that'll get you started into your YouTube foray. 
 1. Backstage 
 Backstage has over 50k subscribers already - and it's easy to see why. With a selection of acting tips, insider info from casting directors and one-on-ones with agents, you can spend days going down this rabbit hole of information. 
 Just keep a notepad and pen at the ready to jot down any great new ideas! 
 
 2. Tips on Acting 
 Run by Amy Jo Berman, who spent 20 years as a casting director and former VP of casting at HBO, she posts videos that answer a whole bunch of questions from the wider acting community. 
 Her mission is to take the "struggling" out of "struggling actor" - if that sounds good to you, you can find her channel below! 
 
 3. Act on This - The TV Actor's Network 
 This YouTube channel is run by Ross Grant, a very enthusiastic Brit who has pulled together an online community of TV actors and populates his Vlog with a series of videos on what you need to know about the acting business and how to pay your bills using acting (and just acting!) 
 A bit of a newer blog, but with over 1k subscribers already, surely one to watch! 
 
 Happy watching!
