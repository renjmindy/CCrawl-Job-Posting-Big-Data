 Severa Alarcon, 
 To apply for the said caregiver jobs abroad Israel, you need to personally apply to the recruiting agency. Since you are in Hong Kong, I think that applying for the said caregiver jobs abroad Israel would be impossible. But there is one recruitment agency in Canada that is continuously looking for qualified caregiver jobs applicants who are currently in Hong Kong. Just visit the website nannyjobsonline.blogspot.com and look for the article titled Caregiver Jobs Abroad. 
 For more agencies offering nanny and caregiver jobs, I suggest that you also visit the website Nanny Jobs Online at jobsnanny.com and Caregiver, Nanny, and Housekeeping Jobs Worldwide at nannyjobsonline.blogspot.com 
 For nursing jobs abroad, I suggest that you visit the website Nursing Jobs Abroad for Filipinos at nursingjobs.ph and Nursing Jobs Abroad at nursingjobsabroadforfilipinos.blogspot.com 
 For POEA approved jobs, I suggest that you visit the website approvedpoeajobs.blogspot.com 
 Thanks for visiting my website Caregiver Work Abroad.

 In June 2005, I entered Saint Louis University and there I took a degree in Bachelor of Science in Nursing and graduated in March 2009, at the age of 19. I passed the examination for nurses on June of the same year . 
 During the four years, I ranked above average of my class. I enjoyed my duties and responsibilities as a student nurse with the different areas in the hospital, and I believe that I have developed the ability to handle the more challenging and responsible work that would be required in your institution. 
 This is my first attempt to apply as a nurse and to practice my profession, and it is a privilege for me if ever I will be given the chance to work with you.
