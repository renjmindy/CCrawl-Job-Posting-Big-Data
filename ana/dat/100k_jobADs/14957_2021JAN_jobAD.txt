 At Micro Services Inc we believe that writing, deploying, and running code has become too complex. We want to strip away all the excess and get developers focused back on the code and not the plumbing. Weâ€™re building M3O (pronounced "em-three-oh"); a cloud platform for microservices development (https://m3o.com/). A fully managed service which lets developers focus on writing code rather than managing the infrastructure. Micro is a powerful developer first focused platform for API and Go based microservices development. Move beyond Rails and Spring to the new cloud native development model.
