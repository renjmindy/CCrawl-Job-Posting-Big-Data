 Another Job 
 Here's something to consider if you or your bookish friends might be looking for part-time work: 
 Permanent part-time positions are available at DC's Politics and Prose bookstore to staff our out-of-store (offsite) author events and book parties. Candidates should be responsible, resourceful, personable, professional, and must have strong communication skills. A valid driver's license, flexible working hours (must be available days and evenings), and the ability to carry heavy boxes (of books) are all required. If you are interested, please email  bkogod@politics-prose.com .
