 Craft CMS / PHP developer position LOCALPERMANENT 
 Job Description 
 Mud are a leading digital agency in the South West, based in beautiful Bath. We're offering a salary of up to £40k for an enthusiastic web developer with good knowledge of Craft CMS to join our team. 
 You’ll be proficient in PHP, you'll know your way around a web server; building a solution that performs well for both our client and our client's users. We’ll give you an easy going, fun place to work, and a variety of interesting projects to work on. 
 The role 
 You’ll be building websites from the ground up, predominantly on the Craft CMS platform. You will be involved throughout the project, from the planning stage through to testing/QA, deployment, delivery and post-launch support. You will typically be working on 2-3 projects at a time integrating high quality frontend code into content management systems and dynamic web apps. 
 You'll also be working with the team in supporting our catalogue of existing sites and providing ongoing support to our project managers and clients. 
 You will be enthusiastic about web development and excited about new tools, techniques and technologies but know when this distracts from Getting Things Done. You must be self-motivated, organised and focused in your work but happy collaborating with others. 
 What you'll get 
 
 A salary of between £30k - £40k, depending on experience 
 A range of exciting projects to work on, for a mix of clients big and small

 Pension Scheme with employer contributions 
 Flexible working and remote working opportunities (now, obviously, but ongoing as well) 
 Constant opportunities to learn - we support our team to develop as much as we can 
 A £500 'curiosity and inspiration' training budget 
 A supportive and friendly working environment 
 Regular socials
