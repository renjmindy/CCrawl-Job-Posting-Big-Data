 By NY Workers Compensation Attorneys 
 **On the Job Injury Lawyer - Queens, NY ** 
 Nearly all states have very strict laws about the illegality of an employer retaliating against an employee who has filed for workers’ compensation benefits. If you believe you are being retaliated against after being injured while at work, it is important to seek the guidance of an experienced Queens, New York on the job injury lawyer. The legal team at  Polsky, Shouldice & Rosen, P.C.  has extensive experience dealing with all manner of workers’ compensation and job injury matters, so please do not hesitate to reach out to us today. 
 Workers' compensation laws do vary by state; however, these laws generally require most employers to carry insurance coverage for employees who fall ill or are injured while working. There are special exemptions, and these typically apply to employers who have fewer than a certain number of employees, own an agricultural company, or are federally registered. If an employer is exempt from carrying workers' compensation insurance, you may not be able to receive these specific benefits. In the event this is true for you, it may be possible that you can recover your lost expenses through other means; such as, a personal injury claim. Please consider scheduling a consultation with a Queens, NY on the job injury lawyer today in order to explore your legal options fully. 
 Understanding Workers ' Compensation Insurance 
 The amount of money an employer will have to pay for workers' compensation is dependent on the number of claims that have been filed in the past. In general, the more injuries and illnesses that have occurred, the higher their insurance premium will be. For this reason, it is certainly possible that an employer would try to avoid having certain injuries reported in an effort to minimize financial liability. In this case, the employer might ask the employee not to file a workers' compensation claim. Alternatively, an employer may try to retaliate in the event that a worker files a claim. As such retaliation is illegal, it is important to connect with a Queens, NY on the job injury lawyer if this is happening to you. 
 Compensation for an Employee Who Was Discriminated Against After Filing for Workers ' Compensation 
 If you had the right to file for workers' compensation, and you can prove that you were retaliated against after you filed for the benefits, a separate lawsuit may be filed against your employer. A  Queens, NY on the job injury lawyer  can help. If you win your case, you may recover damages for: 
 
 Past wages 
 Future wages 
 Emotional anguish 
 Legal fees 
 + More 
 
 Retaliation for workers' compensation lawsuits tend to be very expensive for the employer because most states do not have any caps on these claims. This means an employer will likely want to settle out of court, and as fast as possible.
