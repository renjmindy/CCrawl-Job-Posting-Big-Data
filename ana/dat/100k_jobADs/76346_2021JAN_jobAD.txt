  Facebook Career Fairy: Long-Term Unemployed Wish  
 Work It Daily 
 September 12, 2012 
 When you've been  unemployed  for a long time, it can be difficult to keep up your motivation. We received the following career wish from one of our Facebook fans: 
 
 My career wish is to locate a full time, good paying job. I've been searching for almost 5 years with not too much luck. I did land a temporary, part time job, but that has been reduced to work as needed hours only. So, the search continues. I have a great background in Human Resources and can learn and adapt to just about anything. So, career fairy, can you land me a job? - Susan 
 
 Congratulations, Susan! The Facebook Career Fairy chose your wish and answered it with a personalized video! Not only that, but you will also receive one FREE month inside  CareerHMO , the virtual membership site that gives the everyday professional access to elite-level career coaching! Check out the Career Fairy's personalized response below, and post your own career wishes on our Facebook page!
