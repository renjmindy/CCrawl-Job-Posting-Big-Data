  4 Steps To A Successful Career As A Certified Credit Counselor  
 Charlie Brown 
 January 10, 2014 
 To be a good credit counselor, you need to be certified. Besides, a certification also ensures your clients’ confidence in you and your services. In a nutshell, a credit counselor is responsible for analyzing the financial status of a client by looking carefully into the debts owed and the income that is earned. Based on this, they devise a plan for a debt-free life. While debt settlement lawyers bring their clients out of the financial mess, a credit counselor ensures that his clients do not fall into this mess in the very first place. Credit counselors help their clients stick to a budget and guide them to manage their expenses effectively. Here are the steps that will ensure you a successful career as a certified credit counselor: 
 
 1. Get Formal Education 
 If you wish to be a certified credit counselor, you ought to have a formal degree in finance or accounting (or both) since these are the two major aspects that a credit counselor has to look into. To put it simply, a credit counselor will never be worth his salt if he does not have a formal education in either of these areas since the basic job is to guide their clients financially. A financial or accounting degree will have you familiarized with the various financial terms, situations, and solutions that will help solve your clients’ issues. 
 2. Complement Your Financial Education With Counselor Training 
 Having a financial degree will help solve your clients’ debt related problems, but that can be taken care of by debt settlement lawyers as well. You may not realize it but a person suffering from a severe financial crisis is usually also an emotional wreck. Providing some emotional support and counseling is also a must. Therefore, to make your financial advice more effective, you will also need to explore the emotional side by training as a counselor. 
 3. Get Certified 
 Simply possessing financial knowledge and counseling capabilities does not make you a good credit counselor. For people to trust you blindly, you need to give them a reason that you are one of the best in the business. Therefore, a certification by an accredited institution is an excellent way to amalgamate your financial and counseling skills. This will not only help clients build a trust in you but will also encourage your employers to welcome you into their company. 
 4. Opt For Advanced Certification 
 Financial problems are a broad spectrum. Instead, you could select a specific financial problem like debt settlement or mortgage debts and then work in that direction to provide in depth guidance pertaining to just one specific financial issue.
