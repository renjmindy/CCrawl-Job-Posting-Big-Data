 Justice Involved and Ex-Offender Resources 
 This page provides helpful resources to assist job seekers who have previously been convicted of a crime. For many recently released individuals, transitioning back to everyday life can be a challenge - many people don't know where to start. 
 The first step is take care of basic issues such as Housing. In NY State, you can log onto  MyBenefits  for information on programs you may qualify for such as food stamps, healthcare, and housing assistance. 
 Licensing and Convictions 
 Read the latest  Licensing Guide  to see how convictions may impact obtaining and maintaining NYS Licenses and Certifications in various professions. (ex. Barber, School bus driver, Lawyer) 
 Do you have a criminal conviction and have you remained crime-free for 10 years? 
 You may be able to have up to two criminal convictions and related charges sealed under new  Criminal Procedure Law ยง160.59 
 Certificates of Rehabilitation 
 
 http://www.doccs.ny.gov/certrelief.html 
 http://lac.org/toolkits/certificates/certificates.htm 
 
 If you have a conviction for a felony or misdemeanor, or if you have a JO (Juvenile Offender) adjudication, you can apply for a certificate of rehabilitation. These certificates may help when you are looking for a job or applying for an occupational license. (You do NOT need a certificate if you have a JD (Juvenile Delinquent) or YO (Youthful Offender) adjudication because they are NOT convictions. 
 Rap Sheets 
 It's a good idea to see a copy of your rap (Record of Arrest and Prosecution) sheet prior to looking for work, so you can correct any errors on it. 
 A good resource to get you started is this booklet about rap sheets

 Hiring Incentives for Employers 
 There are several hiring incentives available in NYS to help eliminate barriers and encourage companies to hire you. 
 
 
 Federal Bonding Program  : This is an insurance policy for businesses that protects against any loss of money or property due to employee dishonesty. You can only apply for the program once you have a job offer with a start date. Once you have a start date, either you or your new employer can contact the local bonding coordinator to get the bonding process started. 
 
 Fact Sheet . 
 In Niagara County, the contact is  Vicki Allen  or (716) 433-6766 
 For more information, go to  http://www.labor.ny.gov/businessservices/services/fbp.s 
 
 
 
 Work Opportunity  Tax Credit : The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) is a tax credit for companies who hire individuals from one of several target groups, which includes ex-offenders. Businesses can receive a tax credit up to $2,400 if they hire an ex-felon within 1 year of either that individual's conviction  or  release from prison, whichever is later. 
 
 Fact Sheet 
 More information and the steps to apply for this Tax Credit can be found at  http://www.labor.ny.gov/businessservices/edsu/edsu%20wotc.shtm

 Applications 
 A Job Application is a legal document so NEVER falsify the information you give on an application. A business has the right to ask if you were ever CONVICTED of a felony or misdemeanor, they  cannot  ask if you have ever been ARRESTED. Many employment experts suggest when an application asks about a conviction, answer "Yes" and then add "Willing to discuss in more detail at the interview". 
 A helpful Guide for "How to answer Application and Interview questions regarding your conviction" can be found on the  Legal Action Center's website. 
 Job Search sites specifically targeted to ex-offenders 
 
 H.I.R.E.    -  Established by the Legal Action Center in 2001, the National  H  elping  I  ndividuals with criminal records  R  e-enter through  E  mployment (H.I.R.E.) Network is both a national clearinghouse for information and an advocate for policy change. It is one of several special projects at the Legal Action Center. The goal of the National H.I.R.E. Network is to increase the number and quality of job opportunities available to people with criminal records.
