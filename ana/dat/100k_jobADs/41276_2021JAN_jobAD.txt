 What is an ESL teacher? 
 ESL (English as a Second Language) teachers give English language lessons to non-native speakers. They usually work in schools and other educational settings, teaching children and/or adults. 
 What does an ESL teacher do? 
 ESL teachers prepare course materials and design lessons that cover all aspects of the English language, whether written or verbal. They keep track of student progress and customize individualized plans for students with special requirements. They’re also responsible for creating a positive class environment and encouraging students to reach their learning goals. 
 ESL teacher job duties include: 
 
 Organizing coursework and learning materials 
 Assessing student progress and writing reports 
 Following national and regional policies for teaching English as a second language 
 
 When crafting your own ESL teacher job description make sure to tailor these responsibilities to your specific needs. 
 What is required to be an ESL teacher? 
 Most ESL teachers have a degree in English and an ESL or TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) certification. ESL teacher requirements include basic software skills, usually MS Office, to complete administrative tasks, such as updating student records. To be successful in this role, it’s important to have a patient and resilient personality and great communication skills.
