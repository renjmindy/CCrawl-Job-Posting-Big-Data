  3 Things You Should Know Before Contacting A Recruiter  
 Laura Smith-Proulx 
 Jenna Arcand 
 January 14, 2021 
   
 Considering contacting a recruiter to find out about jobs in your field, or had a recruiter reach out to you on LinkedIn? Many job seekers assume forging connections with recruiters will put them closer to lucrative, high-level positions that aren't otherwise advertised. However, a successful recruiter-job seeker relationship doesn't just happen. 
 It's important to understand the relationship among all involved parties (the recruiter, company, and you), get your resume in top shape, and to be ready to deal with potential objections. These tips will help you prepare to work effectively with a recruiter—with better results from the relationship and a faster outcome for your job search: 
 1. Recruiters Often Source Candidates Who've Been There, Done That 
 Career professionals and executives who have followed a straight-line, traditional career trajectory (and very few job changes) are the best candidates for working with a recruiter. The reason? Recruiters are hired by companies to identify talent among leaders who can demonstrate commitment to a specific type of career or skill set, with steady advancement toward a senior-level role in their particular field.  If you've been  job-hopping , recruiters may not reach out to you for this reason. But you can contact them if you're able to explain your career moves and experience, and market yourself as a great job candidate. With a  well-optimized LinkedIn profile , recruiters will likely contact you if you have expertise and demonstrated success in the areas their clients are looking to hire.  
 2. A Recruiter's Mission Is To Focus On Their Client's Needs 
 What many job seekers fail to grasp is that recruiter job orders often contain specific details on the background, education, career history, and competencies of the ideal candidate. Depending upon the recruiter's relationship with their clients, they may not be able to convince the company to take a chance on your background—especially if it's not in line with these requirements. A recruiter must not only be comfortable with the strength of your credentials, but confident that you represent a true personality and  cultural fit  within their client companies. After all, the recruiter's professional reputation (and future commissions) are riding on their ability to supply the all-around perfect candidate. 
 3. Your Resume Must Be Ready To Present To Their Clients 
 Too often, job seekers send a resume to recruiters that undercuts their abilities—making it difficult for the recruiter to promote the job seeker as a viable candidate. If your resume hasn't been reviewed by colleagues, it's in your best interest to request a critique or ask for suggestions. Some recruiters even refer their clients to  career coaches  who can elicit a strong  personal branding message  on the resume. Others can often see qualities in your background that you're too close to realize, and their recommendations can make the difference in the response you receive from a recruiter. 
 As a job hunting method, working with recruiters can be very effective, but only if you go in with an awareness of your role, fitness as a candidate, and realistic expectations.

  How To Prepare Yourself For Offbeat Interview Questions  
 Don Goodman 
 Aaron Sanborn 
 January 14, 2021 
   
 Doing well in an interview is the result of many things, ranging from the first impressions you make with your physical appearance (body language) to how well you communicate and respond to the interview questions. 
 There are the predictable questions, such as “What are your greatest strengths/weaknesses?" and then there are the unusual questions that may make your nerves rattle and leave you dazed as to how to respond diplomatically and professionally.  The fact is, there isn't going to be a correct  answer  to unusual questions, only a correct  response . Such questions are usually asked to help the employer understand how well you handle tough situations and how you think through solutions. Are you one to get rattled and break down in communication when stumped with an odd question? Or do you stay calm, cool, and collected, maintaining confidence and a positive attitude?   There's no real way to prepare for the unusual questions because they are “offbeat," but what you can do is ensure your communication and responses to such questions leave a positive message that helps the employer develop the best possible impression of you. Here are a few tips to help you maintain positive communication and composure during job interviews regardless of what questions are asked: 
 Stay Positive In Your Approach 
 Your mission is to make yourself desirable to the employer based on your experience, talent, and skills. If you focus on what you have to offer and express confidence and a positive tone, the employer will develop a much better impression in your favor than if you touch on negative points that may make you less favorable of a candidate.  Even when questions are asked about  your weaknesses , your mission is to address the question directly and immediately turn it to a more positive note such as how you would work through the problem and address it. 
 Don't Restate The Negative 
 Just because an employer positions a question a specific way that may connote the negative, do not follow that lead in your response. For instance, avoid stating, "My greatest weakness is..." Instead, respond by jumping right into what you have done to address the issue and how it has helped you succeed. This approach helps you avoid jumping around the question and puts the focus of the key message on an area that is an advantage for you. To prepare yourself for this type of question and other behavioral interview questions, consider doing a  mock interview  with a friend or professional acquaintance.  
 Turn To Your Creative Side And Humor 
 Not all questions in an interview require a serious response. Unusual questions are often times asked by employers to test your creativity and humor. Demonstrate your ability to think on your feet. Also, find ways in which you can relate it back to the job. The important thing is to not let these types of interview questions stump you, and the best way to do that is to take in the question with a bit of humor and respond in the same manner. It's also important to make sure that the question doesn't cross the line! Be on the lookout for these  illegal interview questions . 
 Never Say, "I Don't Know." 
 via GIPHY Such a response implies to an employer that you are unprepared and give up easily to challenges, which isn't the ideal impression you want to make. Take a moment to process the question and analyze how you can respond in a way to further express your character while possibly tying it back to your capabilities for the job. In such situations, it may also help to think out loud. Such an approach helps you walk the employer through your thought process rather than have dead silence in the air for too long.  The key to doing well in a job interview as it relates to communication and your response to questions is to remain poised and self-assured. While the question may appear to be an approach by the employer to knock you off of your feet, remain positive and calm in your response. Also, always give a response that ties back to how you are the most fit for the job. Looking for more advice? Work It Daily can help!

  6 Reasons Why Your Resume Isn't Getting A Response  
 Jessica Holbrook Hernandez 
 Jenna Arcand 
 January 13, 2021 
   
 It can be hard to ascertain if it's your resume, the job market, or who knows what else when you're job hunting and your phone just isn't ringing. Your mind begins to wander as you anxiously await an employer's call or email. 
 Many job seekers have called us and said, “I think it's my resume, but I'm not sure." After reviewing their documents, we find ourselves telling them, "Yes, it's your resume," 99% of the time. So, how do you know if it's really your resume or if it's something else? Take a look at these six mistakes job seekers make on their resumes, and if one or more of them can be found on yours, that's probably why your resume isn't getting a response. 
 1. It Still Has An Objective Statement 
 An objective statement is a section of a resume that expresses your goal of securing a future position. What this statement fails to do, though, is substantiate your fit for the job opening—or articulate the value you offer the employer should they choose you over another candidate. Ditch the objective statement and utilize a  personal branding statement  and experience summary instead. An experience summary is a list of skills you have that are needed for the job you're applying for. They're hard skills and transferable skills, not soft skills. By having an objective statement on your resume, you're missing out on the opportunity to start proving your value to the employer within the first few seconds they glance at your resume, which is exactly the purpose of a personal branding statement and experience summary. 
 2. It Lacks Any Form Of Personal Branding 
 When employers read a resume, they need to see what attributes you bring to the position. It helps them differentiate between you and other viable candidates. Are you deadline-driven and customer-focused? These are important to employers and how they operate business. What is it that's important to the employer from whom you're seeking to obtain employment? And how do your expertise and experience correlate to their greatest need? Personal branding  is about how you market yourself to the potential employer. They have a need to fill, and you have to figure out how who you are and what you offer meet that need—then effectively communicate that to the employer. If you can't meet a need, then they won't see the value in choosing you over another candidate who does. 
 3. It's Fluffy 
 Your career summary and work history is  full of fluff  and filler words that could apply to every job seeker on the market. Here's an example of what we mean: Dynamic, results-focused IT specialist with broad-based expertise in project oversight, systems implementation, process improvements, and integrating cutting-edge technology that exceeds expectations. Proven ability to quickly analyze key business drivers and work directly with internal/external staff, leveraging a team-centered effort that increases profitability. Sure, it might sound good, but it hasn't told us anything specific about who this candidate is, their experience/expertise, and what they offer the employer. It would be better to address how many projects the candidate has overseen, which processes they improved, the outcome of the improvement, and how the cutting-edge technology they integrated exceeded expectations. But just saying they exceed expectations is vague; tell us which expectations were exceeded and by how much. 
 4. Skills & Accomplishments Are Not Highlighted 
 The top third of your resume is the most important section when the hiring manager is giving it his or her initial scan. This is your prime opportunity to market your skills and achievements. Remember the experience summary we mentioned above? That's where you'll write the  skills you possess  that are needed to succeed in this particular job.  Highlighting your skills in the experience summary will draw the hiring manager in, and entice them to keep reading. Then, as their eyes move down your resume, they'll see all of your accomplishments underneath your work history. What career successes are you most proud of that correlate to the job you're applying for?  
 5. Duties And Responsibilities Have Taken Over 
 Bullet points that only share basic duties and responsibilities fall short every time. Maximize the space on  your resume  by using the STAR method (situation, task, action, result). Talk about challenges you faced, how you addressed them, and what the outcomes were. This makes the information contained within your resume much more impactful. 
 6. Metrics, Facts, And Figures Are Nowhere To Be Found 
 Give the employer something to remember you by. Don't just tell them you reduced costs. State a percentage or dollar amount. Manage projects or clients? Put a number to it. Ask yourself questions like how much, how many, for how long? This is how you  quantify your work experience on your resume . It's the secret to getting a call from an employer.  Asking yourself questions like these leads to answers that help you define your successes, develop your personal brand, and market yourself more effectively to potential employers. 
 Review your resume with the six points above in mind. Ask yourself if your resume reflects any of the above. If it does, then use the tips and advice we've provided to correct the issues within your resume—and ultimately improve its response rate.  Need more resume help? We're here for you!

  How To Update Your LinkedIn Profile When You’re Employed  
 Don Goodman 
 Aaron Sanborn 
 January 11, 2021 
   
 A key component of a successful job search means getting the word out that you're looking for new opportunities. But when you're still employed, it's wise to take a more discreet approach. 
 This is particularly true for LinkedIn, where there are many contacts and connections happening on a daily basis and any small peep out of your account about a job search will likely get spread to your co-workers and your boss. 
 That is something to avoid if you don't want to compromise your current job. You can be discreet and take precautions with the activities you conduct on LinkedIn by doing the following: 
 Change Your Privacy Settings 
 You don't need to broadcast to your network of contacts the new connections you make with recruiters and the job search groups you've joined. Place your mouse on your picture in the top right and choose  Settings & Privacy.  Under  Privacy Controls  select  Turn on/off your activity broadcasts  and uncheck the box for "Let people know when you change your profile, make recommendations, or follow companies." Also click on "Select who can see your activity feed" and make it only you. There are a lot of  subtle ways  to signal to your network that you're looking for work without advertising it on your LinkedIn profile. 
 Be Aware Of The Message Your Profile Is Sending 
 Social media  allows us to openly speak what we're thinking and feeling, but that doesn't mean advertising to everyone that you're looking for a new job or suddenly making an update that you're willing to relocate in your status or summary. Even if you think it's only going to your inner circle of friends, word can easily spread on social networking sites. Things like "willing to relocate" are a dead giveaway. These are details that should be left off your LinkedIn profile and saved for more personal conversations and job interviews. 
 Don't Show The Job Search Groups You've Joined 
 When you start joining different  job search groups , it is heavily hinting at your job search activity. You can continue to take advantage of using such groups, but change the settings so that the group's logo does not get displayed on your profile. Go to the group and click the  More  tab followed by  Your Settings  in the dropdown menu. From there you can click the  Visibility Settings  to uncheck "Display the group logo on your profile." 
 How To Utilize LinkedIn During The Job Search 
  Now that you know what NOT to do, here's what you can do to utilize LinkedIn for your job hunt. Make your profile visible to employers and recruiters.  Your profile needs to be made public in order for employers and recruiters to see your information. Under  Privacy Controls , you can check which content on your profile is made public. Don't be anonymous.  When you begin to view recruiter profiles and employer contact profiles, adjust your settings so that you don't come off as "Anonymous viewed your profile." By offering your full information, it prompts the other end to take a look at your profile. Accept messages.  While setting up your account, indicate that you're interested in career opportunities and that you will accept messages from other members. Disabling these features means employers and recruiters will have a harder time finding and contacting you. Write a profile to appeal to your current and potential employers.  Your  LinkedIn profile  doesn't have to say, "I'm looking for a job" in order for employers to take notice of you. By simply stating your key skill sets, the value you bring, and what you have to offer, employers will see the appeal and want to contact you.  Just as the general advice goes to not quit your job before you secure a new job, you want to take every precaution possible when using LinkedIn to not impact your current job.

  5 Things To Ask In A Job Interview  
 ZipRecruiter 
 Aaron Sanborn 
 January 08, 2021 
   
 “Do you have any questions for me?" This is typically the final question you will be asked in a job interview. 
 Ask the wrong questions and you might look like a bad fit. Ask no questions and you might look indifferent, inexperienced, or uneducated about the position. 
 Asking the right questions—aside from proving yourself to the hiring manager—is one of your best (and last) chances to determine whether the job and company are a good fit for you. Here are five questions to consider: 
 Why Is The Position Open? 
 This is actually an extremely important question that should be asked during every job interview because the answer will provide important insights that, should you get an offer, will play a major role in your  decision to take the job . Jobs open up for a variety of reasons—some positive, some negative. Was the job created because the company is expanding? Was the previous person promoted? Or did they quit or get fired? Are you replacing a high performer, or a poor one? The employer's answer will help you determine whether the job has room for growth or a high turnover rate, and give you a better idea of how to manage expectations. 
 What Is A Typical Day Like For This Position? 
 Most job postings list the position's responsibilities without saying how much time is allocated to each responsibility. You want to know this information for two reasons.  First, if your typical workday includes spending hours doing something you dislike, you may want to reconsider whether it's the right job for you. Second, by discovering which job functions are most important to the employer, you can tailor the remainder of your interview to those areas and include them in your  interview follow up . 
 How Would You Describe The Company Culture? 
 It's always good to get a sense of a company's culture and whether you fit into it. The employer's response to this question will help you understand what it's like working there day-to-day, what the company values are, how colleagues interact with one another, and so on.  Another good way to get a sense of company culture is to ask these questions: Can you tell me about one of your most successful employees and what makes them successful? If the answer includes an employee who takes on a lot of extra work and works way more than 40 hours a week, this could be a red flag where the company's values are only grounded in work. Ultimately, you want an answer where the response includes a combination of hard work, creativity, and character.  If you're going to spend the majority of your waking hours on the job, you should make sure the company culture is a  good fit . 
 What Are The Company's Goals Over The Next Five Years? 
 Actually, a more specific question you could ask is:  What are the goals of the company over the next five years? How does this position and this department factor into those goals? This question demonstrates your  goal-oriented nature  and suggests that you won't job hop right away. An informed response will give you insight into the organizational structure and how your position fits into it. An uninformed response suggests the hiring manager is out of touch with the organization, the organization does a poor job communicating its goals to employees, or the organization is not thinking long term. None of these are a good sign. Here's another way to ask this question: What is the company's biggest challenge in the coming years, and how does this position help you overcome it? 
 Do You Like Working Here? 
 It's unlikely the hiring manager will say "no" but you can still infer a lot from their response. A moment's hesitation followed only by, "Yeah...I do," might be a red flag. A smile and explanation of  why they like working there, on the other hand, signifies a more genuine response.  A few other ways to ask this question include: How did you come to work here? What do you like most about working here? If you interview with multiple employees during your job interview, ask them each similar questions. This is particularly helpful when it comes to the subjective questions (e.g. "How would you describe the company culture?" and "Do you like working here?"). Doing so will help you paint a more complete picture of the organization, which will help you make the best decision once you're offered the job. Looking for more advice? Work It Daily can help!

  How To Effectively Demonstrate Your Value In A Job Interview  
 Margaret Buj 
 Aaron Sanborn 
 January 06, 2021 
   
 One of the most common reasons candidates get rejected after a job interview is that they don't provide enough relevant, tangible examples of what they've done in their current/previous job that would be relevant to the position they are seeking. 
 When you're looking for a new job, you need to provide specific concrete examples of the competencies listed on a job description—whether it is problem-solving, influencing, taking initiative, or managing change.  A lot of job seekers will give generic examples or just talk about what they've done—but without mentioning specific accomplishments. You could be very good at your current job, but if you struggle to demonstrate your expertise effectively in a job interview, you may miss out on your next career opportunity. Here are a few tips to help you overcome any blocks you might have about talking about your achievements: 
 Discussing Accomplishments Isn't Bragging 
 One of the reasons candidates shy away from talking about their accomplishments is because they don't want to sound arrogant. However, the job interview isn't the time to be too humble. Talking about your accomplishments and using facts and numbers isn't bragging—it's  telling a story . You have to remember that a potential employer wants you to do well in an interview. They are literally looking for an excuse to give out the job! So, tell them what they need in a clear, factual manner. 
 Demonstrate How You Overcome Challenges 
 A great way to answer questions while highlighting your skills and accomplishments is by using the Experience + Learn = Grow model and the STAR technique (situation, task, action, result). What was the situation/problem? How did you solve this problem/overcome this setback? What did you learn from this experience? How did you apply what you learned to your career? These methods are particularly beneficial when you're answering  behavioral interview questions  that hiring managers ask to see if a candidate has enough self-awareness to know what they're good at, and what skillsets need improvement. 
 Use Numbers To Your Advantage 
 Numbers are great for demonstrating your skills and expertise. Did you increase revenue, or save time/money? Did you improve a procedure and, if so, how much time did you save? How many clients did you win in your last job? Don't just tell the employer what the result was. Tell them how you got the result and what your decision-making process was.  Prepare several examples of  quantifiable results  for your next job interview and you'll significantly increase your chances of getting that job offer!  Looking for more advice?

  Is A Career In Finance Right For You?  
 Eustace Brown 
 Jenna Arcand 
 January 05, 2021 
   
 Some people just know that they want to work with money. If you've always had a head for numbers, love a good Excel formula, and have a strong sense of business, then a job in finance might be ideal for you. 
 Okay, it's not the most glamorous of jobs, but entry-level salaries are pretty good. Plus, let's face it, people will always have money and they will need someone to look after it, so a career in this field will be pretty safe, too. To most people, a job in finance is a job in finance. However, like most careers, it is one of many different fields. Do you want to be a banker or an investment manager? A financial trader or a stock broker? A chartered accountant or a tax inspector? Whatever direction you decide to take in the financial services industry will depend on your personality, your grades and qualifications, and where you are able to get your foot in a door. If you have strong analytical and communication skills, work well in a team, are a fast learner, and excel under pressure, then a career in finance might be for you. Here is the lowdown on a few financial positions: 
 Investment Management 
 Investment management is the professional asset management of a number of different financial disciplines such as shares, bonds, and other securities. It commonly refers to the buying and selling of investments to achieve a specific investment objective. Basically, these companies raise capital on behalf of their clients. This could be by trading stocks, helping to facilitate deals, or buying bonds. The starting wage for a job as an investment manager is high, but that comes with huge responsibilities and long hours. Expect to work more than 40 hours a week if you want to be a successful investment manager.  
 Chartered Accountant 
 A chartered accountant is a financial expert. Their job is to provide honest information about financial records, including financial reporting, taxation, auditing, business recovery and insolvency, and general accounting systems and processes. As a chartered accountant, you would mainly be in charge of managing a company's financial systems and budgets, regularly auditing the business' finances, and providing financial intelligence and guidance. 
 Banking 
 A job in a bank can be extremely varied, depending on where you start. Whether you begin your career as a cashier and work your way up to branch manager, or work one of the numerous departments within the bank, working in a branch demands excellent people skills and for you to be organized and good with numbers. Remember, it doesn't just end at cashiers. Working as a mortgage advisor might be more up your alley. Or, you may find your calling in retirement planning or money laundering. There are so many possibilities to consider when looking into a financial career at a bank.  
 Finance Controller 
 A job as a credit or finance controller is ideal for a candidate who is highly organized, forward-thinking, and good with money. As a finance controller, your main role would be to manage and oversee the accounts department, ensuring everything runs efficiently. Finance controllers often manage a team of accountants; day to day tasks include analysis of books, producing accounts, auditing, and reporting to management. 
 Tax Specialist 
 For as long as tax exists, people will need tax advice. The role of a tax specialist is to provide individuals, small businesses, and large companies well-informed, clear, and simple tax advice. Most specialists choose to focus on advising their clients on ways to reduce their tax bills (tax planning) or helping to prepare and submit tax return forms (tax compliance). Tax specialists need to be adept in staying up to date on tax law and liaising. 
 Whether you're looking to start your career in finance after college, or want to make a career change to the industry, these five positions could be perfect for you. We hope this information helps you make the right decision.  Need more help figuring out your career path? We're here for you! Check out our  FREE resources  page and  Live Events Calendar .

  4 Mistakes That Will Derail Your Job Search  
 Don Goodman 
 Aaron Sanborn 
 January 05, 2021 
   
 For some people, it may just take a month or two to go from job hunting to landing that dream job offer and starting work. 
 However, it's not always that easy and smooth of a process. 
 As a job seeker, you may not have much control over the employer's interviewing and hiring process, but you do have control over how you approach the job search process. Avoid the chance of extending your job search or unemployment by being proactive with your job search efforts. Here are four things that will derail your job search, and why you should avoid them at all costs.  
 Procrastinating 
 For some who can afford to take time off from work, that's great—but don't extend the time off to the point of laziness.  The bigger the gap between employments, the more negative it reflects on you. It also doesn't help you make the case that you're a professional who's driven and on top of the game in your profession if you've been  out of work  for an extended period of time. 
 Relying On Applying For Jobs Through Job Boards 
 There are various ways in which you can go about the job hunt. Looking at job boards for the right opportunities and applying to them is one way, but not necessarily the most effective technique.  Employers may receive hundreds of resumes through job boards and the chance of them picking out yours is slim, if your resume even makes it past the Applicant Tracking System (ATS). The best way to get your resume in front of the right person is through a referral from networking. Utilize contacts you have to help get you in front of the right people. Expand your job search to LinkedIn and Twitter. This is where you may make more  direct contact  with the individuals that matter. It's better than sending your resume to the general HR inbox. 
 Settling For The First Job Offer 
 Yes, getting a job offer is exciting, but it doesn't mean you should accept it. Really understand if it's the job you want and if it's a job that will pave the way to where you want to be in your career. If you're unhappy, you'll only wind up back at Step One—job hunting again.  The only exception to this is if you've been looking for a job and unemployed for a lengthy time and you want to use it as a platform to help boost the chance of  landing a better job . It can be easier to impress employers when they know you're employed than if you've been unemployed for a long time. 
 Telling The World You're Unemployed And Asking Them To Help You Find A Job 
 Advertising to your entire network of contacts that you're unemployed and need help finding a job isn't necessarily going to help.
