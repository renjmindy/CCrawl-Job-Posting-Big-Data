 11 Reasons You Didn’t Get the Job 
 Job hunting is probably one of the most frustrating and discouraging things you’ll ever have to do. You’ve applied for a lot of positions and even got a few interviews. If you didn’t get the job, you’ll likely never know exactly why. Keep reading to learn 11 common reasons a company didn’t extend an offer so you know where you can improve next time. 
 1. You were underqualified 
 Before you apply for a job, review the qualifications and skills required. Many small businesses are willing to teach someone a new skill if they’re right for the position, so don’t worry if you don’t meet every qualification. You should, however, try to meet most of them. 
 2. You were overqualified 
 On the other hand, if you’re overqualified, a company might pass on you, too. They probably thought that you would get bored quickly and move on. Then, they’d have to hire someone for this same position just a few months after hiring you. 
 If you’re purposely applying to jobs that you’re overqualified for because you’re burnt out and want to change career paths, make sure to explain that in your cover letter.

 3. You were rude to the receptionist 
 Whether you realize it, your interview starts the second you walk into the office. The receptionist might not be in the room during your conversation, but their opinion of you might affect the hiring decision. So, it doesn’t hurt to suck up to the receptionist a little bit. 
 4. You were late to the interview 
 Whoever meets with you might keep you waiting because they had a meeting run long or they want to see how flexible you are. But you should not make that person wait for you. Plan to arrive a few minutes early to give yourself time to find a parking space and collect your thoughts. If something out of your control happens to prevent you from arriving on time, call the company ASAP and explain what’s happening. 
 5. You didn’t show that you were excited about the job 
 You want this position and applied for it for a reason, so make sure the company knows that. If they don’t think you’re excited, they’ll probably think you’ll take anything until something better comes along. 
 6. You didn’t prepare for the interview 
 You can’t predict what you’ll be asked, but you can make sure you know how you’re going to answer things like, “What’s your biggest weakness?” You might also consider preparing a few questions of your own to show your interviewer that you’re prepared and are genuinely interested in the position.

 7. You didn’t research the company 
 Your interviewer will likely ask some version, “Why do you want to work for this company?” Your answer should show that you know a little bit about the organization, including what they do and what matters most to them. 
 8. You weren’t confident enough 
 You know what skills you have and what you can do. An interview is a great time to brag about yourself. 
 9. You were too confident 
 On the other hand, don’t be too full of yourself. You can be confident without being arrogant. 
 10. You didn’t send a thank-you note 
 After the interview, send a heartfelt thank you note or email to everyone you met with. It will keep you fresh in their minds and remind them why you’re the perfect fit for their business. 
 11. There was a more qualified candidate 
 You might have had a great interview, answered everything thoroughly, the company had you on the top of their list, but then they talked to someone else and liked them even more. Just move on and realize there’s still the right job out there for you.
