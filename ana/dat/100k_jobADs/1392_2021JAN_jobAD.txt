 Keep your job search secret with these tips. 
 Keeping Your Job Search Secret 
 
 
 Job search on your own time . Companies can view the websites you visit and emails you send during business hours and on your computer 
 
 
 Block your resume from being viewed.  Monster has a great feature called Privacy Plus that allows the candidate to block up to 20 companies from viewing their resume when a company searches for candidates. 
 
 
 Be discrete . Don't blab to everyone in the office that you're looking for a job. Keep your search to yourself. 
 
 
 Confidential Resumes on Job Boards . You can use these on job boards, however I'm not a fan. I normally contact the candidate directly from my work email and keep their resume saved. Recruiters skip over these candidates because they aren't worth the trouble. Consider using your maiden name or your middle name in your contact information. Later on in the interview process, you can let the company know you go by Patrick instead of James. 
 
 
 Ask the prospective company not to contact your current company . Although, this is supposed to be confidential, it does happen. Let the prospective company you would like to keep your interest confidential. 
 
 
 Use a headhunter or recruiter.  They will submit your resume confidentially. Depending on the position and your position level, this is an excellent option for in demand industries, high level, VP and above candidates.
