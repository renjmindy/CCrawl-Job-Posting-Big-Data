 Here at Gousto, we are on a mission to become the UK's favourite way to eat dinner! 
 Delicious recipes, precise ingredients & a dollop of adventure, delivered to your door. We have invested into our technology, data capability and our product to ensure the customer is at the heart of what we do. Every aspect of our business is powered by our passion. 
 Whether it is innovation through our recipe development, building algorithms to optimise our recipe box journey or devising strategies to reduce plastic and food waste. All our teams play a part in our amazing growth in the UK! 
 Our DREAM? To be the most-loved way to eat dinner, and for every meal to leave the planet better off. Gousto is changing how people shop, cook and eat food at home. It’s an incredibly exciting time to join our team! 
 Senior Data Engineer 
 At Gousto we know that a great product backed by great data is key to our success. Our Data Engineering team is core to that. We are looking for a Senior Data Engineer to join our growing team to support our big plans for 2021 and beyond. 
 We’re pretty proud of the data products we’ve built, but recognise that there is always more we can do to evolve our stack and add value to our data consumers. As we expand, we want to take our data stack to the next level in both features available and trust in it’s quality. All while using cool technologies and approaches to ensure what we build will scale. 
 The Senior Data Engineer role is key to our growth and scale. We’re looking for someone who has been in the trenches building data platforms and solutions and can bring a wealth of experience to the team. This role will give you exposure to data across Gousto’s tribes and will have plenty to keep you interested! 
 We have a great team of Data and Analytics Engineers to work with to help design, implement, build and support best-in-class data products. You’ll also be working with our wider Data team composed of Data Scientists and Product Analysts. You’ll also be helping to embed strong data engineering toolsets and practices throughout our Tech team. 
 What Will Keep You Busy 
 
 Building best-in-class solutions - You’ll be key in expanding our designs, and taking on technical leadership to deliver. 
 Own and improve our data infrastructure - We are also striving to keep improving it as we grow, so a big part of this role will be investigating the next-generation data processing & analytics technologies. We are 100% committed to provide self-serve capabilities in near real-time manner to all teams across the business. 
 Striving for impact and delivery - You will have a significant impact on how we leverage data to propel the business. Hence, you will partner up with other teams across the business to understand their data needs and work with them to find the best solution. 
 Obsessing over quality - As a data enthusiast you must have already heard a quote "garbage in, garbage out". To ensure high-quality of data, guaranteeing accurate dashboards and robust machine-learning algorithms, we believe that every data-point needs to be valid. As a senior engineer - you obsess over quality assurance and continually improve data validation on a daily basis.
