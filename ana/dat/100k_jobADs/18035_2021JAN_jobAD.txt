 About NextOp 
 Our Mission:“NextOp recruits, trains, and places high-performing middle-enlisted military leaders into Industry careers.” At NextOp, our vision is to be the strongest link between industry and military talent. Our Employment Coordinators engage veterans one-on-one to help tailor their resumes, build their professional network, connect with mentors, prepare for interviews, and ultimately transition the valuable skills they have developed in the military into a rewarding and fulfilling civilian career. We also work directly with employers, many of whom have a strong desire to recruit and retain veterans but have lacked the resources and knowledge of how to do so. We are currently partnering with over 100 corporations to educate them on the veteran experience, create internal veteran resource groups, host workshops and ultimately bridge the gap between veterans and full employment.
