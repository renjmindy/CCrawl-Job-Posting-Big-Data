 Bear Swimming, Tim Pitsiulak. 
 It's been a while since I've been able to do anything very creative myself. This does not mean I haven't been able to find ways to support the arts. 
 I recently got to do something cool for the place of work. It's nice to know that if you have to take a break from painting, there are many ways to still have an impact. 
 Might be able to take the brushes up again by December, will keep it posted. Until then, click the bear for a link.
