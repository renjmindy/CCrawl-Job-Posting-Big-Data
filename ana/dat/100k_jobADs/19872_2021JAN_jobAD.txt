  Looking for Job But Mom's Killing My Confidence  
 Work It Daily 
 October 06, 2009 
 Dear Experts, My mom's killing my confidence. I just graduated in May and have been looking for full-time job non-stop. The industry I want to get into is not really hiring right now. I have a part-time job, but it's not paying all the bills. I have student loans and credit card debt. So, I'm living at home. My mom is really unhappy about it. She helped pay for school and just assumed I'd be out and not her financial responsibility by now. Every day she says mean things to me about how much of a burden this is. I'm doing my best, but her comments are making me feel stupid. I want to get out on my own, but it's financially impossible. Any suggestions on how I can hurry up the process because I'm starting to lose faith that I'll ever find a job and get out of the house.  Here is how our T.A.P. experts answered this question:   Q#320  Find roommate (or 6). Get out of that toxic cesspool. Need confidence in search. Love mom from a distance. ( @dawnbugni )  Q#320  Take it easy on her. She loves U & wants U 2 have a job for YOU, too. Sit. Talk. Compromise. ( @beneubanks )  Q#320  Research 'other' industries/companies via LinkedIn/Twitter/ZoomInfo; focus ur resume message on their needs. [1/2] ( @ValueIntoWords )  Q#320  Consider 2nd part-time job to boost income (e.g., temp srvcs);share apartment costs w/roommate; be creative. [2/2] ( @ValueIntoWords )  Q#320  Moving out forced me 2 do EVERYTHING 2 find job; it happnd fast; relying on parents not healthy 4 me. ( @juliaerickson )  Q#320  Been there; so hard! Had 2 expand network, lv no stone untrnd, take temp wrk, housesit, move out ASAP. ( @juliaerickson )  Q#320  First problem to address is your Mom. Have a heart-to-heart with her and explain how she is hurting your efforts. ( @gradversity )  Q#320  Surround yourself w/mentors! Seek daily conversations w/supportive people to offset mom's negativity. ( @jtodonnell )  Q#320  It's a shame that u feel that way. Speak 2 ur mom abt. her comments. Consider getting addl p/t work to pay bills. ( @DebraWheatman )  Q#320  The 2nd p/t job will help pay bills while u continue ur search. U must have a heart 2 heart w ur mom though.
