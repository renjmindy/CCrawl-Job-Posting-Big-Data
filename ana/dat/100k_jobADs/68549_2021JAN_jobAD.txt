 Any job in the main Workable account that has the  'Published' or 'Used Internally' status  will appear in Advanced Referrals. Jobs that are 'Used Internally' are not shareable through links/social media. 
 If you are recruiting for a job that Advanced Referrals users should not know about, set the status in Workable to 'Used Confidentially'.
