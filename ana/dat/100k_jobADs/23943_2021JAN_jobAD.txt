 You live life on the road 
 You eat words for breakfast 
 Just to get by the deadline. 
 Never minding the ungodly hours 
 Nor the sore feet from walking for miles 
 Yet you get to have a love-hate relationship with power 
 You’re forever crossing a bridge to danger. 
 And then unlearning the beliefs you once had 
 And learning to cuss when bullshits stare at you with malice. 
 Oh, but the story you look for can only be beautiful 
 When the protagonist is bad and ugly with money 
 You always crumple the paper until its insanely perfect 
 After staring so long at the blank walls of your room 
 Only to realize with dismay how your work is sliced in half 
 Oh, but then you are able to see unspoken truths 
 Never heard, never written, and long forgotten. 
 How complex can your role be? 
 You are an observant in an unfolding history 
 Whose side on shall you be? 
 Ah, but you’re the gatekeeper of society 
 It’s a calling, it truly is 
 For the strong-willed can only persist 
 From finding the gold in the tunnel. 
 Knowledgeable about everything yet a master of none 
 What the hell am I talking about? 
 Ladies and gentlemen, it’s being a journalist, that’s what.
