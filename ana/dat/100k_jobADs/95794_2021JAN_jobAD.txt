  Avoiding Repetition In A Resume (When All Your Jobs Sound The Same)  
 Robin Schlinger 
 August 09, 2014 
 One of my clients came to me with a problem: she had held pretty much the same manager-level job during her entire career, only with different companies. Her resume felt boring, even to her, because every job sounded exactly alike.  Related:   7 Ways Your Resume Is Boring Just Like Everyone Elseâ€™s  I saw the problem immediately. Like many job hunters, she had focused her resume on her skills. And every job she held required almost exactly the same skill set. Anyone reading her resume would think that she had spent 10 years going nowhere. The solution?  We changed the focus of her resume to accomplishments.  In every management position, she faced different challenges and had to come up with solutions. Every position involved different goals she had to meet. Every position required her to communicate with a different group of people, work on a different team or report to a different level of supervisor. When we wrote about her accomplishments, her resume took on a whole new aspect. From yawn-worthy it went to exciting: here was a potential employee who brought value to one company after another.
