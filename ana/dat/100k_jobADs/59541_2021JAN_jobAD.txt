 Department of Biostatistics 
 The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center 
 Join the team that is once again number one in cancer care at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Biostatistics. Ranked by U.S. News and World Report’s annual “Best Hospitals” survey, the institution has held the top two positions since the start of the list. From Nobel-level collaborations to programs that dramatically accelerate the conversion of scientific discovery into clinical realities, your work will help make cancer history. 
 Exceptional candidates are sought for multiple tenured/tenure-track faculty positions at the Assistant, Associate, or full Professor level. Applicants should demonstrate prowess in interdisciplinary, collaborative scientific research. The department will consider those developing methodologies with application to biomedical research in various areas, with particular interest in early detection and cancer screening, clinical trial design, imaging, and computer-intensive methodology—including machine learning, and integrative analyses of multiplatform high-dimensional data, such as genomic, proteomic, and microbiome analysis. A Ph.D. in statistics, biostatistics, or a related field is required. 
 The department has 19 faculty members, 37 masters and doctoral-level research analysts, and 10 postdoctoral fellows. Faculty members are actively involved in collaborative and methodological research in diverse areas such as clinical trial design, cancer screening and early detection, bioinformatics, genomic pathway analysis, network analysis, and integrative modeling of multiple types of complex data. This includes high-dimensional omic data, functional data analysis, Bayesian methodology, longitudinal and survival analysis, statistical genetics, population health research, and behavioral/social statistics. 
 Our faculty collaborate with world-class cancer scientists, such as Dr. James Allison—the 2018 Nobel Prize winner for medicine—in all cancer areas and research levels. Opportunities to support large-scale studies and programs include the Moon Shots Program, which brings together the top aspects of academia and industry to swiftly translate data into patient benefits. Their large, important cancer data sets require quantitative input with impact potential. Faculty also partner with our affiliated biostatistics doctoral programs at the University of Texas, Texas A&M; University, and Rice University. Our department offers strong resources, including an in-house quantitative research computing team specializing in database design, web-based clinical trial support, scientific programming, and software engineering. For specifics, visit:  https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org . Direct further questions to the selection committee chair. 
 
 The institution offers competitive salaries and an outstanding personal and professional benefits package. Houston is one of the world’s most innovative and diverse cities, with great neighborhoods; competitive private and public schools; a dynamic music, theater and sports scene; highly acclaimed museums; international cuisine; and year-round outdoor recreational activities. 
 MD Anderson is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, religion, disability or veteran status, except where such distinction is required by law. All positions are security sensitive and subject to examination of criminal history record information. MD Anderson is a smoke-free and drug-free environment. 
 
 Consideration of applications will continue until the positions are filled. Applicants should send a cover letter outlining the relevance of their research experience and interests to the position, a curriculum vitae, a brief statement of current and proposed research, and three letters of recommendation to:
