 DANCING WITH THE WIND 
 
 These are difficult times, which we are living, in our world. They are baffling as we see human nature change, going towards a precipice from which there is no turning back. 
 In our own micro-cosmos we see the inexorable journey to the edge. 
 Extrapolate that to our immediate community, our county, our state, our country and the world, our planet. 
 We need to remember that this is the only place where the human race can live. 
 There is no "planet B". 
 In addition to that, we see many established "institutions" also changing and not for the better. 
 The mesh that holds up together is almost totally torn. 
 We are confused and don't know how to tackle this, where to start. 
 We feel alone …. yet, through the expression of these feelings and through the connection that we have through technology, we see that many feel the same.

 Remembering these lyrics: 
 _People movin ' out _ 
 People movin ' in 
 Why, because of the color of their skin 
 Run, run, run, but you sho ' can't hide 
 An eye for an eye 
 A tooth for a tooth 
_Vote for me, and I 'll set you free _ 
 Air pollution, revolution, gun control, 
 Sound of soul 
 Shootin ' rockets to the moon 
 Kids growin ' up too soon 
 Politicians say more taxes will 
 Solve everything 
_And the band played on …. _ 
 Fear in the air, tension everywhere 
 Unemployment rising fast, 
 The Beatles ' new record's a gas 
 And the only safe place to live is 
 On an Indian reservation …. 
 And the band played on 
 Eve of destruction, tax deduction 
 City inspectors, bill collectors 
 Mod clothes in demand, 
 Population out of hand 
_Suicide, too many bills, hippies movin ' _ 
 To the hills 
 People all over the world, are shoutin ' 
 End the war 
 And the band played on.

 This was the general feeling in 1970 …. where did take the fork in the road which brought us here? 
 
 _ At the end of the day  , we need a "time out". As we feel the pressure of our reality, we need to recharge. We need the energy to go at it again tomorrow and many tomorrows to come. In the meantime, we need soothing inner peace. _ 
 _I don 't mean to say forget, hide and remain inactive. I don't propose to ignore what lies ahead of all of us. I mean that we can't give what we don't have. To be able to tackle what awaits us, we need to gather ourselves, to gain momentum and fuel our spirits for this daunting task. There's a lot to unravel, a lot to undo, a lot to rebuild. _ 
 I do not believe that we can continue along this pathway much longer. 
 We need to retreat, recharge and act. We need soothing for our weary, confused and tired souls.

 I'm originally from Puerto Rico. I was born in Santurce and raised in Rio Piedras. I currently live in Florida - since 1999. I have a doctorate degree in Medicine; completed in 1976. My Internal Medicine specialty was completed in 1979. Worked for Puerto Rico's health system until 1985. At this time, I'm happily retired after working for the federal government for almost 28yrs. I also worked for the government of Puerto Rico from 1979 through 1985 .... for a total of almost 40 years as a physician. I want to offer any knowledge that I have to anyone "out there" who is interested. My views are liberal in almost every sense. My knowledge is "eclectic" - a bit of everything. Music and reading are my passion. Blogging has also become a very interesting endeavor. Metaphysical topics attract me. I'm interested in news - reporting human issues like injustice, discrimination and abuse - the "wrongly" affected. My intention is to bring this knowledge to an understandable level and to help anyone in need. I'm open to questions and will answer them to the best of my ability. Currently working on an enterprise whose main mission will be to bring peoples of all walks of life together. To be one .... since we ALL are ONE!! The future looks bright and promising!!!
