 You can easily create a careers page hosted on your company's website with the Workable job widget. The widget is a few lines of code that you copy and paste onto your website. It will display your published positions automatically, all with your custom styling and formatting. 
 
 Accessing the widget 
 To access the job widget, navigate to the   Integrations  section of your account by clicking your profile icon in the upper right. Then click on   Company Website . 
 Start by selecting the organization options for your jobs. Choose to display them by location or department and then refine the details of what is displayed below. 
 As you select different options, the code beneath the options will update. When you're happy with the layout you selected, copy the code and have it added to your website on your careers page. 
 Note for WordPress users:  If you plan to insert the code in a WordPress post, then  this plugin  can be used. If you prefer to insert the code on a different page of your WordPress site (page, sidebar, etc.), then  this plugin  should work better. 
 
 Embedded job examples 
 Initial listing by job, Group by location: 
 Initial listing by location, showing state/region:

 Extra customization 
 The embedded widget can be  further customized with CSS and Javascript . Change the specifics of what's displayed (e.g. hide jobs in certain departments), update the padding, color and background for different elements, display a custom message if no jobs are available and more.
