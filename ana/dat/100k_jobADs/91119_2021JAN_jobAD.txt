 More about this opening 
 In Backbase, I learn something new every single day. Working on Service SDK is challenging but exciting at the same time. Backbase is definitely a place to be if you want to constantly evolve and grow as a professional. 
 Allie Ward Senior QA Engineer, UK Hub 
 I'm a huge fan of diversity at Backbase. I love the freedom and ownership opportunities at work. I'm proud of the new solution that we are building. We had a simple idea and the solution that I've proposed is the one that we are working on. 
 Hari Vignesh Android Engineer, EMEA Hub 
 What excites me most about working at Backbase is understanding the diverse needs of our customers and working with the team to solve them within the real-world constraints. 
 Grace Brady Product Owner, EMEA Hub 
 Call me crazy but I love my job. I get paid to work on puzzles with my friends, play pool and learn new tech. 
 Patrick Newcombe Senior Full Stack Engineer, UK Hub 
 The biggest challenge I overcame with my team was creating an entirely new mobile product from scratch, aligning an entirely new team with people from very different backgrounds and creating a way of working which has the DNA of Backbase in it. 
 Harneek Singh Senior QA Engineer, EMEA Hub 
 Bringing a mobile-first approach to an industry with brick and mortar companies is not about the solutions or products you deliver but about that mentor-mentee relationship you develop with them along the way. 
 Tibor Beke Android Engineer, EMEA Hub

 THE JOB AT BACKBASE 
 As Product Owner, you are working in one of the tribes within our Products Department. A Backbase tribe contains 2 to 4 squads (Scrum teams), each consisting of 12 people max. You’ll be responsible for those features created by around 20 to 30 people, and will work with a Development Manager who’s in charge of timely delivery and quality, while you manage what we create, for whom, why and in which priority. Simultaneously, you have to make sure that products and features your tribe creates are presented in the most beneficial way: from product demos to presentations and marketing collateral, you are in charge. 
 Still here? Good! We are glad you know what it means to solve complex, functional and analytical problems, and that you have our customer top of mind. We are also glad you get things done while keeping team members highly productive. You will spend time with our customers to understand their challenges, gathering insights into how to solve problems and deliver new features. You translate customer opportunities and pain points into detailed product requirements.  apply now
