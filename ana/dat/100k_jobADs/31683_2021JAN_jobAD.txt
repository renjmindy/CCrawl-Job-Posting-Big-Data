 My thoughts on Hurricane Sandy 
 Posted on  November 2, 2012March 2, 2017  by  themillennialperspective 
 My thoughts on Hurricane Sandy: 
 Well, first of all I would like to say RIP to the deceased, and for those people out there that lost homes, lost jobs, etc. because of it, I hope all the best to you. 
 But honestly, it we knew this was going to happen. Many scientists have been saying, even Al Gore, a previous vice president said that this would happen in his movie: An Inconvenient Truth. There were specials on CNN more frequently as time went on about the possibilities of hurricanes. So the people who are surprised by this really didn‚Äôt have their eyes open much. It‚Äôs kind of like the British Columbia ‚ÄúBig One‚Äù earthquake that we have been expecting all my life, and anyone who knows anything about Geology knows that it will happen in my life time for sure, yet so many people just blow it off like it‚Äôs an annoying joke. Stuff like this IS GOING TO HAPPEN, as much as it suck to believe and experience, and it will happen again. Prepare for the worst, and spend money on protecting citizens instead of Wall Street. 
 Global warming is not even worth arguing about anymore. If you don‚Äôt see it for yourself, you‚Äôre an idiot. Storms like this are happening way more frequently, ice caps are melting, and seasons are getting way more intense respectively. Personally, I suggested avoiding affected areas, but in the event of Sandy, that leaves out way too many states, however, you can avoid places like New Orleans or countries like Haiti if you wish to avoid the stress of dealing with situations like this, and hey, I‚Äôve never experience a hurricane in Beautiful British Columbia, maybe after the ‚ÄúBig One‚Äù you could move here. üòâ 
 Many people don‚Äôt know or understand the Gaia Hypothesis, it is Mother Nature‚Äôs way of cleansing itself, no matter what. Perhaps the abundance of deadly storms is Her way of trying to cleanse herself of man. She will one day I believe. Global warming is just a theory as to how. 
 After this sort of thing I ponder how evolution may have devolved some of our senses. Query, what sense is it to continue living in an area that is constantly affected by natural disasters? I believe our ancestors would have sought shelter elsewhere probably after the second natural disaster to hit them, maybe even the first. Yet, people repeatedly just take the abuse from mother nature. Indeed, it is probably a money issue, but ultimately you would still end up saving it if you moved away. You wouldn‚Äôt have to constantly rebuild every year. Perhaps it‚Äôs emotional attachment. This wouldn‚Äôt have even been considered by ancestors, to them, their lives were more important than memories. 
 Right now people are debating whether or not the New York City Marathon should take place, this is a strange notion to me. On one hand I think the people who want to run should be able to run. Why not make a flash group or something and do it anyways even if the mayor calls it off? On the other hand, lots of the city is destroyed, without power, and without basic supplies, so we need to focus on helping those people. But just because they are in turmoil doesn‚Äôt mean people should be prohibited to run. Do what you want people, but still focus on helping your fellow man. Personally, if I lived in New York and was unaffected by this, I would still donate money, clothes, whatever others in my city who were less fortunate than I had been needs to get back on track. But the world doesn‚Äôt work like that. People are thrown out of their homes, and people are bankrupted for political gain. It‚Äôs too bad good people are so few and far between, when stuff like this happens, there‚Äôs just enough of them to get by. 
 I wish everyone in New York and other affected areas the best. You're in my thoughts, and prayers.
