 Backbase Careers 
 you impact 
 an industry 
 SALES 
 Banking is changing rapidly. We’re on a mission to serve 10% of all smartphone users worldwide with a Backbase-powered financial app. Yes, that means 400 million people. Ambitious? Yes. Challenging? Absolutely. But we see it as exploring millions of initiatives and flexing our brainpower. 
 Our Sales team is a key element in achieving this mission. We are passionate about technology and customer-centric solutions. Here, we impact an industry beyond just selling software by changing the way people experience banking globally. 
 team  challenge 
 SALES 
 We are industry distributors. We know that our solution is the best possible in the niche market but if you think that winning clients over comes by itself, think again. At Backbase, you get to combine your passion for sales and technology to gain trust and understand clients’ needs. It’s not an easy task! It’s your job to work together with Solution Engineers and our Professional Service experts to explain to the biggest financial institutions globally how to drive innovation and provide a flawless user experience on every touchpoint. 
 Of course, it comes with additional benefits. Our Sales team is relatively small, so with your can-do attitude and entrepreneurial mindset, you’d be able to make a difference within the industry. A happy customer means a positive impact on the lives of millions of end-users around the world. 
 explore the world 
 Traveling is a big part of your job: whether you represent Backbase at a conference or onsite of the client, if you don’t have that frequent flyer card, you’d gain one pretty quickly. 
 high-value deals 
 Our clients are the biggest financial institution around the world. So you can imagine - the deals that we close are massive and responsibility is high. 
 ahead of tech 
 We believe that innovation should keep moving forward. That’s why we constantly re-invest in our product to make it better for our customers. 
 fun 
 Friday beers, yearly parties, team outings, Strong Vikings competitions, travels around the world. Here, you’d build real friendships. 
 team  structure 
 SALES 
 For the size of the organization (850+ people), we have a rather small Global Sales team, counting around 60 Sales Representatives in 11 offices across the world. Our SVP of Sales (located in Amsterdam HQ) is leading the team and strategy. Together with Regional Sales Directors and their teams of Account Executives and Business Development Representatives, they are responsible for achieving the yearly revenue and customer acquisition goals. 
 The majority of the Sales team is based in our Amsterdam HQ but we also have small local sales teams based in the US ( Atlanta & Princeton), Frankfurt, Mexico, Dubai, Singapore, Japan, India and Australia which helps us to be closer and stay relevant to the clients in the area.
