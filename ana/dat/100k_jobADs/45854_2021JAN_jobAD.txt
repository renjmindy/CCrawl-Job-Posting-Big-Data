 JOB SKILLS 
 wcpbyjoegardner  /  October 25, 2015 
 Then the Lord said to Satan, 
“Behold, all that he has 
Is in your power, 
Only do not put forth 
Your hand on him” 
So Satan departed from the presence of the Lord… 
Book of Job 1:12 
Suffer 
They say suffer 
It’s good for the soul 
And builds character 
And a charge account 
With the good Lord 
 Suffer 
They say suffer 
Be like the dollar 
Eagerly passed hand to hand 
Something to be 
Bartered and gambled 
 Give praise to the Lord 
Give praise 
Lift your hands 
Jesus saves 
 Didn’t you see the neon sign? 
A thin bowl of soup 
And a mean blanket cold 
So suffer the Lord 
Suffer… 
 “I have heard of Thee 
By the hearing of the ear: 
But now my eyes see Thee: 
Therefore I retract, 
And I repent in dust and ashes” 
Book of Job 42: 5/6
