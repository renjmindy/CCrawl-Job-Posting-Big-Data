 We are working with a progressive organisation to help them hire a Project Manager for a 3 month contract as they look to onboard a number of newly acquired sites as a result of a recent acquisition. This role can be based remotely from anywhere in the UK. 
 As Project Manager you will take the lead mapping out, tracking and closing off actions brought about through the acquisition of new businesses. You will make sure compliance actions are carried out and ensure that the project plan is managed and scheduled correctly. You will interact with the existing supply chain and possibly set up new relationships whilst communicating, tracking and managing tasks. 
 In this role as Project Manager you will work remotely with one -off visits to 5 sites in Scotland, Cheshire, Cambridgeshire and Hampshire. Reporting into the Property & Compliance team the Project Manager will have a project management background within property, transformation, procurement, finance and/or IT and ideally have PRINCE2 training (ideal but not essential). Most importantly you will be able to demonstrate successfully undertaking similar roles in the past and delivering against tight deadlines in a diverse project management role. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
