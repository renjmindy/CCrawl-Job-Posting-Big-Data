 2 ways a Church Planter's Job is Different 
 
 Yesterday at our monthly Church Planting Network meeting in Atlanta, the-one-and-only Dr. Bob Burns led our training on  Resilient Ministry . If you are a church planter (or go to a church plant) and there is a desire to survive and flourish in ministry,  this book  has some great data and insight. And as a church planter coach, I have a suggestion. 
 It makes the case for  gospel coaching  for church planters with just two insights. 
 1. Church planting is non-stop.  Being a pastor is "taxing, fast-paced and unrelenting" according to Dr. Bob and his research. Unrelenting resonates. I've been in pastoral ministry for over 25 years in a variety of roles. As a pastor, your "job" is never done. As a planter? There is always more to do. Times ten. 
 More. To. Do. Now. Faster. 
 It's a job without any boundaries. Unlike other jobs, where you get to go home, life and ministry blur together and overlap and go really fast. 
 2. Church planters live in "GO" mode.  The research showed that pastors "rarely re-charge and reflect". Dr. Bob said that pastors do less self-care than every single profession except one. I'll let you guess which one is worse. 
 As a planter, I was ON all the time. All the time. If I hadn't had a coach who pointed me to Christ and challenged me kindly and firmly, I would have run myself ragged, ignored my wife and sacrificed my children to succeed in planting a church. 
 Care about a church planter? Encourage him to talk to one of our gospel coaches at  CMM  who can help him learn how to manage and thrive in a non-stop calling. 
 Then offer to pay. It will multiply benefits to his soul, his family and the church.
