 Looking for a software developer to join this start-up from day one and help build the product from the ground up! 
 ECE is building a multi-component automated software platform and app that helps small and medium sized businesses calculate and manage their environmental impact with ease. 
 This role is initially part-time and unpaid so ideal for a graduate or furloughed developer! We are currently raising capital and with investment the role will move to full-time with a starting salary of gross £1,500/month, and then rising to gross £2,500/month after 6 months. We will also backpay you for all the work you completed while part-time! 
 The role is completely remote and flexible - you will be working one-on-one with the founder to design and create the platform. 
 We are gathering up a team of committed people with a passion for environmental sustainability who want to build something brand new in the industry that can really make a difference!
