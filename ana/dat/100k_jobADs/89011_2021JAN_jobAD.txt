 Deshaun Watson Caps Off Clemson Career With Performance for the Ages Against Alabama in Title Game 
 January 10, 2017   TheFCC   Leave a comment 
 When Alabama took a 14-0 lead at the beginning of the second quarter during the College Football Playoff National Championship Game on Monday night, how many of you thought Clemson was going to be able to come back and make the game competitive, let alone win? Ha. Donâ€™t lie.  No one  thought it was going to happen, and truth be told, 14-0 may as well have been 35-0 at that point. 
 
 Bama with a 14-0 lead and Clemson making mistakes=game over. Yawn.  #titlegamesareboring   #collegefootballisnofun

 It's 14-0 but this game feels over already. Clemson can't get started on offense

 Heard it's 14-0 Bama already! GAME OVER! What's the use on even watching?  #NiteNite

 But Clemsonâ€”led by their star quarterback  Deshaun Watson â€”  did  start staging a comeback a short time later, and by the end of the contest, it was anybody's game. 
 Watson ran for a touchdown to make the score 14-7 before half, threw for another touchdown midway through the third quarter to make it 17-14, and threw for another TD at the start of the fourth to pull Clemson back to within 24-21 after Alabama freshman QB Jalen Hurts hit an impressive 68-yard TD of his own. And then, after some back-and-forth scoring throughout the fourth quarter, Watson threw for his third TD of the game with just one second remaining on the clock and his team trailing by three points to give Clemson a 35-31 lead and, eventually, a CFP National Championship Game victory.

 Watson finished the gameâ€”and more than likely, his collegiate careerâ€”with 36 completions on 56 attempts for 420 yards and the aforementioned three TDs against Alabama. He also ran for 43 yards on 21 attempts and somehow managed to survive this hit, which pretty much epitomized what he had to deal with from the Alabama defense all night long: 
 And when it was all over, Watson was predictably overcome with emotion. He said he was "speechless" during his postgame interview: 
 Most of the people who watched the game, including quite a few college and pro players, were left speechless by what Watson was able to do, too. Those outside the state of Alabama were happy to see Watsonâ€”who was named the offensive player of the game after it endedâ€”get a win, especially after he and the Tigers  came so close to upsetting Alabama in last seasonâ€™s CFP National Championship Game :

 -- Dick Vitale (@DickieV)  January 10, 2017 
 
 
 After tonight, there's really no debate: Deshaun Watson is the greatest player in  #Clemson  football history.

 Many fans were also already predicting that Watsonâ€™s legendary performance will help his NFL Draft stock in the spring: 
 
 Well Deshaun Watson's draft stock has just risen 
 -- LeadingNFL â„¢ (@LeadingNFL)  January 10, 2017 
 
 
 "With the 1st pick in the 2017 NFL draft, the Cleveland browns select, Deshaun Watson" calling it 
 -- Evan (@emaurer89)  January 10, 2017 
 
 And while that remains to be seen, one thing is for sure: Watson once told the world exactly what he was going to do one day if and when he ever got the opportunity to play in a national championship gameâ€¦ 
 
 If I get a chance to play in a national championship game, Imma go ham. 
 -- Deshaun Watson (@DeshaunWatson4)  February 5, 2012 
 
 â€¦then, he told everyone againâ€¦ 
 
 Me. In a National Championship Game. I'm just waiting on that moment. 
 -- Deshaun Watson (@DeshaunWatson4)  January 8, 2013 
 
 And although he came up short last season, he more than made up for it in 2017. What a special performance from a special athlete.

 The Pleiades (M45) is the most famous star cluster in the sky. It lies 444 light-years away in the constellation Taurus the Bull. The clouds of gas seen in this image are not connected to the stars, but are a dust cloud through which the cluster is passing. Dave Doctor from Las Cruces, New Mexico

 The Orion Nebula (M42) may be the most photographed deep-sky object of all. Itâ€™s a huge emission nebula and star-forming complex. In addition to the glowing hydrogen, however, the object also has regions of both reflection and dark nebulae. James Esch from Lovettsville, Virginia
