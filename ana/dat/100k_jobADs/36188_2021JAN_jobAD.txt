 Home  -  From Job Search to Employment  -  Looking for job 
 Looking for job – you can find help in lots of places 
 Where and how can I look for a job? There’s a wide range of possibilities… 
 Federal employment agency 
 Germany’s best-known, official job portal is run by its Federal Employment Agency (Bundesagentur für Arbeit). The Federal Employment Agency is a state body that helps people in Germany and abroad find employment and training positions. The agency’s website lets you carry out a targeted search for suitable jobs on its Job Board (Jobbörse). The Jobbörse is available in German, English, French, Spanish, Italian, Turkish and Russian. 
 International Placement Services (ZAV) 
 Have you not yet moved to Germany but are already looking for a job there? If you don’t yet live in Germany but are interested in working there, you can get help from the International Placement Services (Zentrale Auslands- und Fachvermittlung; ZAV). The ZAV is run by the Federal Employment Agency. Some of its main responsibilities include the consultancy and mediation services it provides to certain occupational groups around the world, and it can help you become integrated on the German labour market. 
 EURES: The European job mobility portal 
 The European Employment Service (EURES) is a European-wide network that promotes international mobility on the labour market. The network can offer you interesting job perspectives and funding programmes. The EURES Internet portal will let you know which EURES consultants are available in your country. You can also visit the EURES Internet portal to find job offers from 31 European countries, information on living standards and working conditions in each country, and the contact details of EURES consultants. The portal is available in 25 languages. 
 Job portals 
 Many German companies don’t just advertise their vacancies through official institutions; they also post their job adverts online. Online job boards have filters to make it easier to find the right job offer, such as by choosing between fields of work and qualifications. Some of the biggest job portals are monster.de, kimeta and jobs.de. 
 Company websites 
 Research which German companies are particularly suitable for your profession. Many of these companies will often advertise vacancies on their websites. These sections of their websites are usually called “Stellenangebote” (“vacancies") or “Karriere” (“careers”). 
 Newspapers 
 In Germany, public job advertisements are also placed in local daily newspapers. Job offers for managerial positions can be found in national daily newspapers. A box number is often given in job advertisements, and you shouldn’t forget this when making your application. You can buy local and national newspapers in supermarkets and at kiosks. 
 Recruitment fairs 
 Recruitment fairs offer you the perfect opportunity to meet companies – and especially your potential colleagues – in person and get an overview of the businesses available. Recruitment fairs are made up of different stands where companies introduce themselves and recruit new staff. One of the biggest fairs is the Absolventenkongress in Cologne. Whatever you do, don’t forget to take your application documents with you.
