 Sims 4 Get To Work: Scientist Career â€“ Gameplay Bugs & Thoughts 
 June 23 2015 
 Yes, the scientist is Sims 4  Dr Prometheus Hyde  , the Watcher of the  STM  Universe. 
 
 The middle levels of the science career have nice  light blue lab coats  ðŸ™‚ That's what  FutureSims Lab  has in common with  Hyde Dynamic . 
 
 I initially thought of reassigning the careers of the relevant  STM  sims, so they can all work together here in nice blue lab coats. Unfortunatelyâ€¦ 
 
 Many of the work-related goals are  to  experiment on one 's coworkers . Use the  Sim Ray  to freeze or mind-control coworkers, test serums or tainted serums on coworkers. 
 
 While Nervous Subject was the Beakers' guinea pig,  STM  Bianca Monty, Kent Capp, Vidcund Curious and the Racing Men are NOT exactly my test subjects in that same sense. It's much "easier" to do these things on random townie coworkers. 
 
 
 
 However, on the bright side, the  scientist coworkers  do actually experiment, and  can be "ordered" to do constructive things  like gardening, cleaning, building the rocket, or experimentation on various substances. 
 
 
 FutureSims Lab has many nice "toys". I find the  Invention Constructor  to be the most fascinating attraction  (see first pic)  , with interesting animations and invented products (  Sim Ray  ,  Satellite Dish  ,  Cloning Machine  ,  Wormhole Generator  etc). It is also particularly endearing to be able to converse with the Robot. 
 
 
 However, the Invention Constructor  cannot  be unlocked for home use, not even in debug mode. So scientists can only invent during working hours, which is particularly annoying if I want to create multiple copies of the same device. 
 
 
 
 Sim metals, crystals and elements have pseudo-scientific names, which puts them in a whole new classification that I consider  " Sims Science" , as opposed to the real-world science that I'm familiar with. 
 
 
 Sometimes, I don't have the required metals, crystals or plants required to  synthesize serums  or to  create the inventions  , and may not be able to procure them  on time  to achieve the day's objectives. 
 
 
 I find the  lab layout  to be inefficient, as too many precious sim minutes are wasted on walking/running from one point to another. 
 
 
 That's why I don't bother climbing all the way up to the  Observatory  at the Lab's roof, but only use the one at home. Similarly, when  chasing down coworkers to use the Sim-Ray  on,  too much time  is spent on footâ€¦ 
 
 
 
 For the  " Restocking Day" Work Program , where my scientist must dig up many new metals and crystals, I could never finish the day with Gold performance (even after staying late), because too much time is wasted on walking/running from one digging point to another. 
 
 
 So when I get the requisite number of  Breakthroughs  for promotion, I send my scientist "alone" to work, starting with the  Very Focused  emotion, and ending with the  Tense  emotion for having worked too hard, but  Happy  at being promoted. 
 
 
 The L9-10 futuristic  black lab coat  with the  bionic arm  is excellent. 
 
 
 
Sim-Ray  Transformed Sims  may end up with different hair colors or skin tones, and a  " Transformed" (Happy +1, 2 days) moodlet . The effects of this transformation appear to be  temporary  , as this sim reverted to his original hair color and skin tone after the moodlet lapsed. 
 
 - The  Wormhole Generator  is awesomely  Fringesque . But the  Rocket Science  method leaves my Scientist more appropriately-attired for his visit to  Sixam . 
 
 The  aliens  go by surprisingly Earth-like names, even when  undisguised  on Sixam. But this is likely because the game recognizes only one "full name" per sim. So the only listed name is how aliens introduce themselves to their human visitors, and what they go by when  disguised  on Earth. 
 
 
 
 After my  Scientist reached L10  , he received an invitation to attend an  alien party at Sixam  , during working hours. Fulfilling goals at this party fills up the job performance meter. 
 
 So it's a good idea to  prepare in advance  , before your scientist reaches L10: Invent & upgrade the Electroflux Wormhole Generator, and/or Build the Rocket & Install the Wormhole Generator upgrade (requires L10 Rocket Science Skill). 
 I'll leave you with some  pics of my Sixam Alien Party  ðŸ™‚ Frankly, Hyde's L10 black science labcoat doesn't look too different from the aliens' outfitsâ€¦
