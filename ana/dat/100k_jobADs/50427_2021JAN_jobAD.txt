 Not Sure Where - Or How - To Begin Your Job Search? Our Job Search Guide For Working Mums Will Help. 
 9/20/2016 
  1 Comment  
 If it has been a long while since you looked for a job, you probably don't quite remember where - or how - to begin. Plus you may have found that the job search process has changed rapidly over the past few years... 
 It takes a lot more than a stelar CV and few online job postings to find your ideal job these days, particularly if you're looking for a high-level part-time or flexible role. It requires an understanding and readiness to implement proven techniques for networking, prospecting, interviewing, social media marketing and following up - in short, you need a proactive strategy and plan in place that focuses on every aspect of the job hunt. 
 Whether you are ready to dive into your job search or are just beginning to explore your options, I hope our  Step-By-Step Guide To A Successful Job Search  will help you organise and structure your job hunt, and keep you on track. 
 You can find the guide  here  in our Resource Hub. 
 And of course, if you'd like our help keeping focused and motivated, or to glean helpful insights into how to make your job search experience the most effective it can be, please do  get in touch . We're right here with you and cheering you on every step of the way. 
 To your job search success! ​
