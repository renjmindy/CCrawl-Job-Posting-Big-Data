 Carl the Career Bear 
 Carl was created as a way to assist educators with career exploration at the elementary level. Due to safety regulations and increased liability issues it is no longer possible for elementary students to tour our local industries. Carl allows our elementary students a first hand view at what careers are available locally without having to scour youtube for videos that are not part of our community.
