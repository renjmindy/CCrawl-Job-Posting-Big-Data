 Role overview 
 At PathAI, we're applying Machine Learning, Computer Vision and AI in amazing ways to pathology, healthcare, and detecting cancer and other diseases. We're applying our work to drug development, the clinical space, and as a global health initiative. Since it's early days for us, there's a lot of work to do and a lot of great product to build, and we recognize that a great, polished, engaging experience is critical to the success of everything we aspire to do. 
 We're looking for skilled and experienced engineers to join our team and help lay the groundwork for our growing software platform. We believe in using the best tool for the job. While weâ€™re always looking to improve, in this role, those tools currently include: 
 
 Python/Django 
 Django REST framework 
 PostgreSQL 
 VueJS 
 
 If you're the right candidate, you'll be exercising all the skills you have and building new ones along the way: 
 
 Solve interesting problems with code. 
 Build new features for internal and external users, and refactor existing ones to make them better. 
 Work with a wide range of systems, processes, and technologies to solve problems in sustainable ways. Sometimes you'll be neck-deep in low-level systems, and other times you'll be pairing up with the front-end team on the user interface. 
 Drive the architecture of our application platform, considering the team and our future product roadmap. 
 Collaborate with product, design, front-end, machine learning, and infrastructure teams. 
 Drive and uphold high engineering standards, bringing consistency to the codebases you encounter and ensuring software is adequately reviewed, tested, and integrated. 
 Mentor, learn, and share knowledge with others along the way. 
 
 Requirements 
 Our employees come in all shapes and sizes, but to be successful in this role with us, you'll at least need: 
 
 Experience. You've been around the block a more than a couple times, typically via 5+ years of work in this field. 
 Education. Generally, a bachelor's degree is really helpful in working with our team on this kind of work. But feel free to convince us if you're the exception. 
 An insatiable intellectual curiosity and the ability to learn quickly in a complex space 
 
 Benefits 
 For the right candidate, we'll offer a competitive salary plus equity. Your compensation is rounded out by a strong benefits package: 
 
 Flexible work hours, with work-from-home options available for many roles 
 Three weeks of paid leave per year, an additional two weeks of sick time, plus extended holidays and team-approved leave 
 Ten days of 100% subsidized childcare per year 
 Healthcare, vision, and dental insurance plans (HMO or PPO), with voluntary add-ons available for dependent care, life, and accident coverage 
 Commuter benefit available for public transit or parking 
 Convertible sit-stand desks 
 Weekly in-office yoga classes 
 Free in-office lunch on Tuesdays and Fridays 
 Snacks and drinks in the office â€“ which currently include a mountain of Milano cookies, endless Fruit Snacks, as well as cold brew coffee and kombucha on tap, among many other options. Our in-house Snackologist is also happy to take your requests! 
 
 Most importantly, you'll be doing important work with a team of people you'll genuinely enjoy spending the day with.
