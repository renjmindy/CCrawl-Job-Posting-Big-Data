 Web Developer with Craft CMS, Craft Commerce Experience REMOTEPERMANENT 
 Job Description 
 This position is perfect for a highly skilled freelancer who is sick of trying to find projects. This job is a LOT like freelancing, but without the crushing loneliness and constant cash-flow issues. 
 Paper Tiger is a New Jersey-based design agency catering to high-end clients. Our focus is primarily on interface design, user experience design, and branding. We also offer web development services for CMS-driven sites using Craft CMS, Craft Commerce, Shopify, WordPress, and Squarespace. 
 Our work environment is relaxed, creative, humorous, and simple. Our projects are often complex, deadline-driven, and diverse. We are looking for someone who enjoys jumping back-and-forth between technologies and works pretty quickly. 
 This position is for an in-house developer with deep experience in HTML/CSS/JS and a love for Craft CMS and Craft Commerce. Experience with Shopify, Squarespace, and WordPress aren't required but would be great. You will often be the only developer on a project, starting with technical consultation during wire-framing, and ending with the development and deployment of the work. 
 Requirements 
 
 Provide technical consultation during the wireframe and design phases of a project. 
 Convert  Sketch, Figma, and Photoshop  design files to responsive HTML/CSS/Javascript. 
 Integrate front-end code with CMS/E-Commerce systems like Craft, Craft Commerce, Shopify, WordPress, and Squarespace. 
 Troubleshoot, enhance, and repair complex websites for some of our existing clients. 
 Provide CMS user documentation in the form of screencasts or written instructions. Train clients to use the websites you build. 
 
 Benefits 
 We offer Health/Dental/Vision benefits to anyone inside the United States. We also offer commuter benefits to candidates who are in the NY/NJ area and can work from our office.
