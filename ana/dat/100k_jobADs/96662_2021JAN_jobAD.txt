 Jobs in Learning Measurement -- Let's Try Something   
 Learning Industry ,  Learning Measurement ,  Your Input Requested 
 Dear Readers, 
 Many of you are now following me and my social-media presence because you're interested in LEARNING MEASUREMENT. Probably because of my recent book on Performance-Focused Smile Sheets (which you can learn about at the book's website,  SmileSheets.com ). 
 More and more, I'm meeting people who have jobs that focus on learning measurement. For some, that's their primary focus. For most, it's just a part of their job. 
 Today, I got an email from a guy looking for a job in learning measurement and analytics. He's a good guy, smart and passionate, and so he ought to be able to find a good job where he can really help. So here's what I'm thinking. You, my readers are some of the best and brightest in the industry -- you care about our work and you look to the scientific research as a source of guidance. You are also, many of you, enlightened employers, looking to recruit and hire the best and brightest. So it seems obvious that I should try to connect you… 
 So here's what we'll try. If you've got a job in learning measurement, let me know about it. I'll post it here on my blog. This will be an experiment to see what happens. Maybe nothing… but it's worth a try. 
 Now, I know many of you are also loyal readers because of things BESIDES learning measurement, for example, learning research briefs, research-based insights, elearning, subscription learning, learning audits, and great jokes… but let's keep this experiment to LEARNING MEASUREMENT JOBS at first. 
 BOTTOM LINE: If you know of a learning-measurement job, let me know. [Email me here…](mailto: info@work-learning.com)
