 Farmwork in Ireland 
 Staying and working on a farm in Ireland 
 Set out on an adventure with a job on a farm in Ireland and find out what it feels like to live and work abroad! In Ireland we offer jobs in agriculture. You get free accommodation and meals in exchange for your work! 
 Most farms in Ireland focus on cattle and dairy farming, keeping cows and sheep. Did you know that Ireland is world renowned for its dairy produce? A temperate climate and plenty of rainfall make Ireland naturally suited to grass-based farming: Irish dairy cows graze on lush pastures almost all year round which makes the excellent quality of Irish dairy products! 
 Imagine the lush green pastures right in front of you early in the morning, embedded in a gentle hilly landscape. The air smells fresh like after a light summer rain and you feel delicate layers of fog, which slowly but surely evaporate in the rays of the morning sun. The cows are welcoming you with a happy mooing, eagerly waiting for you to milk them! Are you ready to start your working day? 
 What is the job about? 
 We facilitate jobs on various farms in Ireland. Most of them are doing cattle and dairy farms, keeping around 50 to 500 cows. Some farms are mixed farms, which means that besides cows there might also be pigs or other animals. Due to the climate, however, there are very few farms in Ireland that rely on crop-farming only. Also there is virtually no farming labelled as "organic farming" as most farms have always been keeping their animals outside on the natural pastures. So anyone coming to Ireland to gain experience in agriculture should therefore enjoy working with lifestock! 
 How can you get involved? 
 Working on a farm in Ireland is fun and diverse! You will take care of the cows and calves and take on tasks independently, such as feeding and milking the animals. Many farms will calve during the early spring time, and this is an excellent time for you to get a great experience and learn a lot. If you are lucky, you can be there when a calf is born and welcome it to the farm! 
 On mixed farms you can also help with the care of other animals and swing yourself on the tractor to go out on the field - for example to repair fences or to bring in the harvest. Every day is a little different here, so you definitely won't get bored! 
 The jobs are unpaid, but you will get free accommodation and meals provided by your workplace in exchange for your work. 
 Working in Ireland will not only allow you to travel abroad and get international experience, but you will also acquire practical skills that can be extremely valuable for your resume or your future studies / training! Another great side effect: while working in Ireland, you will improve your English skills by speaking the language in your daily life, i.e. with your local colleagues! 
 What are your working times? 
 You will work 5 days a week for about 40-45 hours and have 2 days off a week. Since there is always a lot to do on farms, your days off do not necessarily fall on the weekends. If you work on the weekends, you will have days off during the week instead. 
 The exact working hours depend on the farm and can vary - depending on the tasks to be done! Being flexible and a hands-on mentality are key skills if you would like to gain a foothold in farming. 
 What previous knowledge do you need? 
 No knowledge or previous work experience is required. 
 The farmers will show you on site what is important when working with the animals. You shouldn't be afraid of physical work and shouldn't mind getting your hands dirty at work. Watch our video about working on Irish farms to get an idea of ​​what to expect on site. 
 Of course, if you already have experience, this won't hurt either. If you are looking for an internship for your studies or vocational training in agriculture, our placements are a perfect match for you, too: Let us know the requirements of your university / school for the internship and we will find a suitable placement for you. During the entire internship, you will be guided and supervised by experts from your area of interest, to make sure you’ll have the best possible learning effect! 
 Internships are possible! 
 If you are looking for an agriculture internship for your studies or your vocational training, we can also arrange it! Please tell us the requirements of your school/university and we will find a suitable agriculture internship in Ireland for you. During the internship, you will have a professional supervisor making sure there is a maximum learning outcome for you!
