  Poll: How Did You Land Your First Job After College?  
 Belen Chacon 
 April 02, 2013 
 One of the things all college graduates look forward after college is finding their  first job . They've spent years getting an education and now they’re ready for some professional experience to help pay for those college loans. For some grads, it’s been difficult to land that first job shortly after graduating college. Some can’t get any interviews while others get several interviews, but no job offers. There are many reasons why some college grads can’t find a work after college. However, we seldom hear about how  hired  graduates landed their job. If you’ve recently graduated from college and have a job, how did you land your first job after college? Please take our poll and tell us what you think in the comment section below!
