 Job-work Processing in Danger of Closure in India 
 This entry was posted on Saturday, March 16th, 2013 and is filed under Cashew . 
 Indian raw cashew importers may not immediately stop Job-work processing in others' factories but this system is now teetering on the brink of collapse. If the Indian pieces-splits and lower grades market follows the global market, Indian importers can not bear the import related extra charges and ever-increasing processing expenses. 
 Production cost is cheapest in the African countries but this expense is more than double in the western parts of India. 
 However, Indians always get a bumper Diwali bonanza for 3-4 months in a year.
