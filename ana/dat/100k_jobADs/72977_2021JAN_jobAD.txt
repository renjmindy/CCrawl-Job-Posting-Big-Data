 About CodeStream 
 CodeStream's IDE plugins take the pain out of code reviews. With one command, request feedback on a snapshot of your repo, including uncommitted & unpushed code, allowing you to verify that your work-in-progress is on the right track. (You can also do it the old-fashioned way by committing & pushing at the end of your dev sprint, of course) 
 About the role 
 Skills:  CSS, HTML, React, TypeScript 
 Looking for developers to build developer collaboration into popular IDEs using React/Redux, Node, Mongo and AWS. As with most startups the role requires enthusiastic, bright, motivated individuals who can take projects from conception to completion. Our team has NYC roots, with half the employees working from an office there, and half working remotely, so you may come into the NY office if that's convenient, otherwise work from home.
