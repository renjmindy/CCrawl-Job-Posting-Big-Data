 First Job Interview in Review 
 I'm calling this post the first job interview, but in all honesty, I hope I get this job and won't have to apply for any others. It's for teaching at a local university. They asked me to come in and teach a class, which I did, and I think it went pretty well. The students clapped at the end. I'm not sure what to think of that since they also clapped when I figured out the light switches. (We were doing a demo that required darkness.) 
 Overall, I think it went pretty well, except for one thing. They want someone who can teach upper division and graduate classes as well. I didn't answer those questions right because a) I have low self-confidence, b) I didn't want to impose on anyone's current schedule, c) I never picked up on the clue that this was something they  wanted  and  needed  , otherwise, I think I might have walked out much better situated. I didn't get the  click  that this was what they wanted to hear until I was driving the hour-long commute home. DH says I would sound too much like an eager puppy-dog if I tried to call or email them now to explain that yes, I would teach those classes. Ugh. I need to wait on pins and needles for the next few weeks and see what happens. 
 I wasn't hypomanic either. If I had been, I may have been less hesitant and more willing to commit to those upper level courses. I should be happy that I had a stable day, but it's screwed me in the long run! Can't I ever win? 
 This second anti-psychotic seems to keep me in check better than the Geodon (or maybe it's the combination). The stuff makes me sick to my stomach after I take it (think near dry heaves for about 30min-hr) but maybe that side effect will go away. I forget to take it every day and that seems to make a difference. I am better on days when I remembered to take it the night before. 
 Anyway, the most stress of the day came when I got home after having reviewed the entire day in my head during the hour-long drive home. I was so worked up that I had to take extra Klonopin and sleep on the couch. A lot of the interview was good, but the answer to this question was horrible. Stupid, stupid, stupid. How can I fix it? 
 Suggestions, thoughts, prayers, and hugs are welcome!

 I would send a follow-up thank-you note (always good form, really) and in it, mention that you would be excited at the opportunity to teach upper-level and graduate courses. Don't explain yourself or anything, just say that it's something you'd be happy to do.

 Thank you so much DeeDee! I was already thinking of doing that, but I have trouble with the exact wording. When they asked me what I could teach, I only mentioned one class. There were leading questions like "Is that all?" but it didn't click. It didn't help that I was intimidated out of a class I enjoy by one of the theorists. Not a terribly helpful fellow since he started our discussion with: "I'm very busy," and then kept re-iterating it. Everyone else I really liked, and seemed to get along with pretty well. I know I have the research skills they desperately need right now. I just hope it's enough.

 BTW, DeeDee, I think I patched things up as much as I could in the follow-up/thank you email. I just hope the dept chair reads it and believes it. And I hope the other candidates aren't as good as me! ðŸ˜‰

 I can't say that I have any pertinent suggestions, but I offer you good thoughts, prayers (this may not mean anything to you, but my patron saint, Saint Frances de Sales, is the patron saint of teachers as well, so I will send my prayers for you to him especially), positive energy, and virtual (((HUGS))).
