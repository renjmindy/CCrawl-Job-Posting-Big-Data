  Why EVERY Career Roadblock Starts With YOU  
 Work It Daily 
 July 20, 2009 
 By J.T. O'Donnell In CAREEREALISM University, we teach participants the new rules to job search in today's changing professional landscape. The step-by-step process includes video segments where we outline key learning points. The segment above is a crucial one for those who are looking for a job. Like all of our education tools, it's honest and direct. I decided to share this clip so our blog readers could get a taste of what CAREEREALISM University is all about. We are a no-nonsense program. So, if you are looking for a pat on the back and for me to say things like '  you can do it  ' and '  it's not your fault'  - I'd skip watching. (But then, you read our site and know what we're about...which means you are all so much smarter than that!)  If you are brave enough to take 13 minutes out of your day to watch it, I promise you will be glad you did!  In this, I explain why: 1) ALL career roadblocks (past, present and future) start with YOU. 2) There are 2 main reasons why you are the cause of these roadblocks. 3) One of the reasons goes back to your childhood. 4) The other is a result of your selfishness. Wow! How's that for a punch between the eyes!?
