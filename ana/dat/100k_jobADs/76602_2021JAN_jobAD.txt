 Are you looking for a new role with a New Zealand founded drinks brand in London? 
 Tom Savano Cocktails launched in December 2019 and after a fantastic first year, are looking to start some serious growth this year. 
 Manufacturing premixed, luxury cocktails, we've already been the recipient of seven gold medals, two Great Taste awards and winner of the Spirits Business "Best New Product of 2020" Premixed cocktails have been the only alcoholic beverage category to grow in 2020, and not just grow - to smash it with 24% growth YoY. It is now almost the highest category by volume for the year as well, so is very much the future of the industry. 
 We have a very hands-on approach to the business and manufacture everything in house. We outsource almost nothing as we like to stay agile and able to respond to a fast paced marketplace. 
 The first hire we're looking to make in 2021 is for a production manager. This will be someone responsible for the production side of the business, from mixing, stock control, inventory management and ordering, supply chain, on-site paperwork and H&S. 
 You'll need to be comfortable with plenty of manual work as it is a very hands-on role, from carrying 25kg drums of gin, cleaning down large machinery, operating automatic labelling lines, loading and unloading pallets. You'll also need to have a keen eye for detail and a meticulous nature, to keep on top of inventory shortages, following SALSA level mixing and production procedures, good quality control standards and the work ethic to go above and beyond, to take extreme pride in every part of your work. This is a luxury product and needs a lot of attention to Quality Control and standards maintained. 
 Quality control points include: Ensuring every recipe is mixed exactly to spec, with all source ingredients within use by date and checked for any quality issues, storage and rotation with date labelling is adhered to, premises cleanliness is of A grade calibre at all times, inventory is catalogued and supply chain assured for up to a month in advance, bottling is done maintaining accurate fill levels with extremely low wastage and no spill onto the bottles, labelling machine is calibrated and labels go on perfectly straight, no bubbles, at the correct height etc. 
 We're looking for someone who is looking for a full time position for the foreseeable future, as being a small team we want to invest in people, not have turnover every six months. But this is a very exciting chance to be part of a promising startup with a huge future ahead of it, and to get in at the ground level. 
 As a person, we are looking for someone reliable, hard-working, dependable, honest and willing to do their part, whatever is required, to help the business grow. The work will be challenging and fast-paced, but a great change to be part of a growing team and move to a more senior role as the company grows. 
 If you are interested, please email us with your CV and a Cover Letter with as much background on why you feel the job would be a great fit, as possible.
