 Ep 026: Where job design meets technology 
 This time round, Richard and Pilar discuss some recent news coverage about how we manage our ‘digital wellbeing’ and screen time and discussions about the benefits of a shorter working week. 
 Do we really need a ‘mini phone’ to accompany our main phone? Do we need to spend less time in front of screens? And should we all be aiming for a four-day working week? 
 We turn a critical eye on these stories and consider the importance of evidence as well as job design and cultural norms when it comes to work-life boundaries and working hours. 
 Our shared challenge for next time is to review the Screentime function of your iPhone and share with us what kind of insight it’s giving you. Categories only - we don’t need to know how much time you’re spending on dating apps! 
 As ever, let us know what you think about the episode - questions, comments and feedback about the challenge. You can send us something pithy via Twitter at  @MyPocketPsych  or something longer via the comments form at  WorkLifePsych.com/contact
