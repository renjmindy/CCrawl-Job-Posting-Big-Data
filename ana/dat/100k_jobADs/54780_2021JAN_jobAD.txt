 The Economics Of Well Being, A Measure Of Success

 Click to read:   The Economics Of Well Being, A Measure Of Success 
 Source:   Harvard Business Review   (HBR) 
 Snippet:  Money isn’t everything. But for measuring national success, it has long been pretty much the only thing (other than, of course, sports). The specific metric that has prevailed since World War II is the dollar value of a country’s economic output, expressed first as gross national product, later as gross domestic product. This is an improvement over ranking by military victories […]

 Turning Toward Our Blind Spot: Seeing The Shadow 
 Posted on  September 5, 2020  by  akin Adeleye   Leave a comment 
   
 Click to read:   Turning Toward Our Blind Spot: Seeing The Shadow As A Source For Transformation 
 Source:   Presencing   Institute 
 Snippet:  We are living in a moment of tectonic shift in society. Something changed when we all watched the same images — 8 minutes and 46 seconds — the killing of George Floyd. During that unbearable experience, something broke down and broke open in our hearts, in how we relate to one another. And in how we want to live together. 
 From the Collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989. When the Berlin Wall collapsed in 1989, we witnessed the end of the 20th-century Cold War era. A wall collapsed between two conflicting social systems: capitalism and socialism. 
 Today we see a different type of wall collapsing. Not a wall between systems, but between system and self. A wall that has kept us separated from each other for too long. 
 While the coronavirus pandemic has functioned as an eye-opening disruption. Laying bare everything that is already broken in our social and economic systems. Black Lives Matter is shifting not only the way we see the world, but also the way we feel. How we sense each other’s well-being and pain. Whether we numb ourselves, or open ourselves to deeper human connection. Whether we turn away, or find the courage to change.

 Snippet:  In an era of heightened work-related angst, stress and pressure, there is an emerging movement to shorten the workday and week. Sanna Marin, the newly elected prime minister of Finland, is the most recent high-profile proponent of shortening the amount of time people work. 
 Marin said, “I believe people deserve to spend more time with their families, loved ones, hobbies and other aspects of life, such as culture. This could be the next step for us in working life.” The aspirational six hour four day workweek concept gained considerable attention throughout Finland, Europe and […]

 A Highly Productive Woman's Guide To Restful Work Nights

 Click to read:   A Highly Productive Woman's Guide To Restful Work Nights 
 Source:   Verily Mag 
 I was probably near the end of my high school career when my dad gave me the following insight about adult life: “You’re going to love the working life. Your job will be consuming during the day, but then you’ll be able to relax in the evenings, and what you’ll find is more time for your hobbies and leisure.” 
 When my burnout hit, I wouldn’t say I fell into leisure. It was more of a crash and burn scenario that included a lot of sleeping and mindless vegging out. So, as I started to regain energy, I found myself not sure how to stave off the old habits of checking into work after hours. But I knew that if that pattern continued, burnout would […]

 Snippet:  No organization wants to burn out its employees. And yet, according to new research, companies’ efforts to prevent prolonged stress among their staffs are falling short. Burnout happens when people aren’t given enough time to disconnect, rest, focus on other aspects of life and recharge. Unfortunately, nearly […]

 Welcome to Worklife Feed 
 Snippets:  When we consider whether we like our jobs, the actual work isn’t always - if ever - the first thing we focus on. There are so many factors and details that comprise our days. There’s our local barista when we pick up our morning coffee. There’s the commute where we listen to podcasts or music or just sit in silence in contrast to the chaos of children back home. 
 Many might find - and are finding - that the bones left of a job had been so well clothed pre-quarantine that they had never fully considered how much they did - or didn’t - enjoy the job itself. 
 Rather than get depressed about this realization, use it as an opportunity. You now have a chance to reignite your love affair with your job or figure out what you’d rather do. Both are upsides; you are being given insight that can improve your […].
