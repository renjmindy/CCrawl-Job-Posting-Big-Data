 New year new job? 
 02/01/2019BY: Tracey Mesken 
 ​New Year’s Eve is done and dusted and many of us are kicking off 2019 with fresh new year’s resolutions. But as we head into the year and our busy lives catch up to us, we often find it's just as easy to break new year’s resolutions as it is to make them. 
 ​ 
 A big goal for many people as they start a new year is a change of job; maybe you're feeling restless, you're just looking for a change of pace, or you want to go in a completely new direction. Whatever the reason, we have the resources to help. 
 Here’s some great tips on  writing a resume that stands out  and  nailing that all important interview , there's also plenty of other posts on our  blog  to point you in the right direction. Often preparation is the key to success, so making you have all these basics covered before you start applying can help you land the job you're looking for. 
 When it comes to applying for roles, you need to stay diligent. Make sure to check out job boards daily and set up job alerts so you never miss new positions. More popular roles often won’t stay open for long, so doing this will ensure that you're not missing out on important opportunities. WorkPac has 100's of positions available on our site, which you can view and apply for  here . To narrow down your results, you can also use our  advanced search , which lets you filter jobs by location and job type. You can also set up a job alert with us  here . 
 Touching base with a recruiter about the type of work you’re looking for is also a great way to get a bit of guidance. Don’t hide behind a keyboard! With over 40 Business Centres Australia wide we’re bound to have one recruiting in your area, so give us a ring on 1300 967 572 or find your closest business centre  here . 
 Most importantly, don't give up! Searching for a new job can be a long and often frustrating process, but the payoff when you land the role you're looking for is always worth it. So keep looking, keep applying, and stay focused on your goals for 2019.
