 I Lost My Job Today 
 Posted on  July 1, 2020  by  kristianw84 
 It's funny sometimes how we can pick up on vibes when something is telling us, something is just not quite right. When I woke up this morning, I had no idea the devastation that was going to hit me. 
 It's been 7 hours now and I've had some time to sit and think things through. I'm incredibly hurt and devastated, but I'm also extremely pissed off!! 
 I found out in May that my boss was resigning, I knew then that something just didn't feel right, but good for her for bettering herself! And knowing what I do now, I'm glad she's not there to be disrespected anymore. 
 About two weeks after that happened, the Vice President announced that my department was merging with the one next door. Well, that director already has a contract manager, which was what I was, so I asked what was going to happen to my position. I was told that they didn't know but assured me that I was still going to have a job and receive a very substantial raise along with it. They also informed me that all of this would be taking place on July 1st. So then I got to thinking, maybe they decided on this merge a long time ago. Things were just moving way too quickly for all of these so-called, well-thought-out, yet, last-minute decisions. 
 In the past couple of weeks, I have been pulled into meetings, given tasks to share the reports that I do, how I submit those reports, and grant information with the other contract manager and the director. I was told that this was so they had a better understanding of what I do so they could better support me. Well, now I know it was so everything would be completed before they laid me off. They laid me off. I've been there for 6 years, yet, they kept someone who was only hired 5 months ago!! 
 The vice president called me down to the conference room at 4:00 this afternoon. He informed me that they had to let me go because, during the reconstruction of the two departments, there was no position for me. I was given promises that I would have a job and be getting a raise just to have that all taken away! I am so angry right now. I was blindsided. I am so incredibly hurt, and I feel foolish for ever thinking they respected me. The vice president just kept saying it wasn't a performance issue and that he would gladly write me a letter of recommendation. I couldn't even look him in the eye. He kept saying he wanted to be here to support me, he asked me to let him help me pack up my things and carry them to my car, but I wouldn't let him. I was so short with him, but I didn't want to give him the satisfaction of seeing me cry. I put 6 years into that agency and I know I was in the process of looking for something better, but I was waiting until I could build a house, or go back to school, or move closer to family. Now I have no idea what direction I should take. I've been crying so much my eyes are swollen and burning. I am not in a good place mentally to make any kind of important decision right now. 
 I do know that I deserve better than that. I deserve to work for a company that actually appreciates the hard work, dedication, and time I give them! I deserve a company that recognizes my worth and potential, and I am going to take this time to find it. 
 I am going to use this time to research different jobs that I think I will excel in. I am going to see how many college credits I am away from my degree, I am going to write the hell out of my book and show every single upper management employee why they should have never let me go. 
 I am keeping an open mind to the lesson that this bump in the road is going to teach me, because while I am feeling completely lost and utterly devastated, and much like a failure right now, I know that's all this is, just a bump in the road. 
 Love & life lessons, 
 Kristian

 Yes! My brother told me that those cops who killed Rayshard Brooks were trained to kill and taught a taser was a deadly weapon. Very Sad! The training really does need to change.

 Sorry to hear that. Yeah you deserve better but life is funny, just not a 'haha' funny. I kind of feel the emotions here. What they did is not right, the truth hurts but lies are wrecking ball, you know what I mean. They shouldn't have done that build up thing. But when you said that it's just a bump in the road, it reminded me of how amazing you are, Kristian. I'm rooting for you!

 They are indeed. And what's pathetic is most people are caught up in other's avarice. Rejection often force us to see how the world works and it will push us to be better. But it shouldn't be for them. üòâ You got this, Kristian!

 I am so sorry! It's been shocking lately how management have been treating their staff in all countries. It's why I keep saying, stop sacking the workers, sack the management instead! It is managements fault why people keep getting sacked, sack the management! It's like those CEO's who keep cutting staff, who never, themselves, take a pay cut!

 We often forget, especially once we have developed what we think is a mutually supportive relationship with our employer, that every decision is based on money. Specifically how owners or share holders can get more. We are simply dollar signs to them. They are looking for us to make them the most money, while paying us the least to keep us doing it. Sometimes performance can change our title, our position, or even our salary, but we are always just another cog in the money printing machine. The way they led you on to insure your working knowledge would be passed on is simply despicable, and happens way too often. I am intrigued, as you have been sensing a disturbance in the "force" for quite some time, but couldn't put your finger on it. Well, now we know the vibes you may have been picking up on. I am sorry to hear that this happen to you. You deserve better! But I am glad you are trying to see this in a positive light. When one door closes, another opens. I hope this is the first step on a short journey to you finding employment that appreciates, recognizes, and rewards your selfless dedication to work. Till then, do what makes you happy. I am here in any way I can be and am sending you an extra huge dose of love! Stay strong! üíñüíùüíòüåπüíïüòòü•∞

 I'm sorry that happened to you. Thank you! Now that the dust has settled some. I'm going to fight for my rights, not saying I want my job back, I don't think I could work for them again, but I am demanding a bigger severance package since this came with no warning, and I demand to know why I, an employee of 6 years is being let go over an employee of 5 months!

 I'm so sorry. Good for you for demanding a better severance package. What happened was absolutely horrible, and you're in a good position to get a lawyer and pursue legal action if your demands aren't met. I'm glad you're doing okay, all things considered. Hugs!

 Sorry to read what happened to you. Don't forget that any company that lets you go is not the right fit! You are on the right path working on yourself, your own dreams and goals. Sounds like they made a bad decision and they will see that. Stay well!

 The economic and commercial world uses us and then drops us‚Ä¶.and it is heart breaking. Not because we are ambitious or demanding or self-important‚Ä¶but because we work hard, we go the extra mile, we make sacrifices, we put out heart into our work, we smile when we are tired, we build our life around our job‚Ä¶so when the big cheeses start looking at the bank balance, merging departments, reducing staff‚Ä¶it is going to hurt. 
 I am sure that you have lots of skills and experience, plus an amazing personality which will mean you will be an asset working with a new team. But right now‚Ä¶the hurt you feel over how they did this is natural. I feel so sad. When I read your post I was putting myself in your shoes and it made me feel very upset. 
 I used to work for an estate agents. Three men owned the agency. One wanted to retire and wanted to sell his share in the business. While this was going on, a rival agency put in an offer to buy them. Another of the three men wanted to sell his shares to cash in as well. The third man said he would buy out the other two, but he needed some time to get the money together (he would have needed big loans). Well‚Ä¶in the end, the other two went ahead and sold their shares to the rival company. 
They new agency came in and told all the staff not to worry, there would be no job losses, they were excited to work with everyone and would invest lots of money in their business. None of this happened. Half of the staff were made redundant. It caused a lot of upset. 
 Ironically‚Ä¶because I was the cleaner‚Ä¶I was safer than some of the managers. But I decided to quit when I found out what had happened. I thought it was a horrid situation and I did not want to work for the company who had clearly just seen an opportunity to make money.
