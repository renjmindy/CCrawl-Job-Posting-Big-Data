 What You Need To Know Before Starting A Voiceover Career

 As a performer, body language is absolutely one of your greatest tools to communicate with your audience, right? But what if you only had your voice to express a story? 
 Enter the major fears that come with a career in voice over.  **"How do I know if my voice is good enough?"  **  _  "Isn't it super competitive?"    "Where do I even begin?" _ 
 DON 'T PANIC!  I had to overcome the same fears and I'm ready to pass on  What You Need to Know Before Starting a Voiceover Career . 
 This week kicks off  Voiceover Camp  - a summer-long  #AskAnExpert  series with  Amy Russ  of  Actor-Webs . She, maybe like you, was curious about the transition I made from one form of acting to working in voiceover. Together, we break down  what you should expect  before starting a career in voice over, the  technique and training  that comes with the career, and the  big differences in auditioning for a voice over role as opposed to other auditioning opportunities . 
 SPOILER:  What I really wanted to express to Amy was how much voice over has completely changed the course of my acting career. If you approach it with the right mindset & training, it can be the most lucrative and fun branch of your acting career, too!! 
 So what do you think? 
Ready to dive into the world of voiceover?

 Because of your blog post, I was inspired to do the same thing! When I was a child, I always dream of working behind the camera of a very complicated industry called "news and entertainment". Being a voiceover came also in my mind since I felt like my voice fits the job too. I've been following Amy Ross in her programs and she is very efficient! She has mastered her craft, and I have been dreaming to be like her one day!
