 Job 28 
 1 Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it. 
 2 Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone. 
 3 He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death. 
 4 The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men. 
 5 As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire. 
 6 The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold. 
 7 There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen: 
 8 The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it. 
 9 He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots. 
 10 He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing. 
 11 He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light. 
 12 But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding? 
 13 Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living. 
 14 The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me. 
 15 It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof. 
 16 It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire. 
 17 The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold. 
 18 No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies. 
 19 The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold. 
 20 Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding? 
 21 Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air. 
 22 Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears. 
 23 God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof. 
 24 For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven; 
 25 To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure. 
 26 When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder: 
 27 Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out. 
 28 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.

 Job 32:1‭-‬2 KJV 
So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God. 
 Those who are righteous in their own eyes always feel justified in their opinions, no matter how much damage those opinions do to others. I remember a Facebook conversation I once read that proves this point. 
 A young lady was rejoicing because she had found some dickies (a type of neck scarf that covers the clavicle area under a shirt that doesn't button high enough to be modest) to buy online that she really liked. She was so excited because now she could modestly wear some of the clothes in her closet that she had been convicted about by the Holy Ghost as being too low-cut. To my surprise, an older woman began to condemn her for wanting to wear clothes that needed help to be modest. If she was truly wanting to be holy, she wouldn't come near a shirt that needed a dickie. 
 It still inflames me to think about it. I hope I never get so "holy" that I condemn a young convert who is doing their best to be sensitive to God because they don't live up to my standard. Similarly, Elihu was inflamed because (in his opinion) Job made himself more righteous than God. He felt he couldn't just sit by and let Job go unchallenged, because true righteousness always aligns us with God and never pits us against Him or His work in the hearts of men.

 Are we wise and have understanding or are we foolish and ignorant? Do you have the fear of the Lord in you or have you become comfortable and relaxed and don’t have the respect you once did? It’s always good to do a self check and make sure you have yourself right. Build and strengthen your altar and don’t let it collect dust. Be blessed today!

 Verses 23-28 MSG “God alone knows the way to Wisdom, he knows the exact place to find it. He knows where everything is on earth, he sees everything under heaven. 
After he commanded the winds to blow and measured out the waters, Arranged for the rain and set off explosions of thunder and lightning, He focused on Wisdom, made sure it was all set and tested and ready. Then he addressed the human race: ‘Here it is! Fear-of-the-Lord—that’s Wisdom, and Insight means shunning evil.’” 
 Proverbs 2:6-8 AMP "For the Lord gives [skillful and godly] wisdom; From His mouth come knowledge and understanding. He stores away sound wisdom for the righteous [those who are in right standing with Him]; He is a shield to those who walk in integrity [those of honorable character and moral courage], He guards the paths of justice; And He preserves the way of His saints (believers)."

 FIRST THE KINGDOM 
THE KINGDOM WAY 
 28 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding. 
 THE KINGDOM WAY is simple to begin. 
 1. FEAR the Lord JESUS and DEPART from evil. FEAR = Reverence, Follow and Obey JESUS = The WORD and SPIRIT of GOD. 
 2. DEPART = Stop, Turn away from, REPENT and Never do it again = Leave evil alone. Have nothing to do with any of it. No evil spirits, no evil thoughts, no evil attitudes, no evil actions. 
 Wisdom and Salvation are found through this simple beginning of and into The Kingdom of GOD.

 “But do people know where to find wisdom? Where can they find understanding? No one knows where to find it, for it is not found among the living. 
 “But do people know where to find wisdom? Where can they find understanding? It is hidden from the eyes of all humanity. Even the sharp-eyed birds in the sky cannot discover it. 
 He decided how hard the winds should blow and how much rain should fall. He made the laws for the rain and laid out a path for the lightning. Then he saw wisdom and evaluated it. He set it in place and examined it thoroughly. And this is what he says to all humanity: ‘The fear of the Lord is true wisdom; to forsake evil is real understanding.’”

 True wisdom? Oh my. A lot of humanity walks around with self proclaimed wisdom, but where does true wisdom come from? The FEAR of the LORD. How do we FEAR the LORD? If HE'S a loving God why should we FEAR HIM? 
 Hebrew: 
yirah: a fear 
Original Word: יִרְאָה 
Part of Speech: Noun Feminine

 So to deeply admire and respect the LORD…that's where true wisdom cones from. Thank You, Jesus!

 The fear of the lord is TRUE wisdom . It doesn't matter how many degrees you have or how much money you have you will never have true wisdom if you don't fear the lord.

 “Man puts his hand on [and tears apart] the flinty rock; He overturns the mountains at the base [looking for treasure]. He cuts out channels and passages among the rocks; And his eye sees every precious thing. Man dams up the streams from flowing [so that they do not trickle into the mine], And what is hidden he brings out to the light.” 
‭‭JOB‬ ‭28:9-11‬ ‭AMP‬‬ 
 This is all around us in and out of the church. 
There are people in this world that do nothing but chase position, pleasure, or treasure. They will do whatever it takes to get what they want. If it’s a job they would throw anyone under the bus or simply devote their whole life to it. If it’s pleasure it could be nothing but a mouthful of lies and if it’s treasurethen you’re looking at the root of it all and they will do absolutely anything to get that. Kill steal and destroy… 
when seeking first the Kingdom we must take those principles and apply them with positive placements in our lives. Like doing whatever it took to win a soul. Doing whatever it took to get someone to church, or to give them a bible study. Our goal should be “do whatever it takes to show them the love of God” you can’t out give God but you can definitely ask for his help as you seek ye first the kingdom and lead others to Christ. 
Take advantage of where your at in life if you’re a student or an employee with a secular job. There are people you’re working and going to school with that are backsliders..that are hurt…that have a true desire and hunger for God…pray for them. Pray for your boss or teachers. Then watch God move !

 There are so many things that we quote often all referring to the treasure in the heart. For where your treasure is there your heart will be also; Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh… etc while gold is very useful and the word of God says that it answereth all things it is wisdom and understanding that we must continue to seek because they are invaluable. Wisdom doesn't get old it just gets passed on, gold only do so much while wisdom can take care of any issue. Everyday we have lessons to learn from that can teach us lessons about wisdom.

 12But where can wisdom be found? 
Where does understanding dwell? 
13No mortal comprehends its worth; 
it cannot be found in the land of the living. 
 28And he said to the human race, 
“The fear of the Lord—that is wisdom, 
and to shun evil is understanding.”NIV 
 The question is asked more than once in this chapter: where can wisdom be found? And where does understanding dwell? And the answer comes and says that it can’t be found among the living. We find that we have an understanding of things in the flesh but when it comes to spiritual things and the eternal things that understanding can only come from God. We find that we must seek the Lord while he may be found and love be him with all our heart, mind, soul, and might. When we seek first the kingdom of God we begin to gain knowledge and wisdom by diving into deep prayer and diving deep into the word of God. We must set our priorities to God first and everything and everyone else second. 
 We have remember our ways are not his ways and our thoughts are not his thoughts. He alone can give knowledge to make it throughout our walk with him. We must have a fear of the Lord and a reverence for the things of God. No matter what we think we can accomplish on our on, we will never get as far as we can by having God in our side. If God be for us, then who can be against us. 
 I love the Kingdom!

 “But where can wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding? Man does not know the value of it; Nor is it found in the land of the living. The deep says, ‘It is not in me’; And the sea says, ‘It is not with me.’ It cannot be obtained for pure gold, Nor can silver be weighed as its price. It cannot be valued in [terms of] the gold of Ophir, In the precious onyx or beryl, or the sapphire. Gold and glass cannot equal wisdom, Nor can it be exchanged for articles of fine gold. No mention of coral and crystal can be made; For the possession of wisdom is even above [that of] rubies or pearls. 
JOB 28:12‭-‬18 AMP 
 https://bible.com/bible/1588/job.28.12-18.AMP 
 There is nothing in this world that can compare to the treasure of wisdom. Being wise in the ways of the Kingdom is a most precious commodity. It can't be bartered for; it can't be traded for earthly goods. I can't walk up to God and say, " I'll trade you some of my treasures for wisdom into your Kingdom." It just can't be done; wisdom is gained from studying the word and seeking out those that are like minded to learn and grow with. Why is it then a man will walk into a church; drop his riches and then expect to have knowledge of the word almost immediately. God doesn't operate that way. It does say seek ye first the Kingdom. I have heard of people giving with expectation and then going to the pastor and all of a sudden it's I did this and I did that; I know that for me it's not about and never has been about I give this and I've done that for the church. I know that I can't out give God. Wisdom is in getting to know God's word: it isn't in what can I throw in the face of the church because of how much I've given and haven't received what I expected. My riches are laid up in heaven; not on this rock. 
 But to man He said, ‘Behold, the reverential and worshipful fear of the Lord—that is wisdom; And to depart from evil is understanding.’ ”

 Precious wisdom 
 2 Chronicles 1: 
6 And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it. 
7 ¶ In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee. 
8 ¶ And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead. 
9 Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude. 
10 Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so great? 
11 ¶ And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king: 
12 Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like. 
 Wisdom is so precious because it is the application of knowledge. You can be the smartest person on the earth and not use wisdom. But wisdom sums up what God expects from our daily walk. We use the knowledge that we have and apply it in Christian living everyday. When we do that we will please God.

 AMP - 3 “Man puts an end to darkness [by bringing in a light], 
And to the farthest bounds he searches out 
The rock buried in gloom and deep shadow. 
 We are the light of the world, a city that is set on a hill that cannot be hid. Who am I bringing the light to? Who around me that is in darkness am I shining the light of Jesus Christ upon? 
 If no one, shame on me. We are not responsible for what they do with the light, we are just instructed to be the light. 
 Let my light Shine in the night time 
Let it shine all day through 
Let it shine Shine for Jesus 
Let it shine Shine on you 
 I was walking Alone in the darkness 
I didn't know Which way to go 
Then The Lord He turned the light on 
He changed my life Saved my soul 
 When I lived For just one purpose 
Let The Lord Shine through me 
But soon this love Can shine on others 
and His Spirit can set them free 
Just let my light Shine in the night time 
Let it shine all day through 
Let it shineShine for Jesus 
Let it shine Shine on you

 20 Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding? 
 27 Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out. 
 28 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding. 
 Man could live his entire life searching the mysteries of this world and still never attain wisdom. Wisdom does not come by the skill or effort of man, it comes by revelation from God. 
 This is because God already knows the beginning from the end. Things that bring confusion to us, He already knows the answer to. Things that cause us to worry, He already has worked out. 
 If true wisdom can be simply gained by human effort, then the fear of the Lord is not essential to obtaining wisdom. But if it comes from God's revelation, then right relationship with Him is the key to wisdom. 
 And since true wisdom does come from God, it is found by being in right relation to Him, and it is shown by a life that departs from evil.

 Yes, the fear (respect) of the Lord is wisdom and then there are the gifts of the Spirit, the word of wisdom and word of knowledge available when our own isn’t enough. Many times these gifts are needed but without the Spirit of God in us they are idle.

 Simple principle. At my work, the kids this week were learning different types of government. I won't go into detail but spiritually it made me think: what are we allowing to rule our lives and how? 
 Anarchy is a government with absolutely no rules or laws, in a sense, total freedom. There is no leader, everyone just does what they want. We may physically live in a society of democracy, but spiritually this world lives in anarchy. Society says, "YOLO" (You Only Live Once) attesting to the idea that everyone is his own person. "Do whatever you want man, it's your life. Do what makes YOU happy." But what about what makes God happy? What about what encourages and leads others to God, in turn bringing them an eternal joy? 
 It's time we stop being so selfish and start fearing the Lord. If we please Him and care for His Kingdom, He will surely bless us in return - you can never out give Him! Seek first the Kingdom, seek first the Will of God, seek first the wisdom of God, and He will mightily use you.

 Job 28 
Message 
23-28 “God alone knows the way to Wisdom, 
he knows the exact place to find it. 
He knows where everything is on earth, 
he sees everything under heaven. 
After he commanded the winds to blow 
and measured out the waters, 
Arranged for the rain 
and set off explosions of thunder and lightning, 
He focused on Wisdom, 
made sure it was all set and tested and ready. 
Then he addressed the human race: ‘Here it is! 
Fear-of-the-Lord—that’s Wisdom, 
and Insight means shunning evil.’” 
 Proverbs 9:10 
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding. 
 Proverbs 1:7 says, “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction.” 
 Wise man built his house upon the rock . The foolish upon the sand. Whose house stood when the storms came ? We all know the answer it was the wise man. Fearing God is not about being afraid but knowing His power. Respecting knowing Him. 
Understanding the Word His ways . If we build on The Rock ,as Job when life was blowing like a vicious storm his faith in God with stood the test of time 
 Keeping ourself before Him knowing wisdom only comes from God. Knowledge comes from study but true wisdom is knowing God in all His glory . 
 When the reality of God’s true nature has caused us to fall down in worship, we are then in the right position to gain wisdom. Wisdom is merely seeing life from God’s perspective and responding accordingly. Wisdom is a priority, and we are told to seek it above all else . 
Yes the fear of the Lord is the beginning not the end but the beginning of wisdom ………..

 “People know how to tear apart flinty rocks and overturn the roots of mountains. They cut tunnels in the rocks and uncover precious stones. They dam up the trickling streams and bring to light the hidden treasures. “But do people know where to find wisdom? Where can they find understanding?” 
‭‭Job‬ ‭28:9-12‬ ‭NLT‬‬ 
 Wow, this first really tells the story of how bad people want precious material but who do not search for wisdom. Wisdom is more valuable than all these precious stones and gold and silver. We need to turn our heart towards God and seek his kingdom first.

 12 “But do people know where to find wisdom? Where can they find understanding? 
 Childcare was one of the hardest jobs I've ever had to work, why? Children lack certain wisdom and some understanding. They constantly do things that would make you question their humanity. Surely, as we've grown we understand that throwing a tantrum due to not receiving a certain item is not wise. And correcting can only go so far, there has to be a foundation of expected behavior. Specifically, if we desire for the little humans to grow and mature into a successful part of society. 
 They needed to know where to find understanding and build critical thinking skills to form wisdom. At a certain point, you have to look at the instructor, are we providing the information, are we setting the expectations clear? 
 Through Job 28 we read how they knew how to do all these other things, but lacked the skill to find wisdom. How devasting it will be to teach the next generation, all the skills of this world, and cripple them in the Kingdom of God. 
 Just as we teach our children to walk and talk, we should be teaching them how to pray and read. The fundamentals of a relationship with Christ.

 God freely gives us wisdom and understanding. But many choose to not have it because they are comfortable with their life. I had a friend who told me blatantly do not speak to them about God that they want no part of it. They has a great life that they’re comfortable with but Satan doesn’t mess with someone he already has. It makes me sad how many people reject God because they have a comfortable life. God gives us so many chances and so much grace and mercy. We just have to receive it.

 Job explained how hard it was to find wisdom, and then asked the logical question. Job knew that he needed this precious wisdom, and he certainly knew that his friends needed this wisdom. 
He seems to say that, though men should explore the deep places of the earth with all the diligence of miners seeking gold and silver, though they should exert all their mental force, as miners use all their muscular vigor, and though they should employ all the machinery within their reach, as men do who pierce through the rocks in search of precious treasure yet it is not within the range of human labor and skill to attain unto wisdom. That can only be found by another and a higher method; it must come to us by revelation from God, for we cannot find it by our own efforts. 
 God as the Source of wisdom, We must look to God for wisdom. We may share in it only through a knowledge of the revealed mind of God.

 But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding? Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living. 
Job 28:12‭-‬13 KJV 
Solomon knew where to find wisdom since God gave it to him as a gift and he knew how valuable it is. 
For the Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding. 
Proverbs 2:6 
For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it. 
Proverbs 8:11 KJV 
Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding. 
Proverbs 4:7 KJV 
At the end of the chapter Job declares the beginning of true wisdom which fears God because there are a lot of wise people in this world BUT it will do them absolutely no good at all at the judgement seat of God!!!

 Job 28:20,23,28 
 
 
 Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding? 
 
 
 GOD understandeth the way thereof, and HE knoweth the place thereof. 
 
 
 And unto man HE said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding. 
 
 
 Who should question the Lord God? No one! He set the boundaries: fear Him and depart from evil.

 Job 28:28, "And unto man he said, "Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom: and to depart from evil is understanding." 
 Proverbs 3:13, "Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth 
understanding. 
 True Happiness only comes from Knowing God! 
There is a true Happiness and Joy in a person who truly fears (reverences - deep respect, high regard, admiration, appreciation, etc…) God, and who departs from his evil ways, knowing he is released from the chains of sin that have had him bound. 
 Thank You JESUS for giving us the Wisdom to fear YOU, and for the Understanding to depart from our evil ways, and for True Happiness and Joy in YOU!

 12 But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding? 
 Through our this chapter I saw this question and answered it with G O D. This answer is correct but it goes a little deeper you have to have a fear of the Lord meaning a deep deep LOVE for the King of Kings you can be friends with someone but if you don’t love them they won’t really truly open up to you and give you understanding of what they are going through and who they are. You can scratch the surface with God but until you Love him you’ll only have that surface. But I’m looking for something more I need the details and truth I need to be corrected by God and his righteousness. I need the Love of God.

 “God alone knows the way to Wisdom, he knows the exact place to find it. He knows where everything is on earth, he sees everything under heaven. After he commanded the winds to blow and measured out the waters, Arranged for the rain and set off explosions of thunder and lightning, He focused on Wisdom, made sure it was all set and tested and ready. Then he addressed the human race: ‘Here it is! Fear-of-the-Lord—that’s Wisdom, and Insight means shunning evil.’” 
Job 28:23‭-‬28 MSG

 The smart thing to do is to fear the lord. When we have that respect for him and honor it, he will honor us.

 From this chapter what came to me was that God made everything. God can also control everything that he made. But the good thing is that God gives us choices. We can make the good or bad choices. I hope that we follow the good choices that he created in the Bible. BE OBEDIENT! POFW!!!😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁

13 Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living. 
 Godly wisdom and understanding cannot be bought and we will never know the value here on earth. Wisdom and understanding will cause us to excel in this life but also the life to come. Just as words cannot explain how awesome God is they cannot truly explain the value of the wisdom He gives us.

 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding. 
 If only everyone in the world knew of, and followed this "key point" of wisdom. How much better our world would be. God would hear from "The Heavens" and heal our land. 2nd chronicles 7:14 
if Job said it, and these very words are also quoted in "the Wisdom Chapter" of Proverbs, and continuously throughout the bible. One should take heed! and work out there own salvation with fear and trembling- Philippians 2:12 
Because the same God who made the body and soul, is the same God who has the power to destroy both body and soul. People go around calling good evil, and evil good in this day and age. I think at times we all have to ask God to search our hearts, and remove from us what's not right within us. I always want to keep… The Fear Of The Lord with me, and ask before thinking or speaking "What Would Jesus Do"? 
Sometimes when we let our emotions get to us, it is of evil… If it's not thinking of good for others. I have fell in this boat a few times, but I always repent, and ask The Lord to help me change my view with a humble heart. Because the flesh is weak but the spirit is willing. Because To Fear The Lord Is To Respect His Word & Do Good And Think Good Towards Others.

 “And this is what he says to all humanity: ‘The fear of the Lord is true wisdom; to forsake evil is real understanding.’”” 
‭‭Job‬ ‭28:28‬ ‭NLT‬‬ 
 Seek God First! He will give you wisdom and understanding. “If you are wise and understand God’s ways, prove it by living an honorable life, doing good works with the humility that comes from wisdom. But if you are bitterly jealous and there is selfish ambition in your heart, don’t cover up the truth with boasting and lying. For jealousy and selfishness are not God’s kind of wisdom. Such things are earthly, unspiritual, and demonic. For wherever there is jealousy and selfish ambition, there you will find disorder and evil of every kind. But the wisdom from above is first of all pure. It is also peace loving, gentle at all times, and willing to yield to others. It is full of mercy and the fruit of good deeds. It shows no favoritism and is always sincere. And those who are peacemakers will plant seeds of peace and reap a harvest of righteousness.” 
‭‭James‬ ‭3:13-18‬ ‭NLT‬‬ 
 “Fear of the Lord is the foundation of true wisdom. All who obey his commandments will grow in wisdom. Praise him forever!” 
‭‭Psalms‬ ‭111:10‬ ‭NLT‬‬

 Fear the Lord and depart from evil. Those are key principles to live by. That is true wisdom and understanding. Out of all the knowledge that man may attain the wise thing to do is know God. In in is life and life more abundantly.

 7 He also knew that Jacob had obeyed his parents and gone to Paddan-aram. 
 Yes, obey your parents no matter your age. Honor your parents by obeying them. Be kind and gentle during times of disagreements.
