 “All I wanted was to live a life where I could be me, and be okay with that. I had no need for material possessions, money or even close friends with me on my journey. I never understood people very well anyway, and they never seemed to understand me very well either. All I wanted was my art and the chance to be the creator of my own world, my own reality. I wanted the open road and new beginnings every day.” ― Charlotte Eriksson

 I reach out and cradle his face in my hands, my thumbs resting below his eyes, catching his tears. “Me too, Jax, me too.” He rests his forehead on my shoulder and wraps his arms around me tightly. My arms squeeze around his neck and I feel him start to shake. We stay like that for awhile, crying together, grieving together, trying to find solace.

 “I just witnessed my best friend get murdered and survived two gunshots! If I feel like getting drunk I am going too.” I snap. They were right though, I never drank. It wasn’t my thing but hours ago we laid Juliet to rest and I realized that her murderer could have been watching us, or me rather, for awhile. Call me crazy but that was a hard pill to swallow.

 I Can Officially Say I Survived a Hurricane 
 October 10, 2016  /  @labriejames  /  1 Comment 
 Well, Hurricane Matthew is officially in Charleston's history. Ours too.  It's interesting to me as some one who grew up in the mountains her whole life to have lived through a hurricane. I was raised in Montana, the land of below zero and frozen air, but I never once had a snow day. But here …  Continue reading I Can Officially Say I Survived a Hurricane

 This will be a quick post but my phone is blowing up from all the worried texts. Yes, I live in South Carolina where the hurricane may or may not hit.
