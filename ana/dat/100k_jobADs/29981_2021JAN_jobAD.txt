 SNAPLICATION, the future of your job applications? 
 Snapchat. Anyone who is anybody is on it now. With  over 166 million  daily users on this social media platform, who would pass down the opportunity to advertise themselves? McDonald‚Äôs took it a step further as they launched Snaplication. The  Snaplication  campaign (Snapchat-application) was launched in June and pushed the boundary of job applications in order to reach Generation-Z.

 McDonald‚Äôs initiated this worldwide; including Australia. In the USA alone offered over  250,000 jobs  through Snaplication. The idea became McDonald‚Äôs largest recruitment channel.  Snaplication  is a 10 second application of why the person wants to work at McDonalds. The snap also included a lens/filter of a McDonald‚Äôs crew hat and name badge which might also served as digital marketing by being sent around to friends. This campaign has driven in a huge amount of attention since, with Snapchat, news media, and word of mouth.

 Personally, I believe that this campaign will not continue long-term. However, I consider this as a great digital marketing strategy as they invoked the interest and engaged with the young target through utilising a new and stimulating perspective. In the future, this could be an effective use of social media such as Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook for other businesses to reach and connect with the new generations to come. 
 Do you think this is an effective digital marketing strategy and would you be willing to accept this as the future of job applications?

 I think this is a really cool topic! It was definitely a strategy that really captured a lot of attention for McDonalds and emphasised how much it was a youthful, fun place to work. 
I don't think it will be a viable job application channel for the long term though - especially not for other companies who are maybe a bit more serious and put more emphasis on past experience and education compared to merely a 10 second snapchat first-impression. 
I don't think I would like to see it as the future of job applications either - not sure how great it is to focus entirely on appearances to get through the initial stage of the application. Surely discrimination would be an issue here?

 Hi! Thanks for the comment, I agree with a lot of what you're saying. Thanks for bringing up the point of discrimination, I believe McDonald's focus was on what the individual shares within those 10 second; hoping that individuals would share the most important information within that time, however that could truly lead to not sharing enough about oneself and experiences and also lead to discrimination and superficial selecting. This could potentially lead to hiring of inadequate individuals and cause a bad media response too. This is why I believe rather than a viable recruitment service, it was a digital marketing strategy to connect with the youth.

 Hi there, 
 This is a really creative marketing strategy, particularly targeting at Generation Z. As they are all about adopting the innovative ideas, this Snaplication is definitely up their lane! 
McDonald has certainly drawn the attention of Generation Z for sure! 
 In fact, maybe LinkedIn could partner up with Snapchat to create a 10-second video that is permanently on their profile? 
 I read up more on this Snaplication and it mentions it would become part of their hiring process rather than replacing the traditional face-to-face interview. But I couldn't help but keep thinking about Emma's comment - about how discrimination would become an issue. This is certainly something all digital marketers need to care for. 
 Great post! üôÇ

 Hi Melbourne marketer, 
I love the LinkedIn idea however I believe at that point, it may be more appropriate to have a video that is a bit longer where individuals can share more about themselves rather than 10 second videos. 
I do think that it is a great marketing strategy for younger generations like Generation Z and may be used by other companies. 
 Thanks for your response!
