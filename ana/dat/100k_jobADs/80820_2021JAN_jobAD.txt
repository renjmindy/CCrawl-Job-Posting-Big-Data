 Slowing Down 
   
 I made a new year’s resolution for the first time in years: Slow down. I am rarely without a to-do list, and feel ill at ease unless everything on that list is done or in the process of getting done. “Relaxing” in the evenings is acceptable, as long as it’s done after Piopio is put Continue reading "Slowing Down"

 Future Letter to Myself: 2018 
   
 It’s the end of the year, which means it’s time for New Year’s Resolutions. As I have for the last few years, I’m writing a future letter to myself — a different take on resolutions and goals for 2018. What is a future letter to oneself? As I wrote in 2013: That’s the thing about New Year’s resolutions — Continue reading "Future Letter to Myself: 2018"

 Halfway to a Graduate Degree 
   
 As of today I'm officially halfway to a graduate degree. I've successfully completed five courses toward an M.S. in Communication from Purdue University. I also just passed the nine-month mark in my current job. I won't say it it hasn't been a stressful first several months at post.

 One Down, Nine to Go 
   
 I've successfully completed the first (of 10) courses toward an M.S. in Communication from Purdue. I'm not going to lie: Time management has been a challenge -- less because of the burden of school work and more because of the demands of my job.

 Tomorrow is the first day of school for kids across the U.S., but I started classes two weeks ago. I'm officially a graduate student at Purdue University. If all goes well, in 20 months I'll have a Master of Science in Communication.

We were glad to get our Continue reading "Thinking About Jordan"
