 FreelanceWorkExchange.com is a great site I recommend for those looking to "work in their pajamas" as thousands of current job postings of legitimate job offers are listed (ie looking for writers, programmers, data entry personnel) and not MLM business opportunities. 
Plus their site offers helpful tips/advice, such as: 
FREE report: 'How to Find Freelance Work' 
FREE course: 'The Secrets of Work at Home Success' 
FREE eBook: 'Start Freelancing for Profit Today' 
Check it out! Here's wishing you much success!
