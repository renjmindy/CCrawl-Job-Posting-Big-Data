 DIGITAL DESIGN ENGINEER  ,  Haystack Observatory  , to work on the development of advanced radar and radio-astronomy data acquisition and signal-processing equipment. Will be responsible for working with scientists to translate high-level requirements into working hardware, including end to end efforts to design systems, translate the concepts into working hardware, and use the resulting systems in the field. The projects include a new low-frequency antenna array, advanced phased array radar hardware, digital back-ends for very-long-baseline interferometry, and spectral-line processors for the Haystack 37-m radio telescope. The work within those projects involves FPGA design and development of digital receivers, filters, spectrometers, and correlators, with data rates approaching terabits per second (Tb/s). May also be responsible for helping with requirements definition and validation and the cost and time planning for new projects. Technical and scientific tasks may also be possible consistent with the background and experience of the individual hired. 
 Job Requirements 
 REQUIRED  : M.S. in electrical engineering or a related field; at least three years of significant hands-on technical experience in system and FPGA signal-processing design using VHDL, Verilog, and Xilinx design tools (especially for Xilinx Virtex series); and knowledge of digital-signal processing techniques and algorithms.  PREFERRED  : experience with Altera chips and design flows; experience designing printed circuit boards using FPGA hardware operating at multi-gigabits per second (Gb/s) data rates; and experience with C/C++, Python, and MATLAB programming in a Linux environment. **Job #18361 
 ** Occasional travel will be required.
