 Impossible job interview questions — #MILLENNIALLIFECRISIS 
 Posted on  September 23, 2019  by  Wichita Genealogist 
 
 
 The following is not word for word, it’s just how I remember a piece of my interview happening this morning. I don’t think that I have, ever in my life, experienced job interview questions so difficult as I had this morning. Interviewer: So Vee (my full name was used), I’m going to give you hypothetical […] 
 
 via  Impossible job interview questions — #MILLENNIALLIFECRISIS . 
 Trimmed my comment down as it became a lot longer answer than I originally anticipated. I included the most likely answer some interviewers want to hear below. 
 I created a separate post to address some of what was in this post initially. 
 First thing, call 911 or whatever the local emergency system is for the area. Next, I would assess the situation - are any cars leaking gas, downed power lines, or other things that could put me at risk for serious injury or death. Next I would assess everybody, including the pinned adult, to see if I could tell which one was worse. Granted, in many cases, you may not be able to tell, but in other cases, asking some simple and fast questions, checking the ears for possible fluid that indicates serious head injury, etc. will give you enough information. I have some basic first aid, plus some  CERT  training. In some cases, it's obvious that one is going to die (black toe tag for those who know what that means) no matter what. I am not a fan of these kinds of questions unless you are applying for a job where you would be dealing with these situations. I might even go so far as to say "Thank you for your time, but this has nothing to do with the job and does little for you to help access my critical thinking ability." Might even ask where I can send the bill for wasting my time if the interviewer goes over the line. 
 It sounds like the expected answer should be help the child first or you are a heartless person who they don't want to hire. You also have to access your risk in helping each person. If one person is in a situation where you are placing your life in danger by helping, and the other person is not, then you help the one who is less likely to get you injured or killed. That's one of the first things I was taught in  CERT  training. 
 There are plenty of critical thinking questions an interview can ask that involve the duties of your potential new job that are relevant, and should be the ones they are asking instead of this question.

 Are you a paramedic or a first responder?

 No, I am not; I am CERT trained, but that's about close to first responder as I would be which isn't that close. I used to be first aid/CPR certified by the Red Cross and the American Heart Association, but that's been a while back. 
 I am not a fan of these kinds of questions unless they directly relate to the job you are applying for, but realize many employers think they show critical thinking, or lack thereof. For many of these questions can be found online along with suggested responses. I couldn't find this question online in a quick search, but depending on the nature of the job you applied for, they probably have an expected answer they want to hear. Every once in a while, you can give them an answer they weren't expecting that can boost your rating with the interviewer. 
 One thing CERT training has done is show me some things that affect the level of care. For example, with some injuries, the person gets a black toe tag. That means the person is dead and doesn't know it yet, or they are so far gone, they are a low priority. A few of those may make it, but the goal of triage is to access those who are the highest priority that stand a good chance of being saved, followed by those who are less severe, followed by those who need some help, but can wait longer.
