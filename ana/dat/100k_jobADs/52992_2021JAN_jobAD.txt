 Build a protocol that brings formal verification to the blockchain 
 Role overview 
 This small, early-stage, funded Cryptocurrency project is using  OCaml  to make sure the technology behind Cryptocurrency is ready for global, commercial use. This is an opportunity for Functional Engineers to help Cryptocurrency live up to the hype. üöÄ 
 Cryptocurrency is a domain where correctness really counts. üë©‚Äçüíªüí± As such, a cornerstone of our approach is a focus on building reliable software through the use of statically-typed functional programming languages. This is reflected in our  OCaml  codebase and style of structuring code around DSLs, as well as in the design of the smart-contracts platform we're developing. 
 There is  no need to have prior experience in cryptography  , and we're hiring engineers to work on a bunch of exciting projects including: 
 
 Our  OCaml  DSL for writing  zk-SNARKs  (a cryptographic primitive for certified computation). 
 The design of a virtual machine and higher-level languages for smart contracts (there a lot of interesting challenges here since the  VM  has to be efficient inside  SNARKs ). 
 Working on the core networking, cryptography, and reliability aspects of the protocol. 
 
 This is a chance to join a small, collaborative team and have a ton of independence while working on fascinating cross-disciplinary problems in computing. We also offer competitive compensation both in salary and equity as well as top-of-the-market benefits. 
 Looking for: 
 
 functional programming 
 programming language theory 
 security 
 distributed systems 
 cryptography 
 cryptocurrency 
 
 There are no hard requirements and we're more interested in learning about your individual background.
