 Census 2013 So What Did You Think? 
 Posted on  March 5, 2013  by  Luigi Cappel 
 Our household did it online and I have to say it was a smooth and easy process. The questions we didn't have to answer were grayed out and we were all done and dusted in no time. Hopefully this means that finally we can hold referendums and vote online in future. 
 However, to me it was a major missed opportunity to learn more about who  Kiwis  are, what they do and where. This seemed to be to be simply a modern version of the feudal system where nobility tried to establish how much tax they could claim from their citizens. I love the Census system, always used to use copies of the books the Statistics Department used to put out and have been a keen user of the tables and tool builders on the website over more recent years. This  Big Data  has a huge impact on where to do business, where to build shops and factories, schools etc and the potential to not require costly double ups of data collection as will remain necessary for many Government organisations. 
 Here are a few thoughts from me of things that I would have liked to know and would have been easy to include and a few comments on what was included: 
 Ethnicity. For a country that is so multi-ethnic there were only 8 ethnicities offered and one of them was  New Zealand European . That effectively makes it a  political question  and one that does not allow qualitative or quantitative research. As anyone who has studied statistics knows, most European Caucasians will select the first option, leaving us with skewed data. How about culture. I know people who will register as Chinese because they look like their ancestors, but were born and raised in New Zealand and in most things they do other than appearance are indistinguishable from any other NZ born person. On the other hand there are people who totally live the culture of their family and do not integrate much with our everyday society. 
 The question on what languages you can have a conversation in, was easy for people who really don't speak English, to say they do. This to me is important because we know there are now large numbers of people who will struggle to answer a question like "where is the nearest dairy?" in English. 
 What is your religion? This to me is very old school. You either belong to a sect or you have no religion. What if you are agnostic, spiritual but don't belong to a particular church? This would effectively assume that if you have no religion, you do not believe in a higher spirit, God if you will. 
 I would have liked to know what people's jobs are. As a futurist, I'm aware that many of today's roles or job titles didn't exist 20 years ago and it would be very interesting to be able to identify shifts in trends in employment. Yes, this information is available to IRD, but I want to know these answers and you could argue the same about the table which asks about personal annual income. 
 The employment questions also didn't support all options. For example, I am a founder in a couple of start-ups. I am not an employee and I do not draw any money from the companies. I work very long hours in them. But I couldn't answer the how many hours do you work in your job, because I'm not employed by the companies. These are not family businesses or family farms, although we do have a project creating virtual pets. Because I don't have a 'job' all the options below these questions were grayed out. I was left with the questions of did I apply for a job and if so, how. BTW I also do not get any sort of benefit from the Government. 
 The only questions on health focused on disabilities that stop you from earning money or require a benefit. Wouldn't it have been interesting to get more information on conditions such as asthma, diabetes, ADHD, Autism, Cancer etc. where people continue to work or study. Not so much from a single point in time but from a trend perspective. Tie this into geospatial mesh blocks and area units and some very interesting information might have emerged. What about depression and mental health? If we were able to see statistics based on location, what discoveries might that lead to? Perhaps ones that Government doesn't want to reveal? 
 They asked how many cars were available to the household, not how old they were, how often they were used, how big the engines were, whether they were NZ new? Yes, again I know this information is collected by other Government agencies, but it is not made available to the public and business in the same way. 
 Question 32 would have appealed to teachers. In the last 7 days did you work for pay, profit or income for an hour or more. Novopay anyone? How many people worked but haven't been paid? Many have waited much more than a week, I've heard of people who still have pay overdue for months! (No I am not a teacher). 
 What else would I like to know? 
 
 Do you have a land-line (that has dial tone)? Because in the event of power outages like earthquakes, they often still work. 
 Do you have a broadband connection?  VOIP ? 
 How many computers do you have at home that can access the internet? 
 How many mobiles do you have in the household that are connected? How many of those are Smartphones? 
 How many hours a week do you spend: Playing Sport or other outdoor activities? In club or organised activities? Watching TV? Playing computer games? On social media? 
 Do you BYOD to work and use it for work purposes? 
 How often do you buy fast food or eat out? 
 What about savings? What do people do with their money? Are they part of a super scheme like Kiwi Saver? Do they buy stocks (Mighty River Power would like to know)? What was the last big purchase in the last 12 months? 
 How about leisure, do they go away for a holiday? In NZ or overseas? Can they afford one at all? How long for? 
 
 There are many more questions that could have been asked like, how easy was it to complete this online? Would you be happy to vote in the next elections online? 
 So in summing up, its great to finally have a Census again and I'm looking forward to finding out what has changed in New Zealand, particularly as a result of the Canterbury earthquakes, but also information like how many NZ born people have left the country permanently, what is the make up of this country today compared to the last Census. 
 Congratulations on what appeared to be a smooth online operation, but what a missed opportunity to get some more learning. I think there has been so much focus on finally getting the job done, that there was insufficient focus on getting some highly important and valuable new data. The world has changed so much in 5 years. It appears like Novopay, that not much else has when it comes to taking advantage of 21st Century technology.
