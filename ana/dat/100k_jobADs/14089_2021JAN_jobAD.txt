 What's My Real Job? 
 What's my real job? I am in the soul-growing business. As we all should be. -Elizabeth Gilbert. 
 Hey guys! How are you all? I'm in Nashville, Tennessee. Yes, I can't believe it either. I wish I could write more but I'm tired and jet-lagged and I want to spend as much time as I can with my beautiful hosts. So, here are some photos: 
 Radnor Lake. 
 Calories count. Check then choose. 
Left-overs from  Frothy Monkey  plus some fruit, and a quick guacamole from me

 Can't wait to share more with you! It is so hot here! I can't believe it! Even warmer and sunnier than the south of France!

 Wow, you're in North America, I can't believe it! Are you planning on coming to Canada? Toronto is such a top notch city (always high on many different lists of best cities in the world to live)!
