 Hans Zimmer - Live on Tour 
 Posted on  April 15, 2016  by   Christine Lucas

 I first realised the music of  Hans Zimmer  in  The Lion King  (1994), the soundtrack earned him his Oscar! I didn't care much for the songs of Elton John but the orchestrated pieces were breathtaking. He managed to convey all the emotions in the film; love, terror, heartbreak and joy. Listening to  Stampede  , if you close your eyes you can imagine the buffaloes bearing down on Simba. 
 Over the years, I have accumulated many of his soundtracks. Fan based videos on YouTube are a great source to go to, as well as Wikipedia and Amazon. I could list all of his soundtracks, but I won't. You can read more  here . 
 Biography search results suggest that during his early career, as well as writing themes for BBC TV shows, (  Going for Gold  being one of them), he produced and featured briefly in the video of  The Buggles's  number one hit single,  Video Killed the Radio Star  (1979) which was a theme from my early childhood. So even though I was not aware of Hans Zimmer as a composer, his music contributed to the soundtrack of my 80's. 
 In 2001 he received great acclaim for his soundtrack to  Gladiator . I was a little slow on the uptake but since then most of my free time has been filled with the music of Hans Zimmer. For me, he seems to be the go to composer whether you want to be energised as in the rollicking tracks of  Inception  or to have a good cry, the music from  The Dark Knight Rises  seems to hit a particular cord with me. 
 No other living composers music has had such a profound effect on me as does Hans Zimmer's. So imagine my excitement when his  Live on Tour   was advertised last year! For many years, it has been a dream of mine to see the music of Hans Zimmer being performed by a live orchestra, but for the man himself to be performing on stage also is something I never comprehended. 
 In London two years ago Hans Zimmer did 'trial' arena shows because he didn't believe 'anybody would actually show up'. I was tempted to go but the cost, not just of the tickets but of travelling and accommodation put me off. So last year on the day tickets were released I eagerly snapped up a couple for the Birmingham date. It may have cost a small fortune but to have a dream come true, it was worth it! A month later I was reeling as they released a new date in Manchester, but that is by the by. Birmingham it would be! 
 April 12th 2016:  Being my nosy, inquisitive self I already knew what to expect come the day of the concert. I was looking forward to  One Day  from  Pirates of the Caribbean  and  The Dark Knight  medley. 
 The  Barclaycard Arena  was relatively easy to get to by car but due to certain roads being closed in major roadworks we left with plenty of time. Inside we were subjected to bags being searched and the boys being frisked! Once finally past security, I bought my programme which was £10, in London it had been £15! Then went in search for our uncomfy seats. 
 We sat in eager suspense for 40 minutes, then the lights in the arena dimmed and an excited hush murmured from the crowd. Hans Zimmer, his guests and a 70 piece orchestra took to the stage just after 8pm, even though there were still a lot of empty spaces in the audience. People were still being shown to their seats while the choir sang  160BPM  from  Angels and Demons  , which irked me somewhat. I took some pictures but they weren't very good. I wish I had taken my camcorder but didn't know whether photography was allowed. 
 What I like about Hans Zimmer is that he collaborates with (and mentors) people from diverse musical backgrounds and this concert was no different. It felt more like an ensemble production rather than a one man show. 
 The first set went too fast! I almost blinked and missed it! It was wonderful to hear so many favourite themes. We were entertained by  Gladiator  , Czarina Russell sung it so beautifully.  The Lion King  performed by Lebo M made everyone teary and  Tina Guo  flicked her hair as much as she did the bow across her cello for the  Pirates of the Caribbean  medley. The sound was impeccable, not ear tingling as in some concerts, and the lighting was inventful, in the second half of the show it became more akin to a rock concert! 
 There was a 20 minute interval. We went to stretch our legs before the darker second set began, which was filled with superheroes, inhuman guitar riffs and drums that reverberated through your body. 
 Even though at times there was a lot of bombast, the quieter moments where Hans Zimmer talked anecdotally about his career were more intimate, even in a big arena space. 
 The Dark Knight  medley did not disappoint. I sat through it tapping my feet and grinning, much like the Joker. I felt bereft when  Interstellar  pipped up. I knew that the show was drawing to a close. As the final triumphant bars of  Stay  vibrated around the arena, Hans Zimmer stood conducting from the front. The note faded and he took a bow as everyone in the audience stood to their feet. Some of us stayed standing knowing that he would come back onto the stage for an encore. I was surprised that quite a few people left before he came back to perform the medley from  Inception . 'Fools,' I thought as  Mombasa  lit up the stage like a rave. The night ended with  Time . If there was a piece of music that was written to describe the human condition, then  Time  would be it! Heart-achingly painful and yet so brief. The night ended on the wave of Hans Zimmer's hand and the audience standing to its feet once again. 
 There are moments in life when I wish I could push the rewind button and relive the experience again and again. This concert was exactly like that, if I had a fairy godmother I would suggest Manchester! :p However I will just have to make do with watching the videos I took and others like them on YouTube. I hope you enjoy the concert compilation I have mixed below and any feedback is appreciated. 
 In the future, I look forward to Hans Zimmer's next installment for the Ron Howard film, Dan Brown's  Inferno . I wonder if it will be just as good as his  Da Vinci Code  soundtrack? 
 I will end the post with Hans Zimmer's own words taken from the concert programme. I found them very profound. 
 ' Concerts are in real time…I get to be…part of you; and you be a part of me. Only in this very moment does this exist. We're lucky, in these tumultuous and violent times, to have art and music to lean upon and unite us. At this very moment it is at its most essential. It breaks through the boundaries…and just allows us to be people united in common enjoyment and pleasure for a few precious hours. My hope is that tonight my music speaks to you personally, wherever you are in your unique story.'
