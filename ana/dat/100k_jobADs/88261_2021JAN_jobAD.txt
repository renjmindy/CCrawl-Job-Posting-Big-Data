  5 Jobs To Keep You At The Beach  
 Anica Oaks 
 January 09, 2014 
 Just get back from vacation on some tropical island? Well, welcome back to the cold! You love the seashore, and cannot imagine living anywhere else. If you are concerned that the necessity of earning a livelihood will mean leaving the ocean behind, you'll be happy to know there are careers tailor-made for beach lovers. Here are some of the best five beach jobs: 
 
 1. Scuba Diving Instructor 
 If you love the water as much as you do the beach, this career may be ideal. Instructors teach both recreational divers and those wishing to become certified. Work venues include cruise ships, resorts, and dive centers. You may be required to operate boats, maintain equipment, and talk about marine life. It is essential that instructors be in optimum health and top physical condition and receive certification from an agency. Also know that risk will be your constant companion in this occupation. 
 2. Ocean Engineer 
 Oceanographers and others who study marine environments and animals rely on state-of-the-art equipment to do their jobs effectively. Instruments must perform well and stand up to corrosive salt water, high-volume use, and all types of weather. In light of rapidly developing technologies, this is a career with a future. Coastal engineering, one aspect of the profession, addresses concerns like pollution and the effects on the marine ecosystem associated with coastal development. Some ocean engineers have also been developing ocean-cleaning gyres in order to remove plastic from the seas, which shows how you can use this career to advance conservation technologies. 
 3. Underwater Filmmaker 
 If you have a way with a camera, are patient and not easily ruffled, and feel at home beneath the waves, consider a career in underwater photography. Basic requisites include both scuba and free diving ability, knowledge of marine environments, understanding of the changes in color as you dive deeper (and how to adjust for lack of light and altered hues at greater depths), and proper equipment. 
 4. Marine Biologist 
 Practitioners of this profession are dedicated to studying marine mammals, fish, and ecosystems. Such study has the goal of determining risks to and protecting seaside and underwater environments.  Marine biology colleges  train students to join the ranks of those at the forefront of improving the quality of these ecosystems, preventing or reversing loss of habitat, maintaining health of sea creatures, and more. Marine biologists work in a variety of locations, including rehabilitation centers and government and private agencies. 
 5. Tour Boat Pilot 
 Those cruise vessels that ply up and down the seacoast are a major attraction for tourists and seasonal residents. Locals also find these ships desirable locations for special events and a relaxing way to spend an hour or two or three. Pilots often double as tour guides, so if you enjoy operating a ship while sharing your affinity for the coast and everything in it, this is an ideal occupation. Whether you own your own vessel or work for a company, you are required to pass a licensing exam and have knowledge of vessel components and safety regulations. Now that you’ve been introduced to five seashore careers, all that is necessary is to decide which one is right for you. Whatever your choice, you’ll be literally mixing business with pleasure.
