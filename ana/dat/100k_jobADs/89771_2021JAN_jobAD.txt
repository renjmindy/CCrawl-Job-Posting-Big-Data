 About this project 
 engineering-manufacturing / others-3 
 USD 50 - 100 
 I am doing an university study of Primary Reformer, and now I need a help to design this equipment. 
First, I need to know if you could do this: 
- list types of reformers (for primary reformer) 
- compare those (we should select the best option) 
- find the calculation method to design it (define number of tubes, thickness, length of each tube, etc) 
- design it (draw it in 3D) 
(Material of the equipment/part of it, weld and connections. Can you define as well?) 
 At the first moment, I'm looking for someone to list reformers and compare it until Monday. Are you available? What's your budget?
