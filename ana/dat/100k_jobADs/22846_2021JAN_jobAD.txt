 market your product and Post jobs (www.electronicpakistan.com) 
 http://www.electronicPakistan.com  provide a huge upsurge in sales, and a significant decrease in expenses, thus making it a clever and astute business move. A website: 
 
 Acts as an inexpensive showroom, storefront and salesperson to your local market and beyond — 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
 Serves to satisfy the phenomenon of customers increasingly researching purchases before buying, thus leading to an informed customer who is ready to buy. 
 Allows for mailing lists to send the same email message to hundreds of customers for the same cost as sending to one. No more huge postal costs, or licking envelopes. 
 Can provide answers to frequently asked questions, which reduces the costs of staff having to answer the same thing over and over. 
 Provides a shopping experience that is both convenient and timesaving. (And for women, satisfying!) 
 Gives your business a great advantage over your competitors and consequently provides an opportunity to capture their market share. 
 Doesn’t limit a business to its location; you can reach a wider and more diversified market. 
 Makes it easy to collect and collate information on the purchasing patterns of your customers, thereby allowing a vendor to cost effectively alter their sales and promotion methods. 
 Can accept automated orders and payments for products. 
 Can facilitate an online database of products, which is quick and easy to modify; whereas traditional media catalogues cannot be altered without great expense.
