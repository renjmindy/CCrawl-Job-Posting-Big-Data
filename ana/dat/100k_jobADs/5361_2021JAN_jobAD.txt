 How to Stand Out During the Job Search 
 January 8, 2021 
 Laura Paredes 
 The process of hunting for career opportunities can be a draining routine for any job seeker. Interviewing is stressful, but you have to get noticed from the pile of resumes first before your journey really begins. Whether you are interested in Workiva or another company, here are some suggestions to incorporate in your career search to increase your visibility during your job search. 
 Research the company 
 To avoid getting caught in the loop of mindlessly applying to positions, first seek to understand which company cultures align with your personal values. 
 
 Highlight any relevant experiences in your resume and determine how they align to those company values. By doing this, you can focus your experience on your resume and how it relates to the job you are applying for. 
 Highlight results and quantify them – Achieved X by doing Y as measured by Z. Hiring managers like to see your accomplishments rather than the typical responsibilities. This helps them piece together your potential fit and not just the title and duties of your last position. 
 
 Be creative with your credentials 
 Find ways to be creative with documents such as your cover letter, recommendations and online portfolios of work that will help you stand out from other applicants. 
 
 Now that you have an interview... 
 Did you lock in an interview? Great! Now it’s time to really go above and beyond. 
 
 When it comes to being in direct competition with others, it is not enough to just have a good interview. Making a personal connection can set you apart from other applicants. 
 Come prepared for your meeting. Showcase yourself in an authentic way, not just on a piece of paper. 
 Time to put that research to work. Use the research you’ve gathered and prepare for ways to highlight your experience based on what the job is asking for. 
 Know your resume from beginning to end. Many hiring managers will derive their questions from that content. 
 Try to enjoy yourself – Be genuine. Make a connection. 
 Ask questions! 
 
 
 Following up Post-Interview 
 Send a thank you note to each person with whom you interviewed. This personalized approach not only shows your level of interest but it allows you to reiterate your fit and showcase skills that are important to the role. You want to reinforce things like: 
 
 Communication – The phrase “strong written and verbal communication skills” is on almost every job description ever created. This is your time to shine! 
 Active listening – Reflect back on the conversation and highlight relevant things said in the interview. 
 If you don’t have your interviewer’s email or office mailing address, you can get it from the receptionist on the way out. 
 
 Maintaining visibility in a pool of applicants is undeniably difficult. These strategies won’t guarantee you the job, but they can help you open more doors. Getting noticed involves some effort and creativity on your part, but deploy these strategies and you may find yourself on the elusive short list.
