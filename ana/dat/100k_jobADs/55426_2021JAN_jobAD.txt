 A New Relationship is Like a New Job 
 When you apply for a new job with a company, you usually go to the company website to checkout where they are located, the dress code and read reviews on the company. You want to make sure this is a place you want to work at, and you will fit in with the culture of the company. You do your research before applying for the job because if it’s not right for you, you don’t apply. You know from your research this is not a place you want to spend everyday going to because it’s not a good fit for you. 
 If you do feel you can fit in you apply for the job, get the phone call and go through the interviewing process with your resume and a face to face interview. Once you are hired there is usually a ninety-day probationary period for the employer to see if you are a good fit and it gives you the opportunity to see if they are a good fit for you. When you are hired by any company it is based on your resume and your interview. Which you can write anything down on your resume and say anything in your interview. How the employer knows what you say on paper on your resume and verbally in your interview is true by your actions on the job. 
 Well…it’s the same process when you start a new relationship. Each person can say anything to each other about who they are and how they live, and you don’t know if it’s true until you see their actions. When starting a new relationship, you should handle it just like starting a new job. Do not believe everything they say about who they are… wait and see who they are. Actions do not lie and no matter what they say when you first start talking to each other you need to see for yourself if it’s true. Have them on a ninety-day probationary period just like companies do to see if you are the right fit for them and if not, they let you go. You should do the same thing with someone who you enter a relationship with, if they are not the right fit for you…let them go. Take your time when starting a relationship with someone and do your research just like you would do when you start a new job. 
 So, my question is…why do we do research on a company when we want to work for them, but not do research on a person we want in our lives?
