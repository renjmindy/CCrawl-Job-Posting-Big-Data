 [Contract] Craft CMS Front End Developer REMOTECONTRACT 
 Job Description 
 £300-400 / day - Remote 
 3-6 month contract (extensions likely to be available) 
 Who we are looking for 
 We’re seeking an experienced contract / freelance Front End Web Developer to join our tight-knit agency team, and help us produce high quality, conversion and UX optimised websites for our varied range of interesting clients. 
 You’ll be part of our remote cross-functional agency team that includes designers, copywriters and data analysts, and will be responsible for modern, best practice front end development. 
 Our agency is a small but mighty web design and conversion optimisation studio. Rather than mindlessly churning out code, we work on a consultative, proactive basis, which our clients really value. We’ve been careful to pick clients who appreciate the quality of our work, and our friendly, professional insights. 
 While we don’t expect you to be a fully fledged designer, you must be up to speed with UX principles and have a keen eye for good design, as there won't always be final designs provided when you're working on tweaks to existing sites. 
 You'll be responsible for... 
 
 
 Building  complete  website front ends based on both your UX and design ability and in collaboration with visual designs/wireframes 
 
 
 Making  improvements  to existing sites, based on guideline briefs and using your own design ability to implement an attractive and usable solution 
 
 
 Developing well-functioning websites, with a focus on page speed optimisation and browser/device compatibility 
 
 
 Setting up CMS packages including intuitive and flexible content model design 
 
 
 Troubleshooting, debug and upgrade/maintain your code 
 
 
 Launching websites and ongoing website maintenance 
 
 
 Producing technical documentation and accurate effort estimates for prospective projects 
 
 
 Adding creative flair to front end templates, over and above any static designs that may be available 
 
 
 On occasion, helping to set up and run User Testing and A/B tests using JavaScript tools 
 
 
 You must have... 
 
 
 Proven recent experience as a Front End Web Developer delivering the responsibilities as outlined 
 
 
 CMS and cloud platform experience, Craft CMS and ideally Shopify 
 
 
 Extensive understanding of core languages: JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3 
 
 
 Experience with modern front-end frameworks such as Tailwind, jQuery, SCSS 
 
 
 A solid grasp of build tools and package managers (Laravel Mix, Webpack, Node, Composer) 
 
 
 Comfortable working with and setting up Git-based push-to-deploy systems (we use DeployHQ with Server Pilot managed DigitalOcean droplets) 
 
 
 Ability to faithfully extract designs from design tools such as Sketch and Figma 
 
 
 UX skills and a good eye for design 
 
 
 Organisational skills and time management to meet deadlines and raise problems at the right time 
 
 
 A setup that enables you to work well remotely 
 
 
 References we can take up 
 
 
 How to Apply 
 Please apply using the link below, along with a description of your work on your last three project descriptions, plus a covering note detailing why you feel you'd be a good fit for this position. 
 It also wouldn't hurt to tell us why you like Craft CMS compared to some other, let's say, "popular" options.
