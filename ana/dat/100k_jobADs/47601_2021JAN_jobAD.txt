 Haircuts, Mushrooms, Baby Birds and a New Job 
 Posted on  May 28, 2017  by  ignitedmoth 
 I feel like it's been too long since I last posted, but I am super sleepy, so this is just gonna be a random update post full of Blah Blah Blahs. 
 Blah #1:  I finally decided it was time for a change when it came to my long hair and I went and got 10 inches of it chopped off. It's the shortest I've ever had it before, and I love it! ❤ I went to a beauty school and got it done by a student which was kind of scary, but she did a great job though and I'm absolutely loving it. 🙂 
 Blah #2:  I got to try morel mushrooms for the first time just recently. They might not be much to look at, but once they're cooked they're delicious! 
 Morel mushrooms: hideous to look at, tasty to nom. 
 Blah #3:  There's a nest with a couple little baby robins in it out back. I got to see them today while the mama robin was out and about. I kept a good distance so as not to disturb them but it was really cool to finally get to see the little guys. 🙂 
 Blah #4:  I'm in the works of getting a new job! I'm pretty excited about it. Part of me is nervous since I'm always a little nervous about change, but I'm really looking forward to it and I know it will be a good thing. 🙂 It even has the hours I was really hoping for. 
 That's it for the blah blah blahs right about now. I can barely keep my eyes open at the moment, so it's off to bed for me and Bailey. 
 Bailey, the beast that dwells beneath the blankets. Disturb her slumber at your own peril.

 So where's the pic of the new hairdo? I always preferred long hair on girls until Ruby Rose, have you heard of her? Then I met my wife who looks like Ruby Rose and had short hair when I met her. It's long now but still lovely. Rockin Robin was one of the first songs I learnt to sing. I've eaten some pretty err "whacky" mushrooms before but none that looked like that!! Congrats on the job love. I've just chucked my own job in to start my own business GULP. I'm excited but it's a big change. Now get some damn sleep!!!

 Haha, you're right, I'll have to post some pics soon! 
Yeah, Ruby Rose is gorgeous. Your wife must be a stunner too from the sounds of it! 🙂 I've always really liked short hair but I have naturally curly hair so it just seemed like it wouldn't work well for me. I have an amazing flat iron now that gets it really straight though, so I figured it was time to get really adventurous! 😛 
And thank you so much for the congrats on the job! I'm really excited about it. 😀 Wow, that's awesome about you starting your own business!! How exciting. 🙂 Best of luck to you with it. That's really cool. Congrats!

 I like the quick bullet point approach. Might need to try it myself, if I ever get something important to say 🙂

 Yeah, I've already faced a very hot and muggy day here and was pretty happy not to have the extra 10 inches of hair to deal with. lol

 That makes two of us who've had our hair chopped off recently then, it's very refreshing isn't it? Would love to see a pic of the new 'do! Interesting about the mushrooms as I'd never even heard of those before… x

 Yesss, it's so much nicer! 🙂 Especially when I'm washing it and only need a small amount of product compared to before. lol 
I think we'll both be loving the short hair experience this summer as it keeps getting hotter and hotter out there. 
Yeah, I'll definitely have to post pics of the new cut soon!

 We had some baby robins in our yard as well but unfortunately, there was a huge storm and the five we saw hatch ended up being blown about and we found just two huddled under a tree. We scooped them up, put them in a shallow box back in the tree, and kept our fingers crossed their parents would find them and all would be well. For whatever reason, the parents never came back and after 12 hours of hearing the babies squeak sadly for Mom, we brought them in, gave them a warm place to sleep, a good drink of water, and drove them to the rescue the next morning. I was sorry to see them go, but glad to know that out of the original 5, at least 2 made it. Fingers crossed yours are better protected from the elements than ours were.

 Aww, I'm so glad you knew exactly what to do and took all the right actions to help those little robins. 
There's only two in this nest and they seem to be doing really well, thankfully. The mom seems to have picked a really safe and secure spot for them and she's always right near by. 🙂

 Good luck on the new job! It's always a little nerve wreaking when you are starting a new venture. I'm sure you're going to have a fantastic time! I'm happy you have the hours you wnat. Personally, I start my new schedule tomorrow where I will be getting off at 7pm versus 10:15pm… Definitely an upgrade but I prefer opening shifts lol.

 Thank you!! ❤ Yeah, I agree, opening shifts are so nice because you get out earlier and don't feel like you're just waiting to go to work with the time you have off that day. lol Congrats on your shift change. That'll be so nice! 🙂

 Aw, thank you so much!! ❤ Yeah, I got a little nervous here and there, but she did a good job. It didn't turn out exactly like the photo I took in but I'm still really loving what she did. 🙂 She'd never done that sort of haircut before so I was in there for a good while. About 3 hours. lol And the job is going well so far, thanks!! 😀
