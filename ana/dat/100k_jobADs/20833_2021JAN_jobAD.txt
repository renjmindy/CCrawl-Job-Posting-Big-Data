  Struggling To Find A Job After School? Attend Work It Daily's New Grad Job Search Summit!  
 Jenna Arcand 
 December 02, 2020 
 As a recent college graduate (or student who will be graduating soon) you are fighting an uphill battle to find your first "real" job post-college. The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically affected the job market, giving you fewer opportunities and leaving you to deal with higher competition. 
 We know the odds are stacked against you. We understand the struggles that you're facing. That's why we're offering a new job search summit specifically geared towards recent college graduates—to help you overcome these struggles and successfully begin your career. 
 
 Join Work It Daily's founder and CEO, J.T. O'Donnell, and head career coach, Ariella Coombs on Tuesday, December 8th, 10am-4:30pm EST and learn everything you need to know about finding a job after college, for just $10   ! 
 The truth is, college taught you everything EXCEPT how to get a job. 
 Job hunting has changed a lot in the last 10 years, and schools don't teach their students the proper way to find work in the current job market. If you don't know the right way to find a job, you're going to be wasting your efforts for months before you realize that what you're doing is not working. 
 So, all you recent and soon-to-be college graduates, it's okay if your job search feels overwhelming. You don't have to go it along. With this online job search summit, you'll learn the right strategies and gain the tools you need to land a job fast, despite whatever challenges you're facing. 
 Now is the time for you to get the education you need to improve the effectiveness of your job search. Nobody is going to do it for you. The good news is, it's not rocket science. All you need are the right tools and teachers. And at Work It Daily, we have both, all at an affordable price.
