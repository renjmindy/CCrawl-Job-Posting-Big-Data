 Market is still going strong ! 
 ﻿ 
 
 Re/Max Sells - #1 Pickering 
 ﻿ Its been a long day… just in but happy to say my Buyers are thrilled to have purchased their dream home tonight in Pickering.  First day on the market and we moved on it and it paid off !   Listing agent was a true professional and negotiations were fair and everyone walked away smiling.  Thats real estate !  If it is done right, everyone walks away happy !! 
 Welcome to Pickering, Olga and Lou… you will love raising your family here. 
 Not only do I feel good about tonight's sale, I have made friends for life.  Real estate is about relationships.  It is about building trust and working together.   Next time you are thinking of moving, make sure the Realtor you work with is someone you feel comfortable with.  WE are on the same side. 
 Ok well I am signing off now, going to get some much needed sleep and back at the grind in the morning ! 
Night night !
