 Idaho Fish and Game Deputy Director Moore pegged to agency's top job 
 March 31, 2011 -- Ken Cole 
 Virgil Moore isn't the candidate whom the anti-wolf crowd wanted to have directing the IDFG. I hope he does a good job but only time will tell. There are a lot of pressures on the IDFG to be very heavy handed with wolves if they get management authority. 
 He's been with the IDFG for a long time.

 Interesting that they stayed "in house" in making this selection. A big challenge? Overcoming the shrinking pool of license buyers and the resulting smaller pool of budget dollars. How to overcome that? Give all Idaho citizens a seat at the table through, for example, a conservation tax (e.g., one-eighth of one cent of sales tax).
