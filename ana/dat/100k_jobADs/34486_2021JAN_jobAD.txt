 This is a super opportunity to support a large multinational as they acquire a new division and integrate it into their main business. The role will be high profile, working for the UK CFO and will also require liaison with internal and external partners including finance, outsourced providers and consulting groups. As an Accounting Associate you will have responsibility for the operational finance activities including tax and statutory accounts. Part of the role involves solving challenges with the ERP system ensuring synergy between the acquired business and internal processes. 
 The successful candidate will ideally have a practice background or significant compliance experience gained from a similar business. Knowledge of reporting under US GAAP and/or IFRS would be useful, alongside experience of working within a matrix structure. Finally, the ability to communicate (verbal and written) complex concepts to finance and non-finance individuals, both internally and externally is essential. 
 Rarely do I see this type of role become available and as such it is an excellent opportunity to make a significant impact on a large business. It is also a great chance to build value in a cv to enable future progression.
