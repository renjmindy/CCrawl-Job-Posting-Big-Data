 Posted on  October 6, 2011  by   John 
 So yesterday October fifth Steve Jobs has passed away. Though I don't have a lot of Apple technology I know all the impact that Steve Jobs has had on the world. My only piece of Apple technology is my apple nano ipod. Even though I don't own that much apple technology I know that Steve Jobs help revolution the computer and helped the world progress a lot. Even though he didn't invent the computer or the internet he did create new ways and methods that eventually became the phenomena know as apple. From start beginnings at his father's garage to multi-billion dollar cooperation Steve Jobs is truly an amazing person.
