 Workers Need a Career Narrative to progress 
 Posted on  April 4, 2013  by  shelleyupton 
 This article from Harvard Business review suggests that younger workers need to be able express clearly where they want to go in their future work world, but I'd argue that you need it throughout you working life. 
 If you can explain clearly and simply where your interests lie and what your ambitions are, you're in a far better position to be remembered as the 'face that might fit the task' whaen new opportunities come up. The original article's certainly worth a read: Younger Workers Need a Career Narrative -  http://pulse.me/s/ixdWw
