 May's article: "Mid-life Crisis? Check out these careers" 
 5/1/2013 
  0 Comments  
 Carly read an article on Yahoo called "Mid-life crisis? Check out these careers." 
 Article: http://education.yahoo.net/articles/career_change_options.htm?kid=1MN8K 
 Carly's comments: 
 1. It is interesting to find that if you already have a Bachelor's degree, you can just obtain a certificate in paralegal studies, vs. an Associate's degree in paralegal studies if you do not have a degree. 
 2. Career #6 "Computer Support Specialist" I remember doing help desk (also, what we called it) when I was obtaining my Associate's degree in Web Design.
