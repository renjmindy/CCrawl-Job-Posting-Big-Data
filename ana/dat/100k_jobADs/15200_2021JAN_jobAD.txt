 My Night Job’s monster hunt now also available for PlayStation 4 
 My Night Job takes players right back to the 80s and 90s: The splendid 2D arcade game lures you in with its horror story and action-packed monster hunt. 
 Tuesday, May 17, 2016 -- My Night Job is an action arcade game which offers a very special job: inspired by monster movies of the 80s and 90s, My Night Job's hero Reggie Venkman fights monsters and rescues survivors in true old-school-2D-sidescroller manner. The turbulent monster hunt is now available for PlayStation 4 in North America and South America and will be released in Europe on May 20th. 
 ** My Night Job  offers Reggie and his sidekicks hours of action and fun ** 
 Every player who dares to accept this job offer, receives the order to rescue 100 survivors out of 25 scenarios in an old mansion and escort them to a helicopter. Evil monsters that conquered the mansion want to prevent the hero's success. Players don't just use their bare fists to fulfill their mission: The old mansion provides 63 wapons which help Reggie. The hero turns just about anything into a weapon as long as it isn't nailed down: When push comes to shove, even an umbrella or a refrigerator will do! When it gets tough, players can even use an axe or various firearms. The longer you play, the higher the level of difficulty, which guarantees prolonged gaming fun. At least as long as Reggie can keep up with the growing challenge. A round of  My Night Job  is won when all 100 survivors are safe or Reggie bites the dust. Heads up: If the monsters manage to take over more than three rooms, your hunt will also be terminated. 
 Turbulent monster hunt in popular 80s and 90s style 
 My Night Job  pays tribute to 80s and 90s horror movies and games. The hand-drawn setting was inspired by 80s and 90s horror movies. Due to a charming pixel look, the game practically breathes the gloomy atmosphere of the monster hunt. Tenderly staged and animated enthrallingly,  My Night Job  is a real eye-catcher which will also persuade your friends. Thanks to its high degree of detail,  My Night Job  invites you to extensively explore the setting and hunt the monsters down. Attentive players will continuously find new allusions to genre classics from the 80s and 90s. 
 The repeatedly awarded 2D arcade game is now also available for PlayStation 4 
 My Night Job  has already received awards and honors ahead of the release for Windows on April 21th 2016. At Game Connection America 2015,  My Night Job  was a finalist for "Best Desktop Game". At the BIG Festival 2015, the sidescroller was "BIG Starter" finalist. Furthermore,  My Night Job  won the "Programa de Produçao de Projetos Audiovisuais" at the Secretaria Municipal de Cultura de Sao Paulo in 2014.  My Night Job  was created by the Brazilian developer team Webcore Games. 
 My Night Job  has already been released for Windows. Starting today,  My Nigth Job  is also available for $7,99 for PlayStation 4 in North and South America and will be released in Europe on May 20. Save now: Celebrating the start of Reggie's monster hunt, PlayStation 4 Plus members as well as LATAM consumers are offered a discount of 20% on the game during the first two weeks.
