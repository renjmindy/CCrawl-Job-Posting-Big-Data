 Phone Interview in Review 
 OK, this post is two days in the making. I'm still having trouble with focus. 
 
 This isn't the school, it's actually a picture of Victoria College in Toronto, but I thought the image would brighten up my post for today.

 Yesterday: 
 Hot off the pressesâ€¦ I just had a telephone interview for a teaching job (a long distance away). I think it went well. I'm still processing it all. At least I went in prepared with what I was going to say although I got a few curve balls. I think I did pretty well. I can't think of anything major that I screwed up. We will see how it goes. Now I wait to hear word back from them, but I should know something within the next couple of weeks. My references fell a little short, i.e. some of them didn't make it, so I have to followup on those. 
 I wish I was more organized! I can't keep things in my head straight. ðŸ˜¦ I think I am slightly hypomanic. I need to get focused. The school is actually hiring for three positions, so if I got one, I could be starting as early as August! 
 Today: 
 I've had a some time to process the interview. I still feel confident about the interview, although I probably could have handled a couple of things better than I did. I'm trying to figure out how to send a thank you note since the entire committee wasn't there and also because I missed the name of one of the committee members. I could send one directly to the chair and ask him to pass along my thanks. That's about the best I can think of. If anyone else has any ideas, please share! ðŸ™‚ 
 I started on the higher dose of Geodon last night, and already I feel my hypomania fading away. It appears that I react very well to antipsychotics. Either that or it's just a new episode, this time of stability. Wait, scratch that - I'm distracted today. Maybe it's ADD. During this post (today) so far, I've talked with DH, checked facebook, mail, and texted. 
 I'm trying not to think of the "what ifs" - what if I get this job? How will we move? DH is committed to the fall semester here so that means time apart. We've done it before, but we really don't do well apart. And we'd have to sell the house, which we may have to do anyway, so we better get cleaning. We have so much junk to sort through! But how to clean when you keep getting distracted? 
 I am getting a head of myself. There's no guarantee that I will even get this job. I'd like to ask if you, dear reader, would please cross your fingers, think good thoughts, or say a prayer for me. I need to get out of the rut that I am in and I think that getting this job would do that for me. Thanks!
