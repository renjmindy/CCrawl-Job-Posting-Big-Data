 I frequently tell people that work-at-home jobs are like traditional jobs; you need skills and experience to get them. The suggestion that a work-at-home jobs are similar to traditional jobs is true, but like in the traditional world, you don't always need a fancy education or tons of experience. What you do need is the ability to to the job and a great resume to impress an employer. 
 If you want a work-at-home job, but are struggling to find work that you can do, here are a few you can consider. Please note that because these jobs don't require a lot of skill or education, they may not pay as well. However, working at home can save you money and even come with tax perks, so you may not need as much income as you need working outside the home. 
 Customer Service  - Customer service agents take orders, make reservations and solve problems. While some customer service jobs require experience in customer service, many are looking for people who have pleasant demeanor and can work with the public. Customer service reps get paid anywhere from $9 to $15 per hour, sometimes a little more. Check out  this video and list of customer services companies  to learn more. 
 Microwork  - The growth of the Internet has allowed many people to create their own business. But wearing all hats can be a challenge, so many have turned to micorwork and freelance sites to hire people to take care of some of the tasks that need to be done. The projects are often quick and short in duration, so you need to do many tasks to make enough money to live on. The tasks can include making a phone call, copying information off a receipt or other item, rating something, social media comments and more. Some tasks can be done by your mobile phone, such as taking a picture of an item. Other tasks might require a little more skill such as editing a photo or writing an email.

 Online Juror  - Similar to how companies survey consumers to get feedback, attorneys use mock online jurors to get a sense of how their case will play out. Just like in real juries, attorneys seek specific types of people to be jurors, so you'll need to provide a lot of information about yourself to get matched to a mock trial. There are several online jury resources, including  eJury.com ,  JuryTest.com , and  OnlineVerdict.com . You can expect to get paid anywhere from $5 to $50 per trial. 
 Transcription  - While transcription doesn't require specific education or experience, it usually requires a quick and accurate typing speed that you have to prove through a test. There are a variety of transcription types including medical and legal (both of which require education and experience), and general or business transcription. An example of a transcription job might be to transcribe an audio podcast for a podcaster or a live event for a speaker. Other skills and equipment you'll need are a good command of the language and possibly audio playback controls. You can learn more about  transcription work, including several places that hire transcriptionists here . 
 Web Search Evaluator  - A web search evaluator works to give feedback on how well search engines are delivering search results. Sometimes these jobs have other names, for example, Google calls it "ads quality rater". There is a high number of these jobs available for people who are bilingual. These jobs require that you are comfortable with the Internet and know a little bit about culture, but you don't necessarily have to have a background in search evaluation. Some places to check for web search evaluator jobs include  Appen ,  Google  (search "Ad Quality Rater"),  LeapForce , and  Lionbridge . 
 Website Usability Testing  - This may sound highly technical, but if you can get online, search a website and provide feedback on what works and what doesn't, then you might want to consider being a website usability tester. You maybe requires to have video and audio recording equipment to apply for work and conduct tests. Pay is usually $5 to $10 per test, which sounds great, except you'll probably only get a few tests a week, so it's best for people looking for extra cash on the side. Some places to check for website usability testing include  StartUpLift.com ,  Userlytics , and  UserTesting.com
