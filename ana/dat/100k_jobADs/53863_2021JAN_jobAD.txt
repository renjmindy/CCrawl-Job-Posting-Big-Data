 The upper jaw is spongy bone, also known as cancellous bone or trabecular bone. It has large air spaces. 
 The lower jaw consists of cancellous bone with a thin outer layer of compact bone. 
 The real determinant of the amount of pain and length of time to heal after an extraction is the size of the tooth and the difficulty of the surgery.
