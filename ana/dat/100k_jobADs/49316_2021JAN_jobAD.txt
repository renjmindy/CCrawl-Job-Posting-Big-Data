 This £300+M TO Group with extensive multi-site UK operations is made up of many different operational divisions and has had an extensive period of growth throughout 2020, despite the economic climate and has a large order book and growth plan for 2021. 
 Due to the expansion overall and the growth potential of one of their key business units they now wish to appoint an experienced and capable General Manager to lead this multi-site business unit through the upcoming growth and development over the coming years and offers outstanding opportunity for the GM to progress within the wider group in the future. 
 The organisation is extremely profitable and has huge cash reserves to invest into all of the divisions moving forward into 2021 and has still been investing throughout 2020 despite tough trading conditions across the UK and so the opportunity for the General Manager to affect change and grow the business has never been more apparent. 
 Reporting directly to the group CEO and with full divisional P&L responsibility the General Manager will lead all aspects of this multi-site manufacturing and distribution operation and be the driving force of change and growth. With a strong team across the two sites and an ever expanding market place for their innovative process and product, the future is bright for this organisation and so this is a genuine career development opportunity for the motivated and driven individual who is seeking a long term career prospect with C-Suite potential. 
 The ideal candidate will be a proven General Manager / Operations Director / Managing Director and will come from a high volume and fast paced manufacturing and engineering operation with a complex supply chain where commercial strategy and attention to detail and market trends is paramount. 
 You will be a leader of people, a driver of change and growth and someone who is creative with ideas and their approach to process improvement and supply chain development and who can see past what is there to what could be there. An ability and previous experience of leading a multi-million turnover business and reporting into a larger group structure at C-Suite level would be advantageous as influencing at all levels will be paramount to the success of this position. 
 The role offers a market leading remuneration package including a strong base, car allowance and bonus based on business and personal performance and extensive career development opportunity with an organisation that is poised to expand exponentially over the coming years. 
 If you would like to discuss this outstanding leadership opportunity in confidence then please contact Matt Harris for more information.
