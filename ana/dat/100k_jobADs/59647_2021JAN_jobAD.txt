 Customer Service Team Leader 
 Permanent role based in Sheffield 
 up to £35,000 + benefits 
 My client is a large FTSE 250 FMCG business that is going through a company wide transformation programme. Part of the transformation programme involves significant change and improvement of their contact centre to create a global centre of excellence. Therefore my client has created 2 team leader roles to help drive changes to their system and processes in order to keep surprising and delighting their customers. 
 Day to day you will play an active customer service role whilst leading team of 5 staff. You will be processing orders, managing the inbox of requests and follow ups, taking calls from customers and clients, dealing with issues and complaints and generally act as the first point of escalation for any concerns. Both these two team lead roles look after extremely busy areas and your team can be fielding in excess of 150 calls per day. 
 You will have had previous team leading experience to make a success of the role as it will be your job to monitor KPI's, make sure all heath and safety commitments are fulfilled, take ownership of team training as required and make sure that your team are as productive and efficient as they can be to deliver a world class service. 
 Please don't hesitate to apply for the role or send your CV I will endeavour to respond to all relevant applications within 3 working days however I might not have time to respond to those that are not relevant. 
 By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited. Our Privacy Policy is available on our website and explains how we will use your data.
