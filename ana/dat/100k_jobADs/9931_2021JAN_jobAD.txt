 justinnabit89  replied to the topic  Do dentists really apply biosafety in their dental practice?  in the forum  Dental Job   2 years, 5 months ago 
 biosafety is given importance in developed countries and in different levels. Infection control and prevention is a major topic of discussion in countries like Australia but I would not expect them to be the same in countries such as India.

 charles85  replied to the topic  What to study in preparation for OMFS residency  in the forum  Dental Job   2 years, 9 months ago 
 It may depend from program to program as role of an intern varies. You should ask your program’s residents. Wound healing, infection management, and trauma are good topics. If your program provides trach service for the hospital, post-op trach management would be a topic worth looking into as well.

 catherine78  replied to the topic  Is it true that when the lower teeth are extracted they hurt more than the upper  in the forum  Dental Job   2 years, 11 months ago

 The lower jaw consists of cancellous bone with a thin outer layer of compact bone. 
 The real determinant of the amount of pain and length of time to heal after an extraction is the size of the tooth and the difficulty of the surgery.

 husanyua34  replied to the topic  Can a tooth extraction only solution of pericoronitis ?  in the forum  Dental Job   3 years, 6 months ago 
 Pericoronitis should and usually does resolve on its own, without antibiotics. Typically, antibiotics are not needed for routine extractions. There is a chance of infection forming, but following the dentist’s instructions will keep the risk small. These usually include avoiding suction in the mouth, as well as food with small particles like n… [Read more]
