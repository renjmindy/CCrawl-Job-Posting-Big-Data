 My 52 Sundays 
 A Day Of Rest With The Lord 
 Jay 
 God must have favored me for some reason. Through zero effort of my own and for reasons I do not fully understand, I am so so so blessed. 
 I have been loved by a wonderful woman for over 33 years. God gave me two daughters who have the courage, strength, and knowledge among many other adjectives in order to mold me to the man I am today. 
 I pray to the Lord and thank him for sending an incredible man into my oldest daughters life, a man I am proud to call son. 
 In 2011 the good Lord blessed me with a grandson, and in 2013 the blessing continued with the arrival of my granddaughter. 
 I feel as though if at this very moment that God chooses to never bless me again for the rest of my days on earth, I have been given way more than I could ever deserve. 
 I'm here to tell you that God's grace is truly EPIC!

 Every Job A Parable - A Book Review 
 Every Job A Parable by John Van Sloten is a book that challenges us to see our job in a new light, and prompts us to answer the question, "What does my job tell us about God?" 
 “to help kindle a new kind of vocational imagination, to help you experience God at work more, and to help you read the parable that is your job.” 
 If your like me, there are times when I wonder if what I do for a living makes a difference, does it matter? Am I just working at working? Better yet, are questions like, "Do you think your job is important to God? Does God think your job is important to Him?" John answers these questions in this book. He shows us that any job can be used to glorify God. Every job provides the opportunity to serve Him. 
 I think this book would be great in a small group setting. Very honest and eye opening conversations could be had with people from different vocations as you explore what work would be like if we viewed it as another way to serve God. 
 John Van Sloten is a pastor, teacher and writer who lives in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. For the past 20 years he's been exploring a worldview that seeks to discern God's voice in all things: the Bible, the arts, sport, science, film, music, literature, history, mathematics, nature and human nature. 
 4 out of 5 stars. 
 You can get the book  HERE 
 I am blessed to have received a copy of this book for free from Tyndale Publishers for review purposes. I received no other compensation and the review is my own honest opinion of the book. 
 Be good to each other, Jay
