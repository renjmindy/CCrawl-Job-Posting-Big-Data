 Raising Boys Is Hard, But I'm Still Thankful I Got The Job. 
 I always thought raising a teenage daughter would be challenging. From empowering her to be the best she can be to making sure she doesn't get hurt by some boy or man. I had a lot to worry about. 
 I was wrong. Raising my two boys has been the hardest most frustrating thing I've ever done. From possibly being harmed by your own peer group, to doing something drastic to affirm you are the young men you say you are. Let's not forget the daily arguments reminding them to pick up after themselves, I constantly struggle with the fact that I might not be the best man for the job.

 Keith has over a decade of experience in the field, counseling and coaching individuals, couples, teens and their parents to help them improve their relationships and their ability to achieve their personal goals. For the past seven years Keith has developed specific programs to help teens and their families achieve success in all facets of their lives that may have eluded them in the past. Academics, relationships, athletics, college preparation and applications, goal setting and developing specific plans are areas where working with Keith as a Coach can help young people set the patterns that promise a brilliant future. He works with couples to help them achieve the kind of relationship they envisioned when they first made their commitment to each other. Strengthening communication and revitalizing their understanding and empathy for each other helps couples regain the romance and closeness they long for – even in their everyday “real” world. Having a coach is like having a GPS for life. Keith can help you get a realistic picture of where you are and focus on the best path forward toward your goals. Unlike counseling, coaching focuses on the future, not the past.   View all posts by ilovestrong
