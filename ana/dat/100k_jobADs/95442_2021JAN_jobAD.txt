 What is a Facilities Coordinator? 
 Facilities coordinators are in charge of the maintenance of a building. This usually refers to the premises of a company but it could be a residential building, too. They ensure that these buildings are safe and that all equipment and devices (e.g. garbage disposal) operate properly. 
 What does a Facilities Coordinator do? 
 Facilities coordinators oversee all activities inside a building, making sure that health and safety standards are met and arranging for repairs when needed. They usually report to the facilities manager and the two of them work together in tracking expenses and coordinating with external vendors. 
 In smaller buildings, these two roles could overlap. On the other hand, companies with multiple offices could hire one facilities coordinator for each building and one facilities manager to oversee them all. 
 Facilities Coordinator duties include: 
 
 Fixing minor issues in appliances or arranging for repairs when needed 
 Ensuring compliance with health and safety regulations 
 Removing hazardous materials from all areas accessible to employees and guests
