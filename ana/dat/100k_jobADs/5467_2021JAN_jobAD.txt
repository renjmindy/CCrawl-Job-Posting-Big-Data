 How to apply for an English teaching job in China 
 
 Relocating to another country can be stressful and time-consuming; to avoid this we try to make each part of the process as simple and fast as possible. 
 Below we have outlined the process and everything you will need to provide/do at each stage. 
 Interview with our recruiters 
 To start off with, you will need to submit an application by filling out our  online application form . 
 In order for us to start looking for a job, we will ask you to send us your CV via email. 
 Once we have reviewed your CV and approved your application for progression, we will schedule an interview via Skype to discuss the job, assess your English speaking skills and accent and answer your questions. 
 Most schools that we work with teach kids from 3 to 12 years old, so we're looking for teachers with energy, enthusiasm, patience, and professionalism. 
 Treat the interview with us as you would any other job interview. 
 We want to get you on your teaching adventure, but we're also committed to offering our schools the best educators out there. 
 That being said, we're really looking forward to meeting you! 
 Securing a job and getting a salary offer 
 If you passed the first interview successfully, we will contact you within 48 hours asking for the following: 
 
 
 A clear photo of the first page of your passport (feel free to censor any sensitive information as long as we can see your name, date of birth, nationality, and photo) 
 
 
 A 2-minute video introducing yourself. In order for us to start looking for a job, we need your introduction video: outside with good daylight, smiling during the video, at least 2 minutes long, talking about your education, work experience, why you want to come to China, why you like China, hobbies, interests, etc. Check out  this guide  on how to record a great video. 
 
 
 A casual photo of yourself 
 
 
 (we require these documents for a number of reasons such as proving your identity and qualifications. 
 We cannot progress without them so make sure you send everything over as soon as possible!) 
 If your first interview is successful, you will have another call with one of our Senior Recruiters to get an individual offer based on your qualifications and skills. 
 Once all the terms are agreed upon, we send you the contract to sign. 
 Once you sign it, we stamp it, send you the copy and start looking for a school using the information you provided (CV, self-introduction video). 
 Flight tickets 
 You purchase flight tickets according to the start dates in the contract you signed, and once we know specific dates of arrival, we start arranging a job with a specific school, taking into account your location preferences, available vacancies in specific cities, and other conditions to provide the best placement possible. 
 Get Ready for Work! 
 Now that the contract is signed and flight tickets purchased, it is time to prepare all the documents for your visa. 
 Our recruiters will set up a call with you to tell you in detail how to apply and what documents to prepare. 
 Preparing necessary documents will take 1-1,5 months, so make sure you get everything ready on time before your departure. 
 As you make preparations, keep the following in mind: you'll need to bring your valid passport and all the documents in printer version with you. 
 While you can get the most common items (e.g. toiletries, medications, eyeglasses, etc.) make sure that essential prescriptions are available in your destination country. 
 And if you have any questions along the way, Work and Live in China team is here to help! 
 Continued Support 
 Work and Live in China is with you every step of the way. 
 We meet you at the airport upon arrival, provide a hotel, transportation, training (if necessary), and accompany you until you arrive at your school. 
 After you start teaching, we provide 24/7 support during the year with any questions. 
 Navigating a new environment is challenging. The food, the work, and the community you now call home can really surprise you in ways both good and bad. 
 So if you ever need help, Work and Live in China is here for you. We have skilled teacher trainers here to assist with career development. 
 Our support staff is constantly in touch with school managers and can help smooth the path to communication. Or maybe you just had a bad day, miss home, and need some perspective on the adventure you've undertaken. 
 Every step of the way, we're here for you. 
 After You 're Done 
 Your contract may be over, but that doesn't mean your adventure needs to end. 
 Work and Live in China Recruitment works with schools in more than 150 cities across China. 
 And once you get one position with us, it's just that much easier to find a new job in an exciting new location. 
 Stay in touch so that we can keep the adventure going. 
 If you have any questions, just apply online and we will contact you by email.
