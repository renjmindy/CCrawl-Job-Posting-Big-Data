 How's your voiceover game coming along? 
 The past few weeks via #  VoiceoverCamp   we've been discussing how to get started in this lucrative branch of acting. 
 This week we talk agents. 
​ 
Do you have commercial representation? How about legit? Check out this week's video to find out if you need separate representation and  more . 
 Likewise, we want you to know your worth as a VO artist and will be sharing some GREAT resources to help you negotiate and be aware of your rate and how much you should be paid for various gigs! 
 Let's get in to it! 
 So what do you think? 
​ 
Is it time to look for a VO agent? OR are you ready to be your own agent? 
 Need to catch up on our last few videos? You can check out the full   Voiceover Camp Series   here! 
 PLUS, I have created a Free VO Starter Kit just for YOU! 
Get it BELOW!

 Thanks again Elise and Amy for that information. This was very helpful to me because I have a agent but here in the NW she said there is mostly Commercial Voiceover work. So I want to get into animated movies and audio books. So I am on both Voiceover.com and Love the edgestudio.com because they also have a contest you can try out for and scripts and you can also listen to other Voiceover artist which helps me a lot as well.
