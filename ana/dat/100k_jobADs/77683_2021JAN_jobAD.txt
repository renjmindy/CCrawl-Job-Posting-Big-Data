 Credit Kudos is a venture-backed fintech startup and challenger credit bureau that uses financial behaviour to measure creditworthiness. 💳 Our technology transforms the way credit checking and credit scores work by generating a more accurate and holistic view of a borrower's creditworthiness. We’re working with lenders to help them make better, fairer credit decisions and with consumers to help them access fair, affordable credit. ⚖️ Our mission is to transform the credit scoring system to provide fairer credit for all; helping people access responsible finance they can afford, when they need it. 🤝 How it all began: After working in the US for a number of years, Freddy returned to the UK ✈️. Having had no recent financial activity in the UK, he had a 'thin' credit file. This not only meant that he had limited credit options, but those that were available to him came with higher interest rates and restrictions 🙁. After further research it became apparent that he was not alone, and that many people in the UK face difficulties when trying to get access to affordable credit 💳. With a vision to remove that challenge from the market, Freddy and Matt founded Credit Kudos 👋. Since then, the team at Credit Kudos have been on a mission to provide fair credit for all, harnessing the power of Open Banking 🌍. We’re building a credit bureau the right way - with the customer involved and transparent throughout. We’re looking for talented and creative engineers who share our vision. 🚀
