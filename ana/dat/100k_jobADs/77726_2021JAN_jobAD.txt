  4 Things That Destroy Job Interviews  
 Michael Price 
 August 03, 2015 
 Job interviews have never worried me. It's actually something I'm really good at. In fact, I've never been turned down for a job I interviewed for and I've always walked out with a compensation package better than what I hoped for.

 4 Things That Destroy Job Interviews 
 Here are four things that you should never do in an interview, along with some tips on things you should do instead. Doing these four things will absolutely ensure that you bomb, fail and completely ruin a job interview. 
 1. Overly Rehearsed 
 You should go into an interview prepared to answer some of the most commonly asked interview questions. If you don't know what they are, Google is your friend. It's worth taking a deep dive and preparing your answers to these questions ahead of time. You should really take this process seriously. However, don't take it so seriously that you appear as though you've been coached and are overly rehearsed. The interviewer will be able to tell and this gives off the feeling that you're being dishonest, because when people prepare for an interview, then tend to gravitate towards painting a picture of themselves as if they're Mona Lisa, when in actuality no one is perfect. 
 2. Inappropriate Interview Attire 
 Workplace attire has changed tremendously in the past five years. Many companies now have a more relaxed environment. It's either business casual or completely casual. It's possible that you may have to flip the funnel of conventional wisdom, which states that you should always come to an interview dressed in a suit and tie, or for ladies, a skirt and a blouse. Your attire should match what your interviewer will be wearing. The best way to figure this out in advance is to ask the person you've been in contact with who has setup your interview. Making sure you're dressed appropriately is important because if you're under-dressed, you'll look like you don't take the job seriously. If you're over-dressed, you'll upset the power dynamic and the interviewer may feel uncomfortable interviewing someone who looks like they're in a higher position of power than they are. 
 3. Overly Excited 
 Your interviewer isn't your bestie. In fact, they're not even an acquaintance. You don't even know this person, so don't be overly excited when meeting with them and conversing with them. It looks very fake and is very off-putting. The only scenario where this actually makes sense and works is if the person you're being interviewed by is this way. If they're overly excited, not only is it ok for you to be, it's critical. What's important to understand is that you match the interviewer's behavior. This includes their posture, tone and mannerisms. This will make them more comfortable with you and you'll grab their attention immediately. 
 4. Laying Out Your Demands 
 There's no secret that people have jobs because they have bills to pay, but the interview is often times not the place to bring up these discussions. Your objective in an interview should be the same as the interviewer's, which is to get answers to questions and make sure you're a good fit. If you're concerned about salary and benefits you can research your potential package online by doing various Google searches to learn more about the company. Depending on the size of the company, you can also use Glassdoor.com for detailed information that's been reported from former or current employees.
