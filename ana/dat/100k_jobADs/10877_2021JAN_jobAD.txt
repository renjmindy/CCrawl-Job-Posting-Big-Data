  Jenny Newby and Lee Riley  are two of our favourite  Gogglebox  stars and we can’t wait to hear their hilarious one-liners every Friday night 
 But what else is there to learn about the caravan besties? 
 Here is everything you need to know.

 The best friends are from Hull and film from Lee’s caravan in  Patrington Haven  caravan park. 
 Fans were shocked to learn that the place they film in is actually home to Lee, 51, rather than Jenny, 64, as most viewers had assumed.

 The pair have been isolating together for the duration of the current series, which is how they have been able to appear together each week. 
 While Lee’s job is unknown, Gogglebox stars get paid £1,500 a month per family, according to  The Sun.

 Meanwhile, we do know that Jenny used to work as a pub landlady, which is how she originally met Lee who was one of her regulars. 
 Jenny told Ireland’s Big Issue Magazine: “Lee was a customer at my pub, The Crown Inn in Paull. 
 “He became a regular in 1994 and used to come in pretty much every night with his partner and we were friends from the off. 
 “We’ve been best friends ever since.” 
 The duo had a surprise guest in the form of Lee's partner Steven in a recent episode of Gogglebox

 The two immediately became inseparable, and often go on holiday together, usually to Cyprus to visit Lee’s partner, Steve. 
 Lee has been with his partner Steve Mail for 26 years and last month took to social media to wish him a happy birthday. 
 Steve lives in Cyprus which has meant that the pair have been separated during the pandemic.

 Meanwhile, Jenny has been married to her husband Ray who prefers to stay private and has never appeared on the show. 
 Jenny and Lee joined the fourth series of the show back in 2014 after Jenny was approached by two Channel 4 researchers at Beverley Races Ladies’ Day. 
 Lee wasn’t sold on the idea at first, telling The Hull Daily Mail: “To be honest and I didn’t want to do it.

 "I’d say it took her about an hour and a half to talk me into it – about as long as it took me to get me out of bed.” 
 The best friends say they’ve never had an argument, mainly because they are too busy making each other laugh. 
 “I don’t think we’ve ever had an argument. We’re too placid to argue. She makes me laugh too much for me to ever fall out with her,” Lee told his local paper.
