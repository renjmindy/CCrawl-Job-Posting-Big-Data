  4 Myths About Job Hunting During A Recession  
 Aaron Sanborn 
 May 08, 2020 
 The COVID-19 crisis has sent the economy into recession and impacted numerous careers. 
 While people are naturally on edge right now, it's important to know that while searching for a job during a recession isn't easy, it's not impossible. 
 
 As a result of the COVID-19 crisis, the U.S. unemployment rate hit 14.7% in April, as 20.5 million jobs vanished in a month, according to the  Associated Press. 
 With this many people out of work, there will be a lot more competition for open positions. You'll need to be especially prepared for the job search process. Here are four common myths about the job search process during a recession. 
 Myth 1: No One Hires During A Recession 
 Businesses are always hiring! 
 There are some businesses that are greatly impacted by recessions that will reduce staff, implement hiring freezes, and others that will slow their hiring, but in general there's always some need to hire people as a result of vacancies and retirements. In addition, there are  some industries  that continue to do well in a recession. 
 However, while businesses are still hiring during a recession, the job competition will be greater and you'll need to work harder to market yourself as an employee worth hiring. There are  multiple ways  you can make yourself a better candidate, this includes finding ways to upskill, networking, and improving your resume and writing a  disruptive cover letter. 
 Myth 2: No One Will Hire You After Getting Laid Off 
 Layoffs are a fact of life and businesses realize that. 
 But from a competition standpoint being laid off puts you at an initial disadvantage. Layoffs are common during a recession. This increases the competition because of the amount of people on the job market in need of work. 
 If you're laid off, you have to work even harder to market yourself to potential employees. But at the same time, you don't want to come across as too desperate. Like with any job search, do your research and leverage your  professional network  whenever you can. 
 You may also want to consider which industries are still hiring during the recession and taking a job in one of those industries to hold you over.  There's no shame in working outside of your desired industry, there may even be  benefits to it . 
 Given the circumstances of COVID-19 and the recession, future employers will understand the career detour. 
 Myth 3: If You're Over 50, You Won't Get Hired

 Age discrimination is a topic that comes up from time to time but in reality it's actually called experience discrimination. 
 People over the age of 50 are staying in the workforce a lot longer but have to compete with millennials that make up more than half of the workforce. These millennials are highly skilled, tech savvy, and a lot cheaper to employ. 
 This means that anyone over 50 looking to get hired needs to work even harder to get noticed. You need to clearly understand and sell what it is that you do well (your specialty). You also need to invest in yourself and be willing to upskill whenever you can. 
 Myth 4: You'll Have To Take Less Money

 Finding a job during a recession doesn't mean an automatic pay cut! 
 Recession or not, you should prepare for a typical  salary negotiation  process. Do your research and have an idea of the competitive rate for the position you're pursuing. 
 If you've settled on a salary range, be ready to prove to the company why you would be worth the investment. You can do this by demonstrating why you'd be a valuable asset to the company and how your unique skills/experiences will make you the best fit for the role. 
 It always comes back to marketing yourself. 
 Recessions come and go and  we will get through this one!  Recession or not, one thing about the job search process remains true —  you have to work hard and be your own best advocate.
