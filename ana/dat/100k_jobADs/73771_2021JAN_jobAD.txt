 Career Discovery week insights: The Lidl graduate programme through the eyes of a graduate - Part 1 
 It’s   vital to hear about a graduate programme from the decision makers and those who run the programme, but it’s also important to hear from those who have experienced it first-hand, the graduates themselves. 
 In a three-part series of blogs, we will look at the Lidl graduate programme through the eyes of the graduates who have completed the programme and have been offered positions upon completion. 
 In fact, to date 100% of graduates on the 2018/2019 Lidl graduate programme have been offered a role in project manager positions. 
 In this blog we will hear from  Will Power  about his graduate journey through the accounts and finance stream of the Lidl graduate programme.

 IN DETEAIL: 
 How did you discover the Lidl graduate programme? 
 "  During my final year in college, I researched a number of graduate programmes online and through attending graduate careers fairs. Along the way Lidl really grabbed my attention.  " 
 You said you researched a number of graduate programmes but what made Lidl stand out? 
 " The variety of experience being offered across all areas of the business was something I hadn’t really seen when researching other programmes. I wasn’t just going to be sitting at a desk reading about how the business worked, I was going to be out and about living it and experiencing it, ‘hands on’ by leading, delivering and rolling out real-world projects which add value to the business. That type of challenge really appealed to me, so I decided to apply." 
 What for you is a standout aspect of the programme? 
 " The exposure to all aspects of the business you gain from day one of the programme is something I found really beneficial. Because of it, I now have a strong network of people that I can rely on from all over the business, from Store Managers to Regional Directors, the list is endless!" 
 What did a typical day on the programme look like for you? 
 " Not to sound cliché, but there really isn’t a typical day in Lidl. While I did have my core responsibilities and targets to achieve, I also got continuous exposure to other aspects of the business through specific training, workshops, projects, departments open days and graduate fundraising events. Retail is such a fast paced and diverse sector, and here at Lidl there are always new challenges and opportunities arising for me to tackle. On the Graduate Programme I was given an opportunity to project manage a team across several departments. Not only did the project have huge cost savings but it also gave me added management responsibility. Having the ability to put my own stamp on things so early in the programme was essential in improving my confidence not to mention the support along the way from my Director mentor and grad buddy." 
 What advice would you give to someone who is looking to apply to the programme? 
 "If yo  u are looking for a job that will give you responsibility, push you out of your comfort zone and allow you to gain a huge amount of personal and professional development then you should definitely apply for the Lidl Graduate Programme. "
