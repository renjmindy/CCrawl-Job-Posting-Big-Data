 The key to a successful career; and everything else. 
 Posted by Leanne January 10, 2012 Posted in branding ,  business ,  inspirational ,  marketing ,  Social media 
 Is simple! Do what you love, and love what you do. 
 Have you heard this statement before? Are you doing what you love? 
 Sometimes I think the challenge of publishing a post like this is that most of us may have already heard this statement, or something similar. Then again, how many of us actually do something about it? 
 Did you know that wisdom is only wisdom when we put knowledge, and understanding into practice. 
 Lets not be hearer's of the good advice we expose ourselves to this year. Instead take this little piece of encouragement and go do something about it, or as Seth Godin puts it; Go make something happen.
