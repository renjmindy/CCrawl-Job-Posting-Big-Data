  3 Pre-Interview Confidence Boosters  
 CareerBliss 
 Jenna Arcand 
 September 17, 2020 
   
 Sweaty palms. Shaky voice. Blank mind. These symptoms of nervousness can seriously sabotage a job interview, no matter how prepared and qualified you are. To quell these natural responses and help you muster more confidence in anxious situations, consider these quick pre-interview confidence boosters so you can perform better right before your next job interview—no energy drinks or cheesy motivational speeches required! 
 Amy Cuddy, social psychologist of Harvard Business School, talked about what people do while do while waiting for a job interview to start in a popular  TEDGlobal presentation . “You're sitting down. You're looking at your iPhone or Android. You're looking at your notes." This common waiting room behavior is not really ideal for maximizing your confidence right before an interview. Instead, the following activities will make you way more confident before meeting a potential boss: 
 1. Strike A Power Pose For Two Minutes 
 According to Cuddy, rather than hunching up and making yourself small in the waiting room chair as you scramble to soak up last minute notes or practice one final  interview question , you should actually find a private place to do what Cuddy calls a power pose. There are a few different variations, but the Wonder Woman pose is really easy to remember. So, 10 minutes before your interview, go somewhere private, like the bathroom, and strike a strong pose where you can take up as much space as possible. 
 2. Repeat A Positive Affirmation 
 "Repeating a positive affirmation can reduce production of cortisol and  stress hormones  by almost 50%, slow the mind, lower your blood pressure and heart rate and make you feel confident and powerful," says Kathleen Hall, founder and CEO of The Mindful Living Network and the Stress Institute. Hall offers the following examples: I am confident in all things. I have unlimited potential. Joyce Marter, psychotherapist and CEO of Urban Balance, would agree and suggests deep breathing while you recite a positive mantra in your head, "using language you will want to use in the interview, such as 'I absolutely will succeed in this job if given the opportunity.'" You might feel a little silly at first, but these words will help you emit a more positive appearance—and that sure beats a nervous one! 
 3. Read Over Nice Things People Have Said About You 
 Thinking back to a time when you were successful and confident is a great way to recreate that confidence right before an interview. A quick and easy way to do this is to print out and compile anything nice someone has said about you. Read old letters of recommendation,  LinkedIn endorsements , letters, or notes from colleagues or teachers that have boosted your confidence in the past. If you're not really feeling this method, "Quickly review your biggest accomplishments in your head before going into the interview," says Katherine Walker, founder and executive director of Lifetime Behavioral Health. "This trip down memory lane will instantly create a sense of confidence and serve to get your brain thinking about items the interviewer will no doubt ask you about." It's the best way to remind yourself that all of your previous experiences have helped shape you and prepare you to succeed in this job interview! 
 Many professionals struggle with confidence during the job search, and especially before an interview. We hope these three tips will help you feel more confident during your next interview so you can land that dream job! Need more help with your job search?

  Back To Work? 10 Tips For Relaunching Your Career  
 CareerBliss 
 Jenna Arcand 
 July 01, 2020 
   
 So, you've been on a career break. How long has it been? Three years, five years, more? Whether you took time off to care for your children or to travel the world, relaunching your career is a major undertaking, especially these days. Just sending out a bunch of resumes won't do the trick. 
 Here are some effective tips and steps for relaunching your career you can start doing immediately to help you reach your goal of getting back into the workforce: 
 1. Get Your Story Straight 
 Prospective employers are going to ask you what you've been doing for the last few years. Make sure you have the story down pat and can tell it confidently. Don't be sheepish.  Taking a break from work, whatever the reason (save incarceration), was a choice you made, and you don't need to apologize for it. Everything you say should be true, of course, but you choose what the takeaway of the story is. Second, you're going to need to have a good answer for the question of why you're getting back into the workforce. Note:  "I have a mortgage to pay; gambling debts; or momma needs a new pair of shoes,"  are not good responses. You don't want to seem needy or desperate. To come up with a good answer, think about those things you loved about your job before you took your break. Talk about the passion you had for your career, about your craving for intellectual stimulation, about your ambition. It's also important to think of these things in context of each job you're applying for. Why do you want to work for this specific company? What problem do you want to help them solve? How do you connect with their mission and values as an organization? Asking yourself all of these questions will help you get your  career story  straight before going into your first job interviews.  
 2. Stay Connected (Or Reconnect) To Your Career 
 When you take your break, you don't have to turn your back on your career altogether. Look for opportunities to stay connected. This can mean consulting, volunteering, or freelancing. It's a matter of keeping at least one toe in the work realm. Kelly, for instance, worked as a graphic designer for a major newspaper until she decided to leave the daily grind to care for her young son. To stay connected to her field, Kelly began freelancing every Sunday for her former employer. She also kept her skills honed by designing a monthly newsletter for her moms club. Through these efforts, Kelly remained close to her profession and continued to build her portfolio even while on a career break. If you haven't stayed connected to your career throughout your break, it's not too late to reconnect.  In fact, reconnecting should be a key part of your career relaunch strategy. Immediately start accepting projects—even if it's free work for friends or nonprofits. It will pay off in the end. Don't pass up any opportunity. 
 3. Revise Your Resume And Get It Online 
 It's time to dust off your resume. First, fill in the gaps with all that good work-related stuff you've been doing during your break. Even if it was a volunteer project, list it just as you would any other work experience (though you don't necessarily need to use the word "volunteer").  Do some research to make sure your  resume will get past the ATS .  Many experts these days, for example, recommend ditching the "objective" portion at the top of the resume and instead replace it with hard skills and keywords mentioned in the job description that you have developed in your career. To find pertinent keywords, do a little research. Look at  online job postings  and see the kind of words that employers are using in their posts, then use these words in your resume. Once your resume is keyword-optimized, you can then focus on customizing it for each job you're applying for, to give yourself a better chance of getting an interview.  
 4. Network 
 First, reconnect with your former colleagues and professional friends. Meet for coffee. Talk shop. Let them know you're looking for work. Don't be shy about telling family members, friends, and acquaintances that you're looking for new opportunities. Most people get jobs through personal connections. Then, widen your circle. Try to attend a business networking event every week. Even a  remote networking  event can open new doors. Much has been written about how people should approach networking, and a little research on the topic may be helpful.  In general, remember that your goal for networking isn't instant gratification.  Many experts will tell you not to expect (and never, never, never ask for) a job at a networking event. You're there to meet people and build relationships. Eventually it will pay off. To find networking opportunities, ask people you already know or search on the internet. A simple Google search (city + state + "networking opportunities") should turn up results. Also, try websites like  Meetup  and  Eventbrite . 
 5. Use Social Media 
 More and more job seekers are using social media websites for networking, and employers are using them to find out about job candidates.  Use social media sites, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter to build your  personal brand , make new connections and further your relaunch efforts. On LinkedIn, it's important to optimize your profile and make sure it matches your resume. Also, avoid making common  LinkedIn headline mistakes . With a strong social media presence, you'll stand out to recruiters and hiring managers, and they'll see how proactive you are with trying to relaunch your career.  
 6. Get Involved 
 Look for opportunities, above and beyond attending  networking events , to get involved. Start a blog related to your field. Check out existing blogs and online forums and comment on posts. Share your opinion. Offer advice. Establish yourself as an active member of the community. Host a networking event, or take on a volunteer position within a networking group. Take a class. These things will supercharge your networking efforts. The more you're involved in your community and industry, the more others will view you as an expert in that field.  Don't be afraid to start something new. Get out there, get involved, and make a name for yourself! 
 7. Cast A Wide Net 
 When looking at job opportunities, think outside of the box. Don't think of yourself in terms of past work experience alone.  Assess your skills, and determine how they can be applied to different jobs.  These are your  transferable skills . They can be extremely helpful when trying to relaunch your career, especially if you're making a career change. Know what you can do, and be ready to tell prospective employers how your skills can benefit them—even in a position you've never held before. Think about what jobs have the best potential for  career happiness . 
 8. Don't Pass Up Opportunities 
 Sure, you're looking for full-time work.  But as you relaunch your career, don't pass up part-time, contract, or freelance opportunities, as long as they move your relaunch efforts forward.  (Part-time at the local mini-mart, for instance, wouldn't do much good.) A contract position could lead to a  job offer , and in the meantime you're gaining new experience, building relationships, and adding to your resume. 
 9. Prepare For The Interview 
 Eventually, the day will come: a prospective employer will want to meet with you. A job interview can be particularly daunting to someone who's been on a career break.  The best remedy for a case of interview-related nerves is preparation. Think about what questions will be asked, and how you will answer (remember tip number one?).  Research the company  online. Formulate some smart  interview questions to ask  in return. Have a friend help you practice with a  mock interview . The more prepared you are, the more confident you will be. 
 10. Keep At It 
 The best advice for relaunching your career? Don't give up.  You didn't get to where you were before your career break without hard work and perseverance. And it will take those qualities to get back to where you want to be. 
 If you want to relaunch your career, just know that you can and will. Half the battle is having the right mindset. The rest is all about strategy. Follow these 10 tips to successfully relaunch your career, no matter how long you've been out of the game. Looking for a job? We can help!

  6 Tips For Following Up After A Job Interview  
 CareerBliss 
 July 23, 2015 
   
 If you’re not using the best, most effective methods of following up after a job interview, you’re missing out on the chance to score some easy points that just could push you over the top and out of the unemployment line.  Related:   The Best Interview Follow Up Checklist  Make sure you’re going above and beyond to impress interviewers and secure the job. Here are some guidelines for the perfect interview follow-up strategy. 
 1\. Sooner Is Better  In a recent CareerBliss Poll asking how soon people follow up after a job interview, 39 percent of respondents said they do it the next day. Good answer, according to Career Expert, Vicky Oliver. Oliver, author of  301 Smart Answers to Tough Interview Questions , said the best time to reach out after an interview is within 24 hours. The 61 percent of poll respondents who said they wait two to three days, a week or never follow-up should take note. “If you’re incredibly lucky,” Oliver said, “the interviewer will hit the e-mail back to you saying she/he really enjoyed meeting you and – voila! – now you’re in the running! These rules apply even if an executive recruiter helped you land the interview.”  2\. The 3-Paragraph Rule  Your follow-up e-mail should be short, sweet and personalized. Generally, a good rule of thumb for the length is three paragraphs, with no more than two to three sentences in each paragraph.    First Paragraph:  Briefly thank them for their time and reiterate your interest in the position.   Second Paragraph:  Discuss a couple of your strengths and how the company would benefit if you were hired. Consider using bullet points to break up your text.   Third Paragraph:  Include any points of clarifications you might have. Include answers to questions that you weren’t able to answer during the interview, or add new info about yourself that was left out of the interview. But, remember, keep it brief.    Oliver suggests indicating your next point of contact by saying something along the lines of “Look forward to hearing from you within the next two weeks.” If no date was set at the interview, either ask for one or specify you will loop back to them for a decision in two weeks.  3\. Splurge On The Good "Thank You" Paper  Sending a hand-written thank you note via snail mail adds a charming touch, and further showcases your gratitude for their time. Go all out for this gesture. Practice your handwriting. Splurge and spend the extra money for high-quality paper – it will show prospective employers you value their time, and also will speak well of your attention to detail.  4\. Double Check Their Names  Candidates should “double check the spelling of the interviewer’s name, his or her title, and the address of the company,” Oliver said. While you’re at it, don’t forget to spell-check the entire letter – both e-mail and snail mail. These steps may seem obvious, but all too often minor spelling and grammatical blunders get through, making the candidate look careless.  5\. Avoid Follow-Up Faux Pas  After you have written your notes, double check to ensure that you have avoided these common mistakes:    Repetition   Negativity   Cheesy emoticons and exclamation points   Informal language   Grammar/spelling errors     6\. Don’t Call Them, They’ll Call You  Usually, toward the end of an interview, hiring managers will indicate a general time for when they will contact you. If this was not addressed, be sure to ask them to give you an idea in your initial follow-up e-mail. Only call the employer if that date has passed. Call any time before then and you will come off as desperate and bothersome. What are your thoughts? Are there other tips for following up after a job interview?

  6 Real-Life Cover Letter Blunders To Avoid  
 CareerBliss 
 July 17, 2015 
   
 A cover letter can be the first step of a new career journey. Or, it can be a dead end that dooms your attempts to get a job. It all has to do with how you write it. Have you made any of these cover letter blunders?  Download:   FREE Cover Letter Tutorial & Template  We collected some real-life examples of dead-end  cover letters  to serve as examples of what not to do the next time you’re making first contact with a prospective employer. 
 1\. Self-Serving   “I’m interested in seeing what your firm can do to help me find new clients…”   FYI : Whoever is vetting candidates doesn’t care all that much about what the company can do for you. She’s interested in what you can do for the company. And she has the luxury of being self-serving in that regard. The job seeker, typically, does not. In your cover letter, avoid describing how you can benefit from the job – write about how the company can benefit from hiring you. Your letter should succinctly put your experience and skills in the context of the job you’re hoping to get. The employer has a need – it’s your job to demonstrate that you can fulfill that need. And if you can prove that, you’ll be closer to fulfilling your need for income, career development, and so on.  2\. Desperate   “I’m currently looking for any paying position freelance, part-time, or full-time.”   FYI : If  desperation  had an odor, it would be somewhere between rotten eggs and microwaved fish – something people would want to get away from. Fast. And like those people in the preceding stink scenario, hiring managers avoid desperation. You’ll never get a job just because you  need  a job. A prospective employer wants you to want to work for his company. To him, the company is a special place. He wants to feel that it would be special to you, too – that working there would be a milestone in your career and you’d give all you could to make it successful. Even if the bills are piling up and you desperately need a job – don’t let it show. Use your cover letter to describe why you want to work at that particular company.  3\. Irrelevant   “I’m married and at the present time, live in a farm located on the countryside … from where I attend to my clients online, grow organic vegetables and raise my two small daughters.”   FYI : You’re a person of varied interests, hobbies, and talents. You have kids or pets. You’re in a community acting troupe. Your chili took first prize at the annual cook off. But save all these personal tidbits for small talk with new co-workers after you actually get the job. Every word of your cover letter should aim to pique the interest of the person reading it enough to get them to take a look at your resume – and, once they do, the letter should put your resume in the context of the open position.  4\. Careless   “… and would love to offert my skills.”   FYI : If you don’t take the time to proofread and spellcheck your cover letter, a hiring manager  will  take the time to toss it in the wastebasket (or drag it to the recycling bin).  5\. Lacking   “Please see my resume attached. I look forward to speaking with you.”   FYI : The above is not an excerpt. It’s the whole cover letter. As mentioned earlier, your cover letter should aim to put your skills and experience in context with the job and get a hiring manager to move onto the next step of reading your resume. It should also help you start to build rapport with a prospective employer. The example above does none of those things.  6\. Lengthy   On the other hand, some cover letters we heard about went on for more than 1,000 words.   FYI : There’s a saying in the news business – burying the lede. That is, putting the most important or interesting info deep in the body of an article when it should be up top. If your cover letter drones on for 700, 800, 900 or more words, there’s a good chance you’re burying the lede under a bunch of superfluous stuff. Regardless if that’s the case, the very appearance of a novella-length cover letter is enough to turn off a hiring manager – especially when she has a hundred more cover letters waiting to be read. Keep it succinct – three or four short paragraphs max – and include only the information most likely to get someone to consider you a possible viable candidate and look at your resume. You’ll have plenty of opportunity to expound your experience once you get that interview.  This post was originally published at an earlier date.

  5 Things To Avoid When Breaking Up With Your Boss  
 CareerBliss 
 January 10, 2015 
   
 Quitting a job – quitting well, at least – can be hard work. There are plenty of missteps you can make that can end up hurting your career in the long term.  QUIZ:   Should You Quit Your Job?  Check out our list of things to avoid when breaking up with your boss. 
 1\. Don’t Pull A Johnny Paycheck  It’s been the subject of countless daydreams: quitting your job. You rise from your second-rate, back-breaking desk chair. You stride through the maze of cubicles, eyes forward, deftly deflecting queries and attempts at conversation from your colleagues –  Forget the expense report, Cathy .  No, Bill, I don’t have an opinion on the President’s jobs plan . And then you reach the door. It’s closed. No knocking today. You grasp the knob. Twist. Throw open the door. Finally, eye-to-eye with your nemesis, you deliver your attack: “Take this job and shove it.” (Yes… we know, Mr. Paycheck didn’t write the song. But he made it a hit.) Pretty sweet, huh? Yeah. But don’t do it.  Instead:  You must suppress the rage, stifle the snark, subdue the frustration. Smile. Be respectful. Give notice. Offer to help in the transition. It is, as the animatronic children at Disneyland say, a small world, after all. People talk… about you. And unless you’ve recently come into several million dollars and plan on leaving the workforce forever, a less-than-conciliatory exit can come back to bite you later in your career.  2\. Don’t Annoy Your Co-workers  You’re beginning to feel like an inmate –imprisoned unjustly, of course – with a release date just around the corner. All those people you work with, however, are still doing hard time… with no end in sight. Don’t talk about all the great stuff you’ll be doing once you’re on the outside.  Instead:  Leaving on good terms with your colleagues is just as important as leaving on good terms with your boss. Don’t badmouth the company you’re leaving, and don’t brag about that great new company you’re moving to. Answer questions honestly. But bear in mind that these people (some of whom you may actually like) are still stuck in the situation that you’re fleeing. You want them to have happy memories of you. Who knows, you may need one of them as a reference sometime, or even end up working with them again in the future.  3\. Don’t Act Like A Short-timer  You’ve given notice. See that down there, at the end of the tunnel? It’s light. Two more weeks and it’s on to bigger and better things for you (a new and  happier job , we hope). This can be a difficult time. While your body is there at your desk, your mind is far, far away. A little slacking is expected. Anyway, what are they going to do about it? Wrong attitude.  Instead:  Do your best to fend off short-timer syndrome. No matter how you feel about the company or your boss, you want to leave on a high note – be a pro to the end. In your final days, you should strive to work at the same level that you have during your entire tenure at the company. People aren’t necessarily going to remember that you put in back-to-back 18-hour days to finish a crucial, last-minute project two years ago. Colleagues – potential references and networking partners –  will  remember, however, that you came in late, slacked off and left early before abandoning them forever. You can never make another last impression.  4\. Don’t Get Lured Back  You have a new job lined up, or you’ve squirreled away enough money to sustain yourself for a  job search  (we advise the latter). Your mind is made up. You’re out of there. So long. Sayonara. See you later. And, then, they hit you with a counter offer to get you to stay. More money, more vacation, better benefits, promises that “things will get better next quarter.” Tempting. But don’t take it!  Instead:  The moment you gave notice, your relationship with your boss morphed into something that resembles the relationship between an estranged couple. Now your spurned boss, whatever his motives, has entered a bargaining phase that often accompanies a breakup ( I can change !). But things won’t get better, likely they’ll get worse. You’ve demonstrated your unhappiness and lack of loyalty by accepting a new job (though some say that employer/employee loyalty is, in fact, long dead). Stick to your plan. Just thank your boss for the consideration and inform him that you’ll still be moving on. Many sources say that most people who accept a counter offer end up leaving within six months, anyway.  5\. Don’t Hold A Grudge  And... you’re outta there. You cleared your desk of personal stuff, surrendered your iPhone and laptop, said your goodbyes and crossed that threshold for the last time. You strolled – maybe even swaggered – through the parking lot, fired up the car and headed off toward the horizon. Congratulations. You have made a successful exit. Finally, you can start trashing your former company, boss and colleagues to anyone who will listen. Wrong.  Instead:  Let the past be the past. Don’t go around badmouthing your former employer, especially not to a new or prospective employer (or through social media). You’ll come off as vindictive... and, maybe, even a bit obsessive. It’s not healthy for your career or your psyche. And you never know when you’ll run into these people again.  This post was originally published at an earlier date.

  What To Do If Your Boss Catches You Daydreaming At Work  
 CareerBliss 
 June 13, 2014 
   
 Like children, dogs, and nomads, minds tend to wander. And they often decide to wander at inopportune times – such as during that 4:30 meeting on the Friday before a long weekend.  Related:   Overworked? 5 Ways To Avoid Job Burnout  There you are in your Aloha shirt standing over a grill full of sizzling beef patties, hand wrapped around an icy bottle (or whatever your long weekend fantasy might be)… And then, BOOM, you hear your name, then a question – and your wandering mind is yanked through space and time back to the present. Back to the conference room. They’re all looking at you. And they want an answer. You’ve been caught daydreaming at work. So, what do you do? 
 1\. Stall  When a question comes your way and you haven’t been paying attention, don’t understand it, or just don’t have a response on the tip of your tongue, buy yourself some time by restating the question, suggests Christina Zila, president of the VYP Toastmasters. “Adding a neutral observation,” Zila continues, “like, ‘that’s a really interesting question’ also helps free your brain to concentrate on the question at hand.” Allow us to add: If you choose to stall by restating the question, restate it in such a way that makes it appear as though you’re trying to get clarification in order to provide a better answer. Avoid the following type of exchange: Boss: “So, valued employee, what do you think about the suggestion that we incubate front-end supply chains?” You: “Uh… what do I think about the suggestion that we incubate front-end supply chains?”  2\. Play Hot Potato  If you stalled but still can’t come up with something to say, try lobbing the question back at the person who asked it, says Zila. She suggests something along these lines:    Why is that important to you?   That’s a unique perspective.   How did you come to that idea?    “This buys you more time,” she says, “and gives you insight into the asker’s opinion or history with the subject.” But beware, both the Stall and the Hot Potato carry risk. “I really don’t appreciate hearing a question turned around into a statement just to tread water," says Mitchell Weiss, adjunct professor of finance at Hartford University. "I also have little respect for those who yammer on, for the same reason.”  3\. Pick A Small Tidbit  Rather than trying to give a comprehensive answer, choose to discuss just one small tidbit that you picked up before your mind started to wander, suggests Shannon Mouton of Topaz Consulting.  4\. Defer  Or, you can deflect the question and stroke a colleague’s ego at the same time. “If you really don’t have an opinion on any part of the discussion, then say so in a tactful manner — such as, ‘I defer to to Bob’s opinion, he’s the expert on this,’ ” Mouton says.  5\. Fess Up  If you have nothing to say, you should consider saying that. “If I ask a question and someone doesn’t know the answer, I want them to tell me that they don’t know the answer," says Eric Loyd, CEO of voice over Internet firm Bitnetix. "No technojargon. No doublespeak. No BS.” “Honesty is always the best policy," Loyd says. "Even if the answer is ‘I’m sorry, my mind wandered and I didn’t quite catch the question. Can you repeat it?’ If you tell me something just because you think I want to hear it, or you tell me something that makes no sense just because you wanted to hear yourself speak, then you have no value to my organization and I will give your job to someone else.” (I think we can all agree that you don’t want to BS Eric Loyd!)

 At first glance, accepting a management job can seem like a no-brainer – you have the inside track on what’s going on at the office, you get to delegate tasks and, hopefully, your paycheck gets fatter.

 1\. Do You Want That Much Responsibility?  Leaders may get much of the glory for success, but they also get much of the blame for failure. Are you prepared to handle the stress of budgets and deadlines, to scramble to make things right when one of your charges shows up late or makes a mistake, and to be the one who must find a way to appease a fussy client or an impatient higher-up?  2\. Can You Handle Conflict?  Pete Friedes, former CEO of the international human resource consulting firm Hewitt Associates and co-founder of Managing People Better, notes that people who end up unhappy in management often “can’t stand the conflicts inherent in managing — confronting poor or marginal performers, putting up with all the excuses, trying to meet the various needs of the employees, insisting on excellence and dealing with bad behavior.” If the thought of being the one who fills out performance evaluations, mediates office squabbles, and reads the riot act to underachievers makes you queasy, maybe management isn’t for you.  3\. Do You Prefer To Work On Your Own?  By its nature, managing involves being around others much of the time. An introverted personality or simply a preference for focusing solely on your own  work  may lead to discomfort or discontent as a manager. “Taking a management job when it isn’t a good fit with your personality will most likely result in your losing confidence in yourself and not doing a good job,” Friedes warns. “Accepting an individual role when that is a better fit will be much more likely to achieve job satisfaction and self-confidence.”  4\. Are You Ready To Be Fodder For Water-Cooler Conversation?  Becoming “one of them” can affect how others perceive you, and redefining your office relationships to adjust to the new social structure can be difficult. “When people take a management job, they are really changing careers. But they don’t realize this,” says Alan Vengel, a consultant on workplace issues and author of  Twenty Minutes to a Top Performer  and  The Influence Edge . “All the relationships they’ve had with their colleagues will now be changed. Management considers them part of management and on the management team. Colleagues consider them part of management and no longer part of their team. So, the people you’ve been having lunch with, drinking your coffee with, complaining about the boss with, are no longer accessible to you. You really lose a support group. People look at you and treat you differently.”  5\. How Would The New Position Change Your Life On The Whole?  Lastly, take to heart Vengel’s notion of moving up to management as being a career change. Are you ready for it? How might longer hours, additional stress, and perhaps the need to travel for work affect your family and personal life? Just as if you were considering a new job at a different company, weigh the pros and cons of the management position to see if it is the right move for you.

 For job seekers, the high unemployment rate means it takes more than just the seamless resume and sufficient experience to secure a job. So, how can you increase your chances of landing a job in this tough economy? Answer: Master your job.  Related: #1 Thing You Can Do To Become A Better Employee  Hiring managers are looking for candidates that have mastered their job or established an area of expertise. In addition to the resume and experience, go above and beyond by showing employers that you are dedicated to advancing in your industry by mastering your niche. By demonstrating your mastership, employers can more easily see your worth, and you can even potentially make a stronger case when negotiating your salary. 
 5 Ways To Master your Job  Consider the following five methods of  mastering your job  after hours to stand out from the crowd of candidates:  1\. Invest In Higher Education  Continuing your education in your field shows hiring managers that you are committed to fully mastering your job. In addition, earning your master's degree is likely to bump up your salary in the long run.  2\. Get Certified  Many jobs require using specific software on a day-to-day basis, and earning certifications is a clear indicator to hiring managers that you already have a grip on the knowledge required for the job. For instance, Human Resource specialists should work on getting their Professional in Human Resources (PHR) and Senior Professional in Human Resources (SPHR). Similarly, IT professionals should have software certifications, like Linux, depending on the job. Many colleges have Extension centers that offer courses and exams for professional certifications.  3\. Contribute In The Discourse  Another way to show your mastery is by engaging in blogs, articles, social media, forums, and any other online platforms related to your career, field, or industry. Voluntarily writing guest posts, commenting on articles, and keeping up-to-date on the current trends via company research is a great way to get a leg up on the competition. Getting involved and staying engaged shows that you are enthusiastic about what you do.  4\. Attend Industry Conferences/Events  Become a member of field associations and make the effort to attend events put forth by leading members of your industry. This is a great way to network with other like-minded professionals. Check out public service organizations like ipl2 and association directories like Weddle to research organizations of interest to you.  5\. Map Out A Presentation  Another way to set yourself apart is by preparing a 30-60-90 day plan unique to the company. This wraps up all of the skills you gained from all of the above and directly applies them to your future job. It shows that you've thoroughly researched the company, competitors, as well as the industry, and it shows you have a strong grip on what the company needs to do to succeed in your niche. It's not enough to complete all of the job application requirements. In order to be competitive job seekers, you have to be committed to continue learning in your field, adapting to latest innovations and staying up-to-date in your industry.
