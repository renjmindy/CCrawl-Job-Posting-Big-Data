 Scenario/Problem  : 
 Sometimes users facing an issue in the batch jobs when they delete the batch job in executing state from the back end or for any other reason(like batch job stuck in executing stage). Then they need to perform below steps to resolve the issue. 
 In my case i was facing issue in the workflow batch job and my workflow are not working even after restarting the server or service. 
 Solution  : 
 Perform select query on the below tables with caption filter by typing the keyword of the job you are looking for. 
 Batch and Batchjobs 
 Deleted batchjob has been deleted from Batchjob table but not from Batch table. So, I performed below query and my issue has been resolved. 
 First select query on both tables and then delete query to delete the records.
