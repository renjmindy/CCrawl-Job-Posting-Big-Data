 This pandemic has caused tens of millions of people to lose their jobs. 
 Some of them may come back. Many of them won't. 
 Whether your job is coming back or not, however, you need to make some assumptions for the new world and life that is going to be created because of this time. 
 Fernando Cruz, Managing Partner & Chief Marketing Officer at Legacy Research, rejoins Adam and Naresh to discuss his assumptions, how he was able to rebuild his life after losing everything, and the key to bouncing back when things get hard.
