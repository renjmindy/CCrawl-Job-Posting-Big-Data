 2012: A Year of Lies and Blunders at the DWP Part 1 -> 
 Empty Threats and Tantrums Are All Iain Duncan Smith Has Left In Universal Jobmatch Fiasco 
 Posted on  December 29, 2012  by  johnny void  |  329 Comments 
 Iain Duncan Smith has resorted to increasingly bizarre and empty threats in an effort to defend the shambolic Universal Jobmatch website. 
 The new job seeking website, which has  been plagued by spam, scam and spoof jobs since its launch last month , has the facility for Jobcentre staff to remotely monitor how claimants are using the site. Whilst the DWP is to force everyone on Job Seekers Allowance to register with the site in the New Year, they cannot legally compel claimants to tick the box giving advisors the right to snoop on their activity. 
 This obvious oversight in the construction of the new regime has led to yet more tantrums from Iain Duncan Smith. Speaking to The Metro shortly before Christmas IDS appeared to suggest that claimants who do not allow Jobcentre staff to snoop on their online job seeking activity could  face being hauled into Jobcentres on a daily basis. 
 When Universal Credit is introduced next year 5 million people will be expected to constantly look for 'more or better paid' work as a condition of keeping in-work benefits. Those who are judged not trying hard enough to find jobs may have benefits sanctioned, or be forced into workfare. The enforcement of this job seeking activity is to be 'digital by default' - suggesting that in the near future  part time workers ,  sick or disabled claimants  and  self-employed people forced out of business  due to Universal Credit, will all be required to sign up to Universal Jobmatch. 
 Even if just one in five of those claimants refuse to allow the Jobcentre access to their account, this this would mean around a million people hauled into Jobcentres every day. Currently Jobcentres are running at full capacity, seeing around one and a half million people, mostly once a fortnight. Far from being digital by default, if Iain Duncan Smith's threats are implemented then the launch of Universal Credit will need to recruit tens of thousands of new public sector workers. 
 Since this isn't on the cards anytime soon Iain Duncan Smith's words should be greeted with the mocking contempt they deserve. There is no legal requirement to tick the box granting the Jobcentre the right to snoop on your account and no way that the DWP can force you to accept cookies on a home computer. 
 Of perhaps most concern is Iain Duncan Smith's attempts to threaten claimants with harassment should they exercise their basic legal rights. This is a clear attempt to undermine the principle of equality under the law. If the Secretary of State gets his way then one law for the rich and another for the poor will be firmly enshrined in DWP policy. 
 One person seems to have spotted that the DWP may be monitoring more than just activity on Universal Jobmatch but also attempting to monitor use of other websites. Keep an eye on the following Freedom of Information request: http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/information_returned_from_cookie/new 
 _The Information Commissioner 's Office, who monitor data protection laws,  provide guidance on some of the relevant laws surrounding Universal Jobmatch's use of cookies , the small computer programmes that allow tracking of users activity on the site. _

 @Johnny Void..I seesm to remember someone asking for information using FOI.whether it was compulsory or not to use it, if i remember right..the DWP response…was along the order of..'NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS'..should we assume then that this hissy fit by IDS explains that FOI response?

 "What we encountered, time and time again, has 
not been a preponderance of the long-term 
unemployed, but rather a far more common 
experience of labour market ‘churning’. Our 
interviewees certainly experienced unemployment, 
but importantly and with few exceptions, 
they had also almost always experienced periods 
of being in work. Across a diverse sample 
of men and women and of older and younger 
people, the predominant experience which we 
have found has been one of moving in and out of 
low-paid, short-term jobs, and on and off benefits."

 "Jobs were mostly found through individual 
efforts and personal contacts, but individuals 
were also often keen to access wider support" 
 So then that UJM isnt really helping then is it? IDS…

 The more I hear from this man the more I think he has developed a messianic complex. He seems to think he is still in the Army and the proles can be ordered about like good little soldiers. Well, I have news for him. The last time I looked this was still a free country and people have rights. I appreciate this may not be to the Tories liking but that is tough. He knows this will be a disaster with the losers being the claimants and the taxpayer. Why do people think Cameron wanted to move him at the time of the last re-shuffle until he (IDS) threw teddy out of the pram. Even Cameron knows this will be a disaster.

 "NOT PLAYING BALL" ????"WE HAVE SOME INTERESTING PROGRAMMES LIKE MANDATORY WORK ACTIVITY" 
Hey how about that..how fucking interesting is that? working for fucking nothing??? 
 "For the very small percentage that have a real problem - maybe they have absolutely no skills - we want them in front of the adviser," he said. 
 "And if they're just not playing ball, they will be in front of the adviser. These are little trip wires, if we think they're not applying for it. There are lots of things the adviser can do.” 
 The Work and Pensions Secretary said jobseekers can be hauled in every day if advisers "think they're not up to the activity” they are meant to be doing. 
 “We have some interesting programmes like mandatory work activity if the [advisers] think they're having trouble getting out of bed, if they're not playing the game.”

 I would happily make the sacrifice if it meant putting IDS out of commision believe me. Millions will suffer even worse than they are now under his and Cameron's policies, and I can see riots even worse than 2011 happening sometime in the next year or so.

 I was reading recently IDS is being sidelined and Osborne's taking over. I take this to mean that even Osborne can't face the inevitable calamity introducing UC would bring in. IDS is a fantasist granted some authority to keep the extreme far-right loony section (the part that should be sectioned) of the party in abeyance while the main group got on with the real job of looting the country. I don't think they understood what giving IDS authority would actually mean. Now that they do, they're backpedalling fast. I don't think we'll ever see UC as it's currently envisaged, some stripped-down version maybe but that's all. Anyway, what's wrong with ticking the box to let the DWP have access and then using the Tor browser which grants anonymous browsing, or just logging in through a proxy like hidemyass.com? Nothing for them to see then.

 Agree. I don't think UC will ever happen either, certainly not in the proposed "digital by default" form. 
 As far as UJM goes if you let the DWP access your data the danger comes in several ways if you use the system after logging in, which you have to do in order to apply for many of the jobs on offer. A huge number of interferences don't depend on cookies. First: every job you look at is logged in a database; as is your response, if any, as per why you didn't apply for the job after you look at it. Secondly: if you post a profile UJM will send you details of all kinds of jobs it thinks you could do within a 90 minute journey of your postcode "as the crow flies": many of these jobs will be too far away to get to, or have too few hours to be worth considering, or be too low paid to be helpful etc. Refusing to apply for any of these automated job offers could get you sanctioned. Thirdly: DWP advisors will send you worrisome messages about your CV, covering letters, feedback you get from employers, and activity on UJM and so on and so forth, trying to unsettle you and keep you active on the site; they will also send you details of particular jobs to apply for, which may be good or more likely bad, which, if you refuse could get you sanctioned. No cookies required. Forthly: if you make your CV searchable you will get plagued with invitations by goodness knows what kind of employer to interviews, possibly impossibly far away, for mostly crap jobs which you wouldn't want to consider off your own bat. 
 The only safe way to use UJM is not to make a profile and never to log in when making searches. This will restrict you to employers who post their details on UJM for all to see, publicly, but at least these people are likely to be bona fide. If you make a profile and allow the DWP to monitor your activity, cookies or no cookies, they've got you by the balls.

 Fuck IDS and Universal Jobmatch! 
 I will never agree voluntarily to be surveiled by the DWP while perusing vacancies on Universal Jobmatch. I would much rather visit the Jobcentre every day and present myself to the low level clerks behind the counter than sign away my right to keep my personal data private. (Although this would be bad news for people living a long way away from their local Jobcentre if their travelling expenses weren't reimbursed. Surely even the Jobcentre wouldn't make people on Jobseeker's Allowance have to fork out their own money, on a daily basis, in order to make repeated unnecessary visits?) What an absolute arsehole IDS is to try to strong arm and bully people into signing away rights already granted to them within the EU. It really is almost beyond belief: 
 (1) They are evasive and economical with the truth about our rights and responsibilities, not explicitly stating what we can and cannot be mandated to do clearly and understandably; 
 (2)They try to persuade us to abandon rights in respect to our privacy that are already ours and have been for many years, sometimes even lying t us or threatening us with not existent penalties if we don't give in to their half-truths and untruths; 
 (3)They threaten to make life unbearable for us if we don't toe the line by hauling us into Jobcentres on a daily basis and I bet make us do repeated spells of workfare and similar, trying to wear us down until we abandon our right to privacy and put ourselves on permanent Big Brother-like scrutiny so that they can jerk our chains and try to trip us up and sanction us remotely. 
 Shit! The DWP is getting more and more like the Mafia as the days go by. If you don't do what they tell you they "lean" on you until you submit. This IDS character isn't right in the head is he? I'm serious. The bloke is sounding more and more like a basket case as the days go by. No wonder Cameron wanted to move him to another post. 
 Well I say: Let the fuckers try! I will never submit to coercion like that.

 and now a message sponsored by MASTERCARD. 
"Mr Duncan Smith also confirmed his department is looking at introducing a ‘welfare card’, instead of some benefits, for drug addicts. This could only be used to purchase certain items, such as food and other essentials, stopping them from spending their benefits on drugs. 
 “I’ve been looking at this process to figure out whether it’s feasible, how would it work, how does it match with legal obligations, so we’ve already been examining this," he told the BBC's World at One. "There’s nothing at the moment on plans, but I genuinely think there are some areas where we might want to think about. 
 “You know, somebody who has a history of real drug addiction, giving people cash sometimes can actually lead to further problems.” 
 "YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO HAS A BENEFIT SCROUNGING PROBLEM LIKE GETTING THE TAX PAYER TO PAY FOR HIS WIFE AND HIS SECOND HOME AND ALL THE OTHER PERKS giving people cash sometimes can actually lead to further problems.”

 HERES SOME INFORMATION ABOUT TORIES HELPING PEOPLE FIND JOBS: 
 http://tompride.wordpress.com/2012/12/27/firm-paid-73m-to-find-work-for-unemployed-has-exactly-one-apprenticeship-vacancy-for-the-whole-uk/ 
 "A firm which was set up by two Tory donors and won contracts worth £73m from the coalition government to find work for unemployed people has exactly one advertisement for apprenticeships on its website. 
 Just one. For the whole of the UK. 
 ESG (employment and skills group) has a section on its website for vacancies. On it there is just a single vacancy for the whole of the UK – for a ‘salon assistant’ at a hairdresser’s in the north west. 
 There are no vacancies at all for any of the other regions of the country – including London and the whole of Scotland: 
 You can have a look at the website for yourself here. 
 And you can read the whole sleazy story of ESG and the Tory donors here. 
 Actually – to be honest – there are a couple of other jobs advertised elsewhere on ESG’s website. Jobs working for ESG itself. 
 Not surprising really as they must have plenty of taxpayers’ money left over from their £73m to spend on salaries for their own staff. 
 Mind you, this question does rather spring to mind: 
 How many staff do you need to help you keep track of just one vacancy?"

 Not sure this story is very helpful. The money quoted isn't just to provide apprenticeships, they also run Work Programme and MWA contracts which don't include apprenticeships as well as NVQ programmes. There's also no reason why any apprenticeships would be advertised on their website if they are filling placements. I've no doubt their performance figures are as dreadful as all the other WP providers and they are complete scum, but it doesn't help to muddy the waters by misunderstanding what exactly they are supposed to be doing.

Everything I wrote is true. If it wasn’t – you can be sure ESG will be more than ready to sue me. They are big enough and daft enough to look after themselves and don’t need people like you to defend them. 
There is one job advertised for an apprentice in the whole of the UK on the ESG website. That’s a fact. 
Stop being so easy on them Johnny. ESG got at least 73 million quid of our money. Your expectations of these workfare Tory-donating firms should be higher.

 I'm not giving them an easy ride, I'm sure if you did your homework then you'd find they are filthy. But the implications you draw from the fact they only advertise one apprenticeship are nonsense, do they even have a current contract to deliver apprentices, how much is it worth, do they advertise elsewhere, does it just mean they haven't updated the website over xmas etc? 
 By setting up things which are easy to demolish then you risk undermining any further investigation, just as paedogate was undermined by people making baseless allegations with no evidence - this kind of stuff doesn't help.

 @scarecrow78 Sumptuary laws (from Latin sumptuariae leges) are laws that attempt to regulate habits of consumption. Black's Law Dictionary defines them as "Laws made for the purpose of restraining luxury or extravagance, particularly against inordinate expenditures in the matter of apparel, food, furniture, etc."[1] Traditionally, they were laws that regulated and reinforced social hierarchies and morals through restrictions on clothing, food, and luxury expenditures. 
 Throughout history, societies have used sumptuary laws for a variety of purposes. They attempted to regulate the balance of trade by limiting the market for expensive imported goods. They were also an easy way to identify social rank and privilege and often were used for social discrimination.[2] 
 This frequently meant preventing commoners from imitating the appearance of aristocrats and sometimes also to stigmatize disfavored groups. In the Late Middle Ages, sumptuary laws were instituted as a way for the nobility to cap the conspicuous consumption of the prosperous bourgeoisie of medieval cities, and they continued to be used for these purposes well into the 17th century.[2] 
 this actually happened at the turn of the century whereby they passed a law whereby servants could not wear clothing that looked similar to their masters….

 That sounds very much like the proposed benefits card doesn't it? All the lurid headlines and stories about benefits being spent on "luxuries" has been a popular tabloid trope for years now, and these cards if implemented will do just that. They will also have the effect of seperating claimants from the rest of society, imposing particular limits on their economic and spending habits, and may well result in an increase in social discrimination against claimants, as has already been experienced by disabled people throughout history.

 I'm sure Tesco are rubbing their hands in glee, probably even planning on setting up scrounger card checkouts, where some jumped-up little fascist can scrutinize every single item in your trolley, taking great delight in telling you what you can & can't have.

 This fucking says it all (from that Metro article): "The site has been running for three weeks and already has 690,000 job seekers, 370,000 employer accounts and more than 230,000 jobs." So, assuming all these jobs are real, which they're not, there's one job advert for every three people already registered on the site, not counting the millions on benefits who haven't been bullied into signing up yet, and yet somehow we're all meant to get a job out of the 230,000 on offer? I knew IDS said that if we don't get jobs out of signing up then it meant we lacked imagination, I wonder if he means we're meant to imagine jobs that don't fucking exist?

 That Claim of 370,000 Employer accounts on Universal Jobmatch is utter nonsense. According to the public reports on it there are 43154 active employers on it as at 28/12/2012. 
 The number of active employers on 19/11/2012 at go live was 44156. 
 The peak number of active employers on it was 05/12/2012 at 54069. 
 So there are LESS active employers on it currently than when it went live. 
There are 20% LESS active employers on it than at its peak. 
 Enough said I think 😀

 Ian Duncan Smith thinks we don't have imagination if we don't get a job? 
It is the fact his UJM computer is an old crock of shite. 
It only lets you list 3 'skills', and it picks which are eligible to be listed. Then it sends tons of irrelevant jobs, supposedly based on the skill listed, which are nothing to do with it. None, usually, are anywhere near you. None are in any field you are qualified to work. Many don't exist; and a lot can be for the opposite sex of applicant. Or they have things automatically barring you, such as 'must be a driver' when you're not. 
If (as in my case) UJM's site isn't working, it doesn't even let you apply! Then it emails you to ask why you didn't apply. There is no option for 'I tried to apply but pressing Apply, when there is a button for it, it crashes the whole computer/site.' Or an option for 'Because this site is complete crap.'

Your Footmen are a proclamation of your wealth and prestige. They are representatives of your Household and Family and as such it is advantageous that you develop a good relationship. However, as Lower Servants, they do not expect to be addressed outside the receipt of instructions. 
While the Housemaids will clean the House during the day, they should make every care and attention never to be observed by you doing their duties. If by chance you do meet, you should expect them to "give way" to you by standing still and averting their gaze, whilst you walk past, leaving them un-noticed. By not acknowledging them, you will spare them the shame of explaining their presence.

 If we allow them to bully us into allowing them to put us under surveillance, they will reward us for our compliance and demonstrating our commitment to finding work, with measures like indefinite workfare and time-limiting JSA and housing benefit. The punishments the Jobcentre will inflict on us for not giving them permission to put us under digital surveillance, are exactly what they will inflict on us anyway (and much worse in the future) if we do. If we don't resist now, they will destroy us in the end anyway. I'm willing to take a chance and endure the sanctions and harassment to resist and hold on to my rights.

 Exactly. I do not have a UJ account yet (to be fair my JC has been quite lenient on that score so far) but I will only create an account when it is impossible to avoid doing so without being sanctioned. And I will NOT under any circumstances allow access to my UJ account by the JC, and I would rather be sanctioned than allow a Government agency to remotely monitor my daily activities. (Orwell's Big Brother is well and truly with us huh?)

 "The evaluation is structured around a series of inter-related themes which will seek to explore the extent to which Universal Credit has realised the benefits set out in the White Paper1 and the subsequent Impact Assessments2. The evaluation will draw on existing information sources as far as possible. If no suitable data source exists, the Department will consider commissioning quantitative and/or qualitative new research of individuals, staff and stakeholders including employers. This will be reviewed on a case by case basis to ensure value for money for th 
This evaluation sits within a wider programme of analysis on Welfare Reform. Whilst not directly addressing related areas of the Welfare Reform Act 2012, the evaluation will need to be aware of closely related areas of policy that may impact on evidence, these include PIP/DLA changes, the Benefit Cap; direct payments of housing benefit, changes to Council Tax, Social Fund and Crisis Loans and under-occupancy of social housing."

 Even in the Torygraph it mentions breaking EU Law about monitoring.. 
 "The tracking element of the programme will not be compulsory as monitoring people's behaviour online without their consent would not be allowed under EU law. 
 But job advisers are able to impose sanctions such as compulsory work placements or ultimately losing benefits if they feel the unemployed are not searching hard enough. " 
 i think what bothers me is the fact that DWP refused on the grounds of 'not in the public interest' whether to state clearly that signing on the UJM was compulsory or not"… 
 and that was using the FOI request too…

 The Claim of 370,000 Employer accounts on Universal Jobmatch is utter nonsense. According to the public reports on it there are 43154 active employers on it as at 28/12/2012. 
 The number of active employers on 19/11/2012 at go live was 44156. 
 The peak number of active employers on it was 05/12/2012 at 54069. 
 So there are LESS active employers on it currently than when it went live. 
There are 20% LESS active employers on it than at its peak. 
 Enough said I think 😀

 Good news and long may that continue! If the number of employers using UJ continues to fall the whole system will become unworkable. Employers aren't stupid, and if they think the system is useless they will not use it.

requirement by the way it is designed, is this true?

 I suspect that it's highly unlikely that employers will be 'forced' to use Universal Jobmatch as most of them will be only too aware of how bad it is, and that if it's compulsory for them to use it as well as us the unemployed they would soon be inundated by mass applications from people totally unsuited for the job, leading to increased costs in dealing with applications, actually finding the suitable applicants. The whole system is a logistical nightmare that puts the whole ID card fiasco into the shade. Mass databases may be somewhat viable it they are for restricted access, but those databases where virtually everyone and his/her dog has access are extremely vulnerable due to human error/laxity not to mention that, in my experience, multi-purpose databases using parameters that are variable according to the differing needs of the involved agencies are a nightmare as they are so complex and rarely do what they purport to do, can be exceedingly slow to access, and frequently crash. Both UJ and UC have fundamental flaws that will probably make them completely unworkable, in the case of UJ it is a) a British Government IT project (who have such a brilliant track record in delivering, on time, and under budget) basing a system on an already discredited company's system - not a recipe for success, and due to it's unpopularity, has become a target for hackers, those posting spoof jobs, or those merely out to phish. UK Government may pride itself on the calibre of it's anti-hacking staff at GCHQ (who are recruiting at the moment, wanna job?), but seemingly failing to realise that there are enough hackers with a conscience out there who are at least equally skilled. UC will eventually also probably fail when it finally dawns on the majority of the population that they have been signed up unwittingly to a mass observation system that has implications far deeper than any ID card scheme. It will be a bureaucratic nightmare to administer, with all those who are in part-time work that pays below an arbitrary threshold expected to seek out more or better paying work, and with the sanctions involving loss of both income and housing payments will create chaos like we've never seen. This is especially so as there just aren't the jobs out there, and for all IDS's hyperbole about immigrants taking jobs, the fact of the matter is that a lot of the lower paid jobs will be filled by people forced into them on the Work Programme. 
 I think most of use would be in agreement that there are severe structural problems in the UK's economy, too reliant on the service sector which produces little wealth for anyone but the already super rich, that doesn't seek to invest in the working population through the implementation of a seriously rigorous and well funded training programme geared to a rational plan for economic development. There is no way in the world that the UK's workforce can compete in the same economic spheres as China and India. UK governments need to learn the lessons of countries like France and Germany where they have steadfastly held on to their manufacturing sectors, investing in hi tec industries and technologies. 
 I think we need to start thinking about setting our own agendas instead of just reacting to the policies imposed upon us. It needs to be our own response, as ourselves as we aren't exactly hearing a whole lot of opposition to these policies from the Labour Party, or indeed the mainstream trade unions, who seem, by and large to have just buried their collective heads in the sand, hoping the nightmare will be over when they finally pull them out again. Any attempt on our part to present a viable alternative will take a lot of work, and a lot of time, and certainly at this early stage will be extremely frustrating as any efforts we expend will seem very much like pissing in the wind, as those who would benefit, and who could also become involved will, at the moment have buried their heads in the sand and hope that this is all a nightmare. Move us on in time some eighteen months, or two years and Universal Credit in place and the situation will be very different; then many people will be looking for support and advice, which is why those of us with at least an inkling, (for that is all we have at the moment) really need to start to talk about possibilities. 
 Let's not descend into the usual Left-Wing bickering amongst ourselves, that's exactly what these bastards want us to do. But I would suggest caution if and when we get ourselves involved with statist groups, as inevitable those ideas would just end up in exactly the same situation as we now find ourselves. Let's all agree that we are in this because we are part of a culture of resistance to the crypto-fascist agendas of both the Tories and New Labour. 
 Of course, it's imperative that we focus on our immediate situation and oppose the undermining of the welfare system at this point in time that threatens to plunge so many of us into abject need and homlessness, but long term we need to think creating our own systems of support, systems that can't be taken away from us. It's a huge task, but do we really have an alternative? It's also beyond the wit of any one person to come up with ideas that are workable, but we all have an idea of the kind of society we would like to see, so let's talk about it.

 We need to have our councils, who we can elect and pretty much keep an eye on as they're local, use their funds, council tax and so on, to create local banks. They can 'lend' into their communities far more than the amount they actually have, that's how banks work, fraudulently. Interest on these 'loans' will go back to the local communities and act as the base for further 'loans' or be spent into the community on whatever. That'll put money back into the communities the government are taking monies from. If the communities also create local currencies and swap their pounds for local pounds a la Bristo Pound, that'll stop money from leaving the community. There's the basic premise.

 @sibrydionmawr: 
You have another possible option? 
Apply for all the mcjobs they tell you to apply for in England. 
 Apply in Welsh. 
 
 This works equally well in Gujarati, Yiddish, and Klingon. 
They can never accuse you of not applying. Any language they won't know, basically. So if they are in Wales and speak Welsh, then send them a video in BSL or a printout of Braille. 
 Another thing you can try: say you are spending a year's sabbatical studying Native American issues, and for the duration of the year you will be communicating to the jobcentre only by hand signs, and to the employers only by smoke signals. 
"IDS you said be creative and imaginative, so I did. I thought outside the box. I sent my job application on a channel of positive thoughts and cosmic energy.They'll get it if they have a compatible mindset." 
 If they get really tricky with you, you could try quipu, the Quechua system of messages in knotted string.

 Anyone who thinks the government will not push ahead and try to implement Universal Credit for claimants is a bloody fool. 
 Your favourite four-letter-acronym organisation, based outside the UK and minimising their tax contributions for workfare, is already running the trial. No, not as-yet targetting the unemployed; ATOS run the most inept financial system ever for asylum seekers. Cash? Not-on-your-life, mate! Let's give them a Fisher-Price bank card which only supermarkets like Tesco participate in and make sure when they're double-charged it can take six months to get a refund. 
 I won't even resort to the phrase "slippery slope"when it comes to Universal Credit being turned into the same. The right-wing press, and the right-wing-nuts, are already salivating at stopping the unemployed having any alcohol or tobacco. 
 In parallel, they're looking at how to turn the screw on the working poor. That is, the working poor who qualify for some benefits. The language of news reports, and reading-between-the-lines, is that people should be kicking and fighting their way up the wage ladder  or risk losing supportive benefits . Private landlord taking obscene amounts and making you qualify for housing benefit? Your fault if you don't find a better-paid job. 
 For at least 30 years, the approach of the DWP has been, at least slightly, right-wing. Cuts, retirements, targets, and a 'hostile environment' are now working overtime to get rid of staff who might view any unemployment benefit as a right rather than a privilege. To put things as-simplistically as Tory propaganda in the Telegraph and Times: The unemployed are guilty, the DWP's job is to find ways to stop paying them. Yes, that includes people who have paid into the system for 20-30 years, at well-above-average rates, would be perfectly qualified to manage an entire region's branches of any supermarket chain, but the DWP assumes they're workshy because stacking shelves in any of said supermarket chains might seem demeaning. 
 I'm currently pursuing a range of FoIA requests against the DWP. Happy to share the ongoing results with you 'under embargo', Johnny. I've forced written apolgies out of DWP offices, had MPs eagerly offer to take up cases of incompetence, and keep finding the DWP inept, useless and secretive. The biggest problem is right-wing press such as the Daily Mail spewing fawning adulation in response to IDS and others threatening the human rights of the unemployed. 
 If the help to prosecute is there, I want the European courts telling IDS that he is "naught but a Nazi apologist" running his "Workfare makes you free" programmes.

 I don't think Universal Credit will fail because the government gives up on it but because it's technically impossible to run a system of that complexity with tax and benefits fully integrated and able to be managed and updated by users, employers, councils, DWP and HRMC staff, in real time, over the public internet. It is and can only be a right fuck up!

 If certain shops won't sell to people with prepaid benefits cards; 
If people on the dole are forced to do workfare; 
Then conceivably you could end up on workfare stacking the shelves of a shop your card is not valid for you to shop at yourself.

 As anyone in the know, who has experience of either E-roof or Sprint, (database systems allegedly designed to track people designated as homeless) will know, massive databases used by differing organisations for slightly different purposes in a related field are nightmarishly complex to both use and administer.

 @Brian McNeil i really belive its organised like a system..use the hate rhetoric to drive as much fucking public money inthe offshore bank accounts for the tory donors..and the othe scumbags..the reason i say that is due to the fact that the DWP have cut fraud investigating staff ie the fraud investigators checking out the work prog scam industry…that cant be by accident.

 @Brian McNeil yeah ok…in fact i came across something really simple as it drove a coach and horses straight through the strivers/skivers malarky.. 
it goes back to something that happned earlier this year.. 
an activist from RIGHT TO WORK campaign was protesting against workfare..ok? up comes mrs fucking Tory bigot and said the police should arrest the guy..another Tory MP said the shops that were using workfare were 'spineless' beacuse they caved in to the protest.. 
the ms then it was omitted from the daily HEIL that ms tory bigot had produced a book claiming that ALL BRITISH WORKERS WERE LAZY.. 
so if you deconstaruct all that you get: 
a RIGHT TO WORK (but please pay us) guy who should have beeen arrested..and against that a fucking TOry saying these shops business have the fucking right to get people to work for them for NOTHING.. whilst the other tory twat was calling all british workers 'bone idle' 
which then makes the skiver/striver thing look all arse about tit so to speak.

 "Section 35 (formulation of government policy etc) 
 The policy in relation to Universal Jobmatch is still being developed and until finalised, the 
Department considers that the balance of public interest weighs in favour of non-disclosure. 
This is because the Act acknowledges that good government depends on good decision 
making and therefore needs space in which to formulate policies based on the best advice 
available with full consideration of all the options. Ministers also need to be able to conduct 
rigorous and candid risk assessments of their policies and programmes including 
considerations of the pros and cons without there being premature disclosure which might 
close off other, better options. " 
 SORRY USING THAT ARGUMNET YOU CANT CRITICISE ANYTHING… 
 including 'GOOD GOVT' are they serious?? 'premature disclosure..ok so GAGGING ORDER? YES? 
what better options? how about abetter option like scrapping the fucking thing??f 
ffs there wasnt even hardly any proper consultation on the UJM…justa poxy document..

 He's already very plainly a self-deluded bully - but I'm wondering how close IDS is coming on to having a fully fledged nervous breakdown as more and more of his idiotic welfare reform plans start to unravel over the next few months? I can see him chewing the carpet by the summer before being carried out of Parliament screaming profanities in a straight jacket at the start of next autumn.

 I agree. I think we can already see a progression in his behaviour, from lying on his CV (the facts of which seem to be well established) to his present day behaviour. I remember a year or or back, probably the clip's still available, he told a lie in the House which caused even Grayling, a man perhaps not noted for his shining integrity, who was sitting next to IDS to visibly start and stare at him. Since then, among others, we've had the ludicrous spectacle of IDS on the BBC News assuring us no taxpayer money was at risk in the Work Programme as it was, and he was specific here, a payment by results-only programme, this amid well-informed and authoritative reports in the media of the hundreds of millions of pounds already being spent on the scheme as attachment fees. In my view, we're already seeing IDS having a breakdown and we have been for some time.

 I hope to see both him and his mentally-retarded 'superior' Cameron act the same way. Let's face it, BOTH of these grade-A arseholes are frankly mentally unstable (CaMORON refuses point blank to admit to using cannabis at Eton but we all know in our heart of hearts he used it) and need sectioning such is their hatred for anyone who is unemployed. If I were a violent man, I would punch Cameron in the gob because the stuck-up and snooty MORON needs a good sucker punch.

 The Current confirmed 'Job' advert count I have of Kleeneze Independent Distributors on Universal Jobmatch not upfront who they are and in any case in breach of parts of the UJM T&C section 10.3 is 2389. 
This breaks down as : 
 'Focus Group Distribution' : 118 
'Infocus Group' : 287 
'Salian Group' : 1089 
'Vision Focus Group' : 779 
'Orion partnership' : 31 
'Freedom Enterpirses' : 53 
'Focus Group' : 23 
'G & D Marketing' : 9 
 Several of these 'Companies' were adding more 'Job' Adverts today. See my tweets earlier today for futher detail. 
 'G&D Marketing' & 'Freedom Enterprises' is the same Kleeneze Distributor BTW. 
 This figure will increase to about 2600 once I confirm the lastest example of this practice by some Kleeneze Distributors I have found. 
 I am aware someone informed the DWP about this situation about 14th December and they have done NOTHING about it to date. 
 Says it all I think 😀

 Yes of course, it's all the fault of black people and Asians. They're entirely to blame for everything everywhere. "The eternal Jew, the wandering Jew….poisoning our Aryan race…" And while you're at it, kick out anyone Polish, even though Poland has plenty of your skinhead-and-swastika buddies. Romany and Traveller, get rid of them too. And anyone mixed-race. 
Clean up our country even further, by insisting we all go back where we came from. Cause that will make a nice white Britain for the British, right? 
What were we doing letting French Protestants, German wool merchants and Dutch drainage engineers come over here? What were we thinking when we hired Irishmen to make our roads, railways and canals, buildings and parks? It's looking a little cleaner now. 
Send back every imported monarch since Aethelstan. (=all of them). Right, so we have to be a republic, but on the plus side it's getting cleaner all the time. Oh and stop serving up all that foreign muck that passes for food. 
No more potatoes, ketchup, rabbits, curry, tea, coffee, chocolate, sugar. And definitely no sweetcorn, wine, icecream,turkey, chicken (a junglefowl from India), or chewing gum. Oh and most other food. 
We can quit already, wearing the traitors' fabrics: anything cotton has to go. We should live in skins really. Of course it'll be a wrench getting rid of cars, digital watches, electricity, paper, decimals and most other inventions. 
But we'll adjust. 
Those sneaky Normans, they're for the chop next. Coming over here with their churches and something resembling proper toilets. A bucket and a dungheap is good enough for us Brits. We'll have to ditch most of the English language and stop calling it English. And Christianity too of course, making us have to become pagan or atheist. Since we kicked out or massacred the Jews (killing them in the tower in York was a stroke of genius. It saved us the cost of deporting them), we've had to do all that money-lending stuff ourselves - which is why our banks are not so good; but a few people get really rich, so should be rewarded for being rich, by being made even richer. However banks are an introduction so we have to lose those. Let's just swap pebbles. We don't like anyone Scandinavian so those Vikings can hop it, along with their writing system and literature. And we don't like Germans, so all Saxons should leave. So we can drop Anglo-Saxon. We don't want Roman blood muddying the waters. Or all the Semitic, African, Slavic, Asian and Germanic soldiers that came over in the Roman army and its associated camp followers, suppliers and merchants. Most of the Roman army was non-Roman. In losing the Roman civilisation we must wave goodbye to swimming pools, underfloor heating, the weekdays, public toilets, our writing system, arches, four-yearly games, the months, the calendar, ludo, a form of sauna, centralised government and taxation, and blocks of flats (insulae). And we abandon the republic too, the one we got by dumping the monarchy, as the whole concept of 'res publica' is Roman. Most legal and medical vocabulary comes from Latin, medical terms also come from Greek. French has also given us a lot of words. And if we're down at the beach we can forget about wearing sandals, those are more filthy Roman products! Of course bikinis are out, because breast-bands were developed by the ancient Greeks of the Minoan civilisation, to enable normally-nude female athletes to do the bull-leaping while keeping their chest in one place. And Bikini is an island in the Pacific. Swimming costumes are foreign too, the correct British way to go swimming was to be male and naked. To really be British, we have to be Celtic. Traditional British army clothes: a torc around the neck, and no clothes, and the skin painted blue with woad, the hair plastered with lime. Like the samurai of Japan had, a Celtic warrior often had a separate sword or knife with which he was meant to kill himself if faced with hopeless defeat. If you were a woman or girl, let's just say life would involve a lot of weaving (but no cotton). 
But, oops, the Celts came from central Europe. And, before, that from India. (As did the Baltic peoples, Germanic and Romance tribes, Greeks, Slavs, Romany nation, Armenians and Albanians. That is why they are called Indo-Europeans, and why Irish is in the same family as Hindi and Swedish.) It starts to get more complicated, because all their ancestors came from Africa. And during the ice age there was nobody in Britain at all. (Living on top of, or possibly under, miles of ice, for some reason, did not appeal.) Even when people roamed the ice, we used a foul foreign invention that was first thought up elsewhere: fire, and the use of fire to cook food and make pots. So ditch that. Get used to eating raw meat and carrying everything in animal skins. In India the ancestors of the Celts were not from there; so…We will have to….go back to Africa! Which makes us…. black Africans! 
Before that we were ape-men, and those came from little shrews that survived the extinction of the dinosaurs. Mammals came from reptiles, and reptiles from amphibians. Back into the sea; before fish and urchins, there were sponges. We all have to trace ourself back to one single amoeba. (=computing power of entire Tory think-tank) 
We were bacterial colonies of stromatolites, and at the very beginning we were short chains of amino-acids. Now we look like all sort of the same thing. There's no black and no white any more, and before that no life at all, unless you count the birth of the planets, stars and universe 
(at which point, does the external covering's coloration, on a rather insignificant carbon-based lifeform, still matter?). 
 Maybe another short exercise in imagination? 
'Deporting my friend and his kids'. 
We're back in 21st century Britain. The government adopts a 'Send 'em back where they came from' policy. It has to be followed to the letter. It soon becomes apparent that there are problems with the policy. But zealous officials press ahead with enforcing it anyway. Firstly, the children's mother is put on a plane to Japan. Fair enough, you might think. But then the father has to be deported to where he is from. So 50% of the father is deported to Egypt and 50% to the Celtic nations, achievable probably with a chainsaw. Regrettably, this renders him nonviable. Their three children, two girls and a boy, each need deporting to 3 places: 50% to Japan, 25% to Egypt, and 25% to the Celtic nations. 
 At one stage a few years ago the BNP had an online shop. I don't really have a high level of familiarity with the full range of their merchandise, but I wonder if they sell giant posters of Simon Darby and Nick Griffin. Possibly excellent and appropriate presents for one who shares their beliefs. Sending them back, as Darby advocates, is a perfect idea. Perfect, so long as he and Griffin are the first to submit themselves to DNA testing followed by a swift proportional repatriation by chainsaw. 
 Fascism and racism and xenophobia, have no rightful place in society. 
Whatever colour our skin, our blood is red. Without light there is no colour, so colour itself is meaningless in darkness. Immigrants enrich society.

 Deny vote has already been noted. 
The smartcard follows you tells you where to go what to buy what not to. Buy. 
 Who needs advertising ? Controlling consumer choice. 
I am sure Tesco will cash in on this with special offers as the smartcard or scrounger card will stigmatise you .

 Denial of the vote to the unemployed was suggested in the Telegraph blogs in 2011. I wouldn't be surprised if this idea was suggested again.

 Taking away the vote depicting jobless as idle sanctioning them does not make jobs suddenly appear. Most ppl are in and out of jobs. Besides on the subject. Of voting and democracy its the lobbying industry that's running the show that govt listens to not us plebs

 I think IDS's mission IS to see as many sick, disabled, unemployed and working poor "resting in peace", and the implementation of UJ and UC is a part of that process. That's why I hope employers continue to snub UJ, and the IT delivery of UC is a complete cock up. If thousands more people aren't to be made homeless IDS needs to go ASAP, and I think it'll take an almighty balls-up to make that happen. So fingers crossed. 🙂

 employers dont directly use UJM, like with many job sites they will advertise 
a vacancy with a few websites, UJM just pulls these details off other websites and dumps them onto UJM. so if you find a job on lets say reed.co.uk. and you apply and then find that UJM has a match for you just select I have already applied for this job from the drop down list.

 Evidence from reports on Universal Jobmatch is employers are not using it. In summary : 
 Active Employers 19/11/2012 : 44156 Go Live whatever DWP Claim 😀 
Active Employers 05/12/2012 : 54069 Peak number of Active employers 
Active Employers 29/12/2012 : 42220 Latest Available Figure 
 Currently 4.38% LESS Active employers than when it went live. 
Currently 21.9% LESS Active employers than at the peak. 
 So perhaps DWP can explain where the claimed figure of 370,000 employer accounts on Universal Jobmatch before Christmas came from ? 😀

 Sterling work you’re doing in exposing how easily Univarsehole Jobseekersnitch can be abused by those claiming to be employers when, in reality, they’re nothing of the sort. 
 Now that damn fool Iain Duncan Smith has come out and admitted that the site will be used to spy on jobseeker activity and trigger DWP ‘interventions’. A cabinet minister states that a government website has been specifically designed to ‘trip up’ benefit claimants who will be obliged to use it. Oo-er.

 Employers hate UJM because they get bombarded with loads of blag and unsuitable applications which claimants have been mandated to make by DWP. 
I am convinced IDS is some form of sociopath, the way he insisted on keeping his DWP position in the reshuffle, the sheer spite and venom whic h come out of his petulant little mouth every time the subject of jobseekers comes up. He is a spitter and a snarler with his own distorted world view, he appears very short tempered and just cannot take fair comment or criticism in an adult way. He is ideologically motivated and heavily influenced by U.S Workfare/insurance giants UNUM. 
He's got absolutely NO MANDATE to inflict this shite on people and drag us all back to the workhouse. IDS is The Beadle.

 For those wanting to take action in the New Year, please watch and share this new video: 
 I notice an interesting use of language here: 
 http://consent.me.uk/universaljobmatch/mandatory/ 
 See: 
 The JSAg: 
"…section of my my Universal Jobmatch account  if  I have one." 
 The DWP letter: 
A10 "… claimants  may be  required to create a profile and CV in Universal Jobmatch…" 
 Despite the tough talk I'm not convinced so far that compulsory has moved beyond meaning the issuing of Jobseeker's Directions, and re-written agreements (where being obliged to register is made as provision under the Other Activities section of the agreement.) 
 My question is: which job seekers formally fall under a criteria - and what is this!? - where they are asked/required to register?

 if the JC+ are running at full capacity seeing people every fortnight then they should be running at 50% capacity when they may only have to see them once a month as UC will be a monthly payment so that will leave them 50% to call claimants in every day. 
I can see it now people will claim they have no access to the internet and if that is the case IMO that could be enough to throw the spanner in the works of the jobmatch BS that IDS wants.

 The staff answering the phones seem to have been given orders to try and get people to use the internet. First question is "Have you heard of Universal Jobmatch"? Second question: "Do you want to sign up?" Some use their anonymity to give lectures about how claimants should be spending 35 hours a week looking for work and telling them that their local jobcentres should be changing the terms of their agreements.

 PS If we ARE obliged to sign up to Universal Jobmatch, how bout stating "privacy concerns" as the reason for not following up anonymised "vacancies". Armed with info from this blog, being hauled up before an advisor to explain that could be a pleasure.

 Bob, 
We are definitely in agreement that the Tories are shovelling public money into the coffers of the capitalists with no real benefit to the unemployed, whilst characterising us as workshy scum.

"I’m sure if you did your homework then you’d find they are filthy. But the implications you draw from the fact they only advertise one apprenticeship are nonsense, do they even have a current contract to deliver apprentices" (Johnny Void at 5.56pm 29 Dec).

 The point here was simply that (unlike you!) I'm not very adept with digital media and posted my comment at the wrong place in the thread. 
 I referred to the card file to remind that there was a time when the unemployed would queue once a week, declare they had not had work, and a government employee would actually try ,with no questions about "Jobsearch", or any expectation or implication that the person before them might rather not work, to find something suitable for them; and failing that, would arrange for a small cheque to be in their hand within a few minutes. That's how I remember it anyway. 
 Something I've not seen mentioned here (and apologies if it has) is the fact that UC will only, or at least mainly, be claimable via the internet, a barrier that may seem far more significant for those who don't have, eg your skills and resources

 So, If they dont think i am doing enough to find work, they will ask me to go into town every day at a cost of £5 a day. Which no doubt i will have to find myself no reimbursement. so thats a 3rd of my giro gone. Luckily i live at home with my elderly mother in her own house. So they will call you in every day how are they to know you are doing to jobsearch.. by sitting you in the job centre. What if you are on the MWA and you are still mandated to go every day who takes precedence. I think IDS is losing it, all the signs are he is going to have a severe breakdown

Active Employers 30/12/2012 : 41298 Latest Available Figure 
 Currently 6.47% LESS Active employers than when it went live. 
Currently 23.6% LESS Active employers than at the peak.

 And in the last 7 days, 7953 jobs nationally 
 In the last 14 days, 28,787 jobs nationally. 
 Ths doesn't take into account the number of non-jobs,ones that have been reposted and agencies fishing for CVs. 
 With over 2.5 million unemployed it doesn't look as if it's going to be the most successful system for helping the unemployed. 
 Employers are obviously going to be wary of it as they're just going to get hundreds of applications from people who lack the necessary skills, are over-qualified and not interested in the job in the first place as they have been forced to apply. 
 Keep the figures coming Dave. You're doing great work on Twitter, especially as the DWP seem to be increasing their presence(propaganda) on it. 
 If it wasn't for people like you and Johnny, the public wouldn't be getting the information they need.

 The Current confirmed ‘Job’ advert count I have of Kleeneze Independent Distributors on Universal Jobmatch not upfront who they are and in any case in breach of parts of the UJM T&C section 10.3 is 2496 as at 13:17 31/12/2012 
 This breaks down as : 
 Focus Group Distribution : 118 
Infocus Group : 313 26 Added since 30/12 
Salian Group : 1125 26 added since 30/12 
Vision Focus Group : 821 
Orion partnership : 30 
Freedom Enterpirses : 53 
Focus Group : 20 
G & D Marketing : 10 1 added since 30/12 
Jam Group : 6 
 ‘G&D Marketing’ & ‘Freedom Enterprises’ is the same Kleeneze Distributor BTW. 
 This figure will increase to about 2700 once I confirm the latest example of this practice by some Kleeneze Distributors I have found. It is taking longer than expected due to the complexity of case. 
 I am aware someone informed the DWP about this situation about 14th December and they have done NOTHING about it to date. 
 As I said before Says it all I think 😀

 Our diaries were stopped weeks ago, except the one they keep so you lose your evidence. Funny that they can't seem to find ones you already did, if you ask to refer back to them. I've seen for 2 months the staff throwing away the diaries of the people after they leave, without reading them or entering anything in the computer. Quite often this is immediately followed up by the staff selecting the person for an arbitrary Sanction, though they have done nothing wrong, just so the staff could meet their quota of people to kick off benefits. They laugh and openly boast to eachother about doing this. They even put down reason for the sanction in many cases as: 'failed to do the diary'. Of course, they threw the diary in the bin on purpose, or stuck it for a nice trip down the shredder. I've witnessed several whole days of this going on, having spent the days in the jobcentre. They didn't seem to know I overheard everything.

 What we need is a balanced approach to to the welfare system, someone in charge who has vast experience and common sense - any suggestions? 
 What we don't need is a jumped up little Hitler (IDS) who hasn't got any idea how hard it is to find a job and thinks paying Private Providers to fail and not even meet their contractual agreements with the DWP is a fantastic idea. 
 The Welfare system needs to be reset and fully reinstated to when Labour took over in 1997, at least it was doing what it was created to do back then, looking after the people who really needed it.

 I'm not writing with malice but in my opinion there isn't anything human that will help this gentleman. Those who have addictions, living on the street, lviving in the borderlands of unemployment/despair at least know they are fucked but this poor man lives in an unreal world and doesn't know that he is an far, far worse state that those whom he thinks he has the power to control and sort out their lives. If there is any good person with faith out there reading this then maybe give something up as a loving sacrifice with the wish that God will fire a dart of love into the hard hearted because it was the only thing that ever worked with me.

 That proves Universal Jobsnitch will be as useless or even counter-productive as the Work Programme has been. The best people to find work for the unemployed are the unemployed themselves, and outside intervention can only complicate matters and make already vulnerable people even worse off. But we know IDS will not budge from his mission to force ever more outside "help" on the unemployed, to the detriment of those affected.

 IDS has got bored of targetting the unemployed; he is now after the working poor too, working poor who were lead to believe by CamSham the Tories were on the side of "those who get up and go to work". Well Working Tax Credits are given to those very people, for whom WTCs make the difference between being able to live life at a minimal level of comfort while working, or being forced to quit their jobs altogether. IDS has no clue!!

 "Iain Duncan Smith’s own advisers have urged a softening of his benefits crackdown after hearing evidence that it risked pushing the poorest in society into “crime or prostitution”. 
 The work and pensions secretary should relax the punishment he plans to mete out to unemployed people judged unwilling to seek work, they warn. 
 Testimonies heard by the Social Security Advisory Committee (SSAC), a Whitehall body responsible for monitoring Duncan Smith’s planned welfare reforms, suggested that there is a danger of driving vulnerable families out of mainstream society. 
 The tougher sanctions regime was introduced in October. It is due to be continued under the universal credit scheme, the new catch-all benefit payment designed to simplify the system and make work pay. But the committee’s report told Duncan Smith he should offer some hope of state aid for those on the most severe sanctions. 
 In the most extreme cases the unemployed will lose their £71-a-week jobseeker’s allowance for up to three years if they are believed to have serially breached the tough new conditions for the universal credit, including the duty to attend job interviews, accept job offers or carry out unpaid work experience. 
 The committee recommended that those who are barred from payments but subsequently show a willingness to find work should have their benefits returned to avoid damaging outcomes. 
 The report’s authors wrote: “The higher-level sanction of three years drew a lot of comments from – and raised concern among – most respondents. Such a severe penalty could, they fear, result in claimants turning to the black economy, crime or prostitution, would not incentivise someone to enter employment, and would almost certainly damage children in a family where income is severely reduced for a prolonged period. 
 “US research was cited as evidence that severe conditionality can result in families becoming disconnected from society: they are neither in work nor receiving state support. Given the government focus on supporting families with children in their early years, respondents urged this level of sanction should be used with extreme caution. 
 “The committee is sympathetic to the concern expressed by respondents that if sanctions are to be effective in encouraging compliance, continuing a sanction beyond the point of re-engagement may well be counter-productive.” 
 Under the rules, where there are “low and intermediate level” issues, such as failure to actively look for or be available to work, claimants would lose their benefit for one month for the first offence and three months for subsequent events. 
 The higher level of sanction for people who refused a job or left one without good reason would be three months for the first time, six months the second time, and three years subsequently. 
 However, the SSAC cited international evidence that vulnerable claimants do not set out to be noncompliant but often led chaotic lifestyles, having poor organisational skills and frequently forgetting conditions they are supposed to fulfil. 
 “There is evidence from several countries that sanctions are experienced disproportionately by more disadvantaged and vulnerable claimants, those who are more socially deprived or isolated and longer-term benefit recipients,” it said.

 The disparity in the figures for employers is huge. Does this mean that a huge number of them are "inactive" employers? When those figures first came out figures for claimants who gave the DWP permission to view their accounts also came out. I wonder how many of those included in these figures have subsequently withdrawn their consent, having realised it is 
voluntary. 
 I know nothing about Kleenze. Are they commission only jobs or something?

 A person who has lost a limb/s still has a severe mobility problem. Let's take a soldier blown up by an IED for example. He or she goes through the rehab (the rehab available to personnel has by the way been seriously cut, in the Cuts), and manages to find somewhere to live that is not a box on the street! Probably they also have PTSD, anxiety, and the need to adjust to life with limb/s blown off. (They do still get NHS care, more than what kids blown up in Afghanistan get) [while we still HAVE an NHS anyway…] 
 Stuff about traumatic/surgical amputation. 
-Stumps can get infected and people need to keep the wound clean and avoid gangrene. 
-Often they have to take away more of the limb because of blast damage, comminuted fractures, embedded shrapnel, muscle and other damage. 
-Prostheses can't be worn 24/7. They have to be taken off at least some of the time, during which the person can rest but may be confined to a bed or wheelchair. 
-Prostheses can be painful and rub the stump, sometimes leading to pressure sores and infection. 
-Some types of prosthesis must be kept dry, depending on what they are made from. 
-Problems arise if the prosthesis does not fit or if the stump changes shape/size later (eg swelling from infection could make it impossible to put on the prosthesis, muscle wasting could make it too loose and unstable). 
-Even without infections or sores, putting on a prosthesis is uncomfortable to some people. Even the best types don't give 100% of the quality and performance of a normal limb. 
-Arms of the type that can be moved by nerve impulses, might only work on good days (worse if numb/cold). 
-Referred pain, pins and needles, and 'phantom limb' (feeling it is still there), and nightmares about it, can all happen. 
-If your mental state is affected then caring for yourself could suffer. Alcohol use reduces immunity and prolongs infections and the healing of sores. 
-Socially, there is stigma attached to seeing a person with a stump or seeing them remove a prosthetic limb. 
-Not all public transport is as accessible as before. 
-Loss, theft or damage of the prosthesis can reduce mobility instantly to zero. 
-Even with the best artificial legs, walking and using stairs have to be relearned to be done differently. 
-Carrying and lifting can be affected. 
-Most prosthetic arms do not permit the wearer to make movements requiring dexterity, such as writing, pressing buttons,picking up items. This can include the use of ATMs and phones. This is an obvious impairment to mobility. 
-If you have lost both arms, cleaning yourself and using the toilet are a problem. 
-If you have lost both legs, and are resting without the artificial legs, you may have to move by dragging yourself across the floor. 
-If you were a deaf civilian who lost your arms, you can no longer use sign language.

Whoever gets in is only interested in those they can put into part work/ part benefits to even reduce the benefit bill by half, and the rest can rely on food trusts or be forced out of their homes and denied their independence if they are over 55 years old and sick or unemployed, because there is very little chance of work for them to pay rent for extra bedrooms. 
older people are being shuffled into community homes or dwellings that are predominantly for older people, having little or no contact with the younger generation, why don't they just introduce euthanasia and be done with it, because they are being denied as are the young unemployed or disabled any quality of life.

 Yes exactly. I've had not one appropriate job sent either, and spam that has taken days to wade through. Not all mine were even in the UK. It's a laugh, as it says they are local jobs. 
 HSBC is the world's local bank or so it says. Which is why I moved to where, being disabled, I was 2 minutes from a branch. Soon after, they closed the branch, which is why they are the local bank?! It really dropped local elderly people in the brown stuff, as they are really more impaired in mobility. The other week an old lady took half an hour with a walking frame to travel ten metres by the post office opposite the former bank (I was waiting for my bus which took over an hour to arrive due to the cuts). The next branch of the bank is 2 miles and downhill. The concept of local seemingly involves relocation of the bank offices to a call centre in southeast Asia. A place I go quite often, a town an hour away by road, had a similar thing happen but on flatter terrain. But it was more of a scandal, as the smaller branch that closed was in a residential area entirely inhabited by pensioners, most of them extremely frail. The nearest branch is a couple of miles or more away. 
 'from Cornwall to Scotland' 
This is about right! Generally both in the same mailing. The system could be using a mad American system that thinks all parts of the UK are within driving distance of eachother, that the UK is tiny, that Scotland is part of North London; and that everyone lives in London anyway and wears a bowler hat, eats fish and chips, and talks like Dick Van Dyke. You know, the sort of satnavs that give the wrong route, and have even major cities like Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester in the wrong places. 
 What if you had the misfortune to be offered jobs at both and forced to jobshare, commuting between Cornwall and Scotland on more money per ticket than poor people pay in monthly rent.

 "Local Work Programme providers 
 Work Programme providers play a key part in working with DWP and Jobcentre Plus to help promote the support available through the Youth Contract to local employers and to identify suitable employment opportunities for participants. Where a wage incentive is appropriate, Work Programme providers will liaise with the employer, provide support and issue claims forms. 
 If you are an employer who is interested in employing an 18 to 24 year old with support from a wage incentive payment you should register your interest with local Work Programme providers. 
 The wage incentive is also available to employers through Jobcentre Plus if you take on an unemployed 18 to 24 year old who has been claiming benefit for 6 months.

 interserve , a work program provider has bought up a private health care company that looks after old old people.. or as interserve put it: 
 Interserve is planning to grow its health business, which reported revenues of more than £300m for last year, by broadening the services it delivers. 
 Advantage, which manages the care of 500 people, is part of a home healthcare market judged to be worth around £10bn. Analysts also believe public sector budget cuts should drive opportunities for outsourcing companies in this area. 
 Adrian Ringrose, chief executive of Interserve, said: “We see the healthcare and care at home sector as key growth markets and this acquisition both expands our capability, while also being a further step towards delivering the group’s medium term strategy of greater front-line service provision.” 
 Interserve had cash to spend after recently selling much of its PFI portfolio for around £124.5m, and placing the remainder with its own pension fund. Its argument was that while the assets generate a decent income, but sit better as an investment for pension funds than with itself. 
 Andy Brown, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, gave a ‘hold’ recommendation following the announcement, noting that Advantage will bring revenues of £41m and earnings of around £3m for the year. He said: “While the deal is accretive we are not changing forecasts as it offsets the profit lost from recent PFI transfers.” 
 so there you go..all our elderly people are well being looked after..NOT.

 DWP ‘hiding back-to-work fraud from taxpayers’, claims Margaret Hodge 
The Government has come under attack for refusing to publish details of more than 100 investigations into potential fraud in the back-to-work industry, claiming the cases are not in the “public interest”. 
 Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is “hiding” critical information from the taxpayer about the potential scale of wrongdoing across the sector and called on ministers to release the full details. 
 Since 2006, there have been 126 cases of potential fraud investigated in the welfare-to-work industry. Just 11 of these relate to crisis-hit A4e. 
 But after repeated requests for information, the DWP told The Telegraph it would not be disclosing details of the other 115 cases after deciding the “public interest” argument was not strong enough. 
 Of the total, 46 had a “case to answer” and were branded “non-compliance” or “false representations”, official documents show, suggesting the scale of the problem runs far deeper than A4e, which has faced several allegations about its conduct in recent months. 
 Figures show just five of the 126 cases are “ongoing”, with the rest “closed”. Mrs Hodge said: “The cases are 100pc in the public interest. More and more of taxpayers’ money is being used to fund private sector companies delivering public sector services.” 
 The allegations led to A4e founder, Emma Harrison, resigning as chairman in February. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing on her part. 
 THERE IS NO SUGGESTION OF ANY WRONGDOING ON HER PART.. 
oh ha ha ha..of course not none at all..why should we think so???

 CYNICAL IAIN DRUNKEN SHIT…. 
 http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jan/02/iain-duncan-smith-polemic-politics-cynical 
 "An interesting division has opened up recently that, for brevity, we can call "toff Tories" versus "all the others". The Blue Collar Conservative movement was set up by Carlisle activist Clark Vasey, with the intention of giving Tory candidates a chance in seats outside the south-east. One third of Tory MPs have already signed up to its core beliefs, though how much that differs from clicking "Like" on Facebook, I don't know. That core consists of a simple message: the Conservative vote doesn't have to narrow down to rich people and those who think they will become rich. It can appeal to regular, modestly paid people, but only if it shows some awareness of the cost of living, and accepts that just because you're claiming benefits – in or out of work – it doesn't mean you're scum. These two principles, two and a half years ago, would have seemed self-evident, the kind of anodyne statement that politicians sometimes make to keep their face moving in a slow conversation. Nowadays, it actually counts as a sticking point for this radically unpleasant party." 
The architect of this kind of thinking – that the poor are kept so by state handouts, and if only they were left to sink, they would find it in themselves to swim – is, of course, Iain Duncan Smith. Possibly trying to create some diversion around the impending disaster of the universal credit, he wrote a column about in-work benefits at the weekend, blaming Labour's payments to supplement working families' income for the fact that public finances are "at breaking point". 
"Funnily enough, I agree with him in the first instance – it isn't the job of government to supplement low wages, which in effect subsidises corporate super-profits. Labour should have tackled child poverty by insisting on a living wage and taking seriously the perils of an economy that was increasingly built on low wages. 
 But there we part, IDS and I, because he attributes the problem to in-work benefit "fraudsters". This is another move that would once have seemed bizarre but is now a cliche – a system is deemed "unaffordable", the culprits are identified as a small core of liars, but since the unaffordability, by their terms, outstrips the dishonesty by such a huge margin, we are left to make the tacit leap that really, all of them are committing fraud. The very act of receiving money from the state constitutes a fraud. Amusingly, in Duncan Smith's article, they're not just fraudsters, they're foreign fraudsters – a piece of baroque nastiness ungrounded in any evidence. The number of foreigners claiming tax credits has never been calculated by the Department for Work and Pensions."

 How correct you are chewie that business should not be subsidized by government handouts in the form of tax credits for those on low or part time wages, especially as it is only bringing claimants up to the minimum wage not a living wage and is responsible for the term strivers and skivers, workers and shirkers etc, with those who consider themselves to be strivers attacking those who are unemployed, with a little help from government propaganda and their own ignorance.

 Clark Vasey: 
Is he from the village of Royston Vasey in 'The League of Gentlemen'? ('This is a local shop for local people') Related to the 'probably brother and sister' pigfaced married couple (wife is called Tubbs), who run the shop and kill all nonlocal people? Or he could be related to that butcher guy who chops up all the bodies and sells the meat. Yeah I know they are fictional characters but then so are the tories (I wish.,..), they are caricatures but so are the tories and even without trying. Another possibility is that he's related to Pauline from the job club. 
 Just a point about Pauline. She is meant to be created as a joke, a warning, an 'ogre' figure. The job club sketches appear to have been watched end to end by the DWP and treated as a training video. If they could deify Pauline they would. I imagine them building shrines to her, on a par with the Virgin Mary. 
Some of Pauline's tasks included ones set by Hayley Taylor later at Ar$E 
(okay A4E). The one where you are treated like you are 5 years old and they ask you what you want to be. Where you want your life to go. And they give a chunky big marker on a flipchart, and you have to draw a road. 
They pick points helpfully labelled 'you now' and 'where you want to be'. 
Would honesty require you to answer, Me in the future: kicking your corpse? Pauline thinks her job club people are in love with her (Pauline is in love with a female ex-colleague), actually they despise her. In one episode Hayley (I mean Pauline - it's so easy to confuse them!) is doing another pointless task, and the most intelligent jobseeker there says he wants to go because he has a job interview. Pauline says no, won't let him go, and threatens to stop his benefits. She says he has to be there and do the stupid activity. In the final episode Pauline says he is getting his benefit stopped. He gets up and reveals he is her undercover boss, gathering evidence on the horrible way she treats the jobseekers. He sacks her and she cries. 
Out of all the schemes so far A4E and Serco have been the closest to Pauline's way of working. The patronising-then-menacing voice. The endless infantilising activities (no I don't want to draw a road). The frequent threats of loss of benefits for noncompliance. The way she boasts about having a job even when it's pointed out to her the sole purpose of that job is wrecking people's lives and aiming to leave them destitute. 
By the way Pauline has a face like the back end of a bulldog. Hayley Taylor merely resembles a bulldog chewing a wasp.

Local councils especially labour run councils, should be attacked like the charities, for not only doing central governments bidding but restricting the board structures to a couple of tenants who are elderly and not affected by housing issues themselves, there should be homeless people on the boards of social housing also. Nothing in the public sector runs democratically especially staff recruitment.

 They are pretty well paid for these shitty jobs in most cases - what about the shitty jobs the unemployed are forced to do for zilch?
