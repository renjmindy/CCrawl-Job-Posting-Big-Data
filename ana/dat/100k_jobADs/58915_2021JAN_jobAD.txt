 Second VA Job Payment 
 Been very busy this past few days because I was working on a new project for the same employer that paid me for the Facebook Researcher job. After slaving  lol  nonstop for 2 days, submitted my work and got paid instantly. Here's the payment proof: 
 
 The job was to link the client's info in 100 Directories, submit an article to 50 Article Directories, and create 40 Social Bookmarking accounts. I thought it was just an easy job, but it wasn't, that's why I spent 2 days just to finish this. Funny how this job can literally complicate my other online tasks, but I'm happy. 
 Things are getting better in terms of online opportunities, hope more jobs to come. 
 NOTE: Some areas are highlighted because those are my private info (Name,Address,Tax ID# etc) and of the employer. 
 The payment is supposed to be Php900 but less 2% BIR Tax and Paypal Transaction fees.

 You mentioned of 2% tax imposed by BIR. Is this something which is collected by Paypal as an agent ? Hmmmâ€¦I never know about this tax thing because last year everything in Paypal is tax freeâ€¦

 Not Paypal, Tom, but by the employer, as this is a local job. But Paypal deducts a transaction fee for the conversion to Pesos. ðŸ™‚

 I wonder why they're deducting taxes from your earnings. I'm guessing it's because they have to report it as part of their expenses, right? 
 By the way, just wanted to let you knowâ€¦ 
I WON FIRST PRIZE!! I won the Apple iPad! Woohoo!! ðŸ™‚

 Yes sis. Since local sya they have to follow the rules. Also they need the TIN so they can report it cguro. Anyway, 2% lang naman deduct nila. What bothers me is the transaction fee, khit maliit lang, it's still deducted to my earnings. 
Congrats sis!
