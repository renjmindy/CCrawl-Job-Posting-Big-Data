 What do you like about your job? 
 Stuart Young, London, UK 
 Hiya, 
 Take the opportunity today to consider your job and find three things youâ€™re happy with. 
 1. I'm quitting soon,  or  2. the toilets are clean, etc. - do NOT count! ðŸ™‚ 
 I understand this might be difficult for some. Try it though and see if you can â€˜honestlyâ€™ find three things that you are happy with about your job. 
 This could be the start of you appreciating it for what it is. We've all heard the grass is greener right? Maybe if you stopped looking at what is 'wrong' with your job - just for today, you might find there's a lot you actually like. 
 It must start with you, all of your happiness, contentedness, peacefulness etc. comes from the way you think about your circumstances. 
 If you get to the end of today and you really have struggled to find 3 things you like - you need to read my new eBook: "  Do You Hate Your Job?  ". It's not very long, but it is laser focussed on helping you understand what you must do next. 
 
 Grab a copy now at NO COST, if not for you then for someone you know thatâ€™s struggling to get out of bed every work day. 
 Click here to get your copy . 
 Enjoy 
 Stu
