 Learn About Criminal Justice, Public Safety Careers At Biennial Event‏ 
 
 
 
 Blue Bell, Pa.—  Montgomery County Community College (MCCC) will host its 16th Biennial Criminal Justice and Public Safety Career Day on Tuesday, April 19, from 8:30 a.m.-2:30 p.m. The event will be held at the College’s Central Campus in Blue Bell. 
 The event kicks off at 8:30 a.m. with a ceremony on the front steps of College Hall. During the ceremony, Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele will present a “Medal of Valor” to a recipient from the law enforcement community. Recipients of this prestigious award are selected by the Police Chiefs’ Association of Montgomery County. 
 Following the ceremony, the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Career Day begins at 9 a.m. More than 50 organizations will participate, including representatives from municipal, county, state and federal law enforcement agencies. Employers and exhibitors from the private security sector, emergency medical response, the fire service and area emergency management agencies will also be on hand, as will representatives from area colleges and universities that offer transfer programs in law enforcement and public safety fields. 
 “The College’s Criminal Justice and Public Safety Career Day directly serves the career interests of our students and also strengthens the relationship between Montgomery County Community College and the public safety community,” shared Benn Prybutok, MCCC’s director of protective services. 
 Exhibits will be stationed in the lobbies of Parkhouse Hall and the Advanced Technology Center, as well as the outdoor quad area, weather permitting. MCCC’s Central Campus is located at 340 DeKalb Pike, Blue Bell. 
 The event is free of charge and is open to the public. Students from area high schools, as well as area colleges and universities, are encouraged to attend. For information, call 215-641-6428 or email bprybuto@mc3.edu.
