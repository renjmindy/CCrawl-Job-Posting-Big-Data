 Stuck In A Career Rut? Forge The Way Ahead With Lessons From Dr. Suess. 
 2/2/2016

 He wasn't a business guru but Dr. Seuss sure knew a bit about motivation, as demonstrated in one of his most prolific (and sadly last) works "Oh, The Places You'll Go!" 
 The story focuses on you, the reader and the trials and tribulations you may come across on your way to moving your own personal mountain. It teaches us that motivation from within is the only thing that can keep us going through the challenges we may face on our journey to following our dream, beginning with: 
 Congratulations!   Today is your day.  You're off to Great Places! You're off and away!

If it's always been your passion to start your own business or you're looking to change career and start afresh, but you feel stuck in a rut, convinced you can't move or make change, or can't think how or what to do next, these four simple lessons to be learnt from Dr. Seuss will help you forge the way ahead.  I promise your only regret will be you haven't done it sooner! 
 
 Be bold.  Start today - right now. You have the resources within you to help you achieve your dream. 
 ​  Believe in yourself   and that good things will happen if you make educated decisions on which direction you should take. Sometimes you might need help in decision making. Asking for directions is not weakness. 
 **Set yourself small, achievable goals.  **Some days, you will feel on top of the world, others, you'll feel like you're wading through treacle. You  _will  _procrastinate because your goal seems so overwhelmingly large, looming in the distance. Simply by putting one foot in front of the other you will reach your destination. 
 Face your fears with your eyes on the prize.   There will be times you feel lonely and afraid but nothing is more motivating than a compelling positive image. Stay focused on the reward at the end of your journey. 
 
 So...be your name Buxbaum or Bixby or Bray  or Mordecai Ali Van Allen O'Shea, You're off the Great Places! Today is your day! Your mountain is waiting. So...get on your way!
