 Campground Jobs Are In Luxurious RV Resorts and In Rustic, Primitive Camps 
 Campground jobs cut expenses and can pay bills. They're likely the first thing that comes to mind when you think of working while camping or RVing. There are volunteer work camper and paid positions. 
 Imagine your favorite campground.... 
 Do you see a luxurious resort? A five-star RV park with all the amenities? Large spacious RV sites with concrete pads and neatly groomed grass? A spa with a gym and swimming pool? A recreation hall with activities, classes, and entertainment? 
 Or, do you see rustic camping accommodations in state parks, national forests, and primitive camps? Do you see hiking trails or fishing lakes? Perhaps wildlife, wild flowers, and nature all around your campsite? 
 Campgrounds fit both ideals and everything in between. And, they all need workers! They all have things that they need help with, that you can do while enjoying camping and RVing the way you like to do it. 
 Volunteer work campers (also known as workcampers or workampers) receive free RV and tent camp sites and other perks. The work is typically at state and national campgrounds, city and county parks, and other recreational facilities owned by the government. 
 Working campers at private campgrounds sometimes trade or barter. They work in exchange for a site, often with utilities, and other benefits. According to IRS regulations, these work-for-site trades are not volunteer jobs. 
 More exciting though, many camp and RV park owners now pay their workers for the jobs they do! While volunteer work camping is still popular in public campgrounds, private campgrounds and RV parks are now more often treating working RVers as regular, paid employees. 
 Just as there is much diversity in camping facilities, there is much diversity in campground jobs. Camp hosting is sometimes used as a catch-all term, however, it usually means cleaning. Some RVers work in the park store or office. Some, typically men, do maintenance around the campground and work on outdoor projects. (That is not a sexist comment, but a fact.) Some teach classes to other RVers or lead activities. RV parks, and especially resorts, hire cooks, as well as workers for serving and doing clean-up. Helping the park design its site maps, while done at the campground, is a contract job that includes selling advertising. Entertaining other campers can be part of a campground job or by an RVing entrepreneur. Other self-employed RVers sell things at the campground flea market -- and they sometimes hire other RVers to help time. Repairing RVs is another line of work that done at campgrounds by a self-employed RVers. 
 Some camp jobs are even more diverse and exciting! Participate in a buffalo round-up. Be on the look-out for wild fires. Gather campers for a chuck wagon dinner. 
 Some camp jobs let you pursue your personal interests or learn new skills. Give interpretive talks. Build birdhouses. Do native landscaping. Share what you know with other campers. 
 Some campground jobs are laid back and relaxing, giving you the chance to be part of the campground family. Other campground jobs are demanding and require specific skills, and the pay compensates you handsomely. They are as varied as the RVers who do them.
