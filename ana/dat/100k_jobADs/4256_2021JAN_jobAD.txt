 About Vena Vitals

We've shown that it works in the operating room and is as accurate as the best tools doctors have today, at a fraction of the cost. We're a team of health tech scientists with multiple past startups and exits, and we've built products that have scaled to over 2M users.

 About Us 
 Vena Vitals is on a mission to transform patient care through better cardiovascular monitoring. We make a small wearable device that monitors blood pressure continuously. Unlike other BP monitors that only take a snapshot in time, we record the entire dynamic movie to track changes that can be life-saving. We have strong early clinical results, and we’re now expanding our clinical studies across multiple sites around the country. From the operating room to the home, we plan to become the most accurate and actionable cardiovascular monitoring and management system to help improve the lives of over a billion patients across the world each year.
