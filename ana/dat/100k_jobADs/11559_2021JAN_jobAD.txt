  5 Job Skills in Demand in 2011  
 Heather Huhman 
 February 18, 2011 
 This article lists five types of job skills in demand  in 2011 - plus a bonus!  Depending on your industry, certain skills are bound to trump others. But overall, what are employers looking for in an ideal candidate? According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) Job Outlook 2011 survey, employers are looking for job candidates these top five skills and qualities: 
 
 Verbal communication skills 
 Strong work ethic 
 Teamwork skills 
 Analytical skills 
 Initiative 
 
 Skill #1: Verbal communication skills  In the workplace, you need to be able to clearly and concisely communicate with co-workers, clients and supervisors. This is an important skill and is often evaluated based upon your initial interview with the hiring manager.  Skill #2: Strong work ethic  An employer is looking for a candidate who is reliable, takes initiative, and works hard. You need to show that you can work independently, arrive on time and fulfill your commitments in order to be perceived as having a strong work ethic. It’s also important to strive for quality work—employers want someone who can do the job right the first time.  Skill #3: Teamwork skills  The ability to work in a group effectively is key to success on any job. It’s likely that, at some point, you’ll need to work with others in order to get a project done. You need to possess solid communication skills (including listening) and the ability to speak knowledgably while also maintaining a commitment to the team and voicing your opinion.  Skill #4: Analytical skills  You should possess the ability to visualize, articulate, and solve complex problems and concepts. Analytical skills include the ability to use logic and design and test solutions to problems. This also encompasses formulating plans to solve problems.  Skill #5: Initiative  The definition of initiative is the readiness and ability to take action. Although some things may not be in your job description, it’s important to convey your passion for the organization and its success by offering expertise on new projects or volunteering for tasks that interest you.  Skill #6: Emotional intelligence (BONUS!)  Another highly sought after skill or quality in candidates is emotional intelligence. This can be defined as the measure of one’s ability to understand and deal with their own emotions, the emotions of others and how to properly act on those emotions. Emotional intelligence can be broken down into several categories: social skills, social awareness, self-awareness, and self-management. How can you improve upon these skills in demand?
