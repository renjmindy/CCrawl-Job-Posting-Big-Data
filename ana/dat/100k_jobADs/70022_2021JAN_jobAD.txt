 It doesn't mean anything without context. Where did you see this phrase?

 The price of success is hard work, dedication to the job at hand, and the determination that whether we win or lose, we have applied the best of ourselves to the task at hand. 
I don`t understand correct meaning of this quote.

 Do you understand the meaning of "at hand"? It's a phrase that means "close by" or "relevant." To succeed you must be dedicated to the job you are doing.

 The quote appears on twitter:

 "The pieces of success is hard work, dedication job at hand, and the determination that what whether we win or lose, we applied our best."

 Quite frankly, that tweet has so many errors in it that I have little idea what is meant. 
 I would guess at "The elements of success are hard work, dedication to the job in hand, and to be able to say that you gave your best, whether you won or lost." 
 Lombard may be a good football player, but his English is appalling.

 Kassidy copied the quote incorrectly, XinJinXiang correctly. Vince Lombardi (he was a coach, not a player) was very good with words, but perhaps not so much in this instance.
