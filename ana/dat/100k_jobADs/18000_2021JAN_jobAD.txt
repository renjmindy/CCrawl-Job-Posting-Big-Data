 Got questions? We have answers 
 We do job costing by phase. Is this possible in WorkflowMax? 
 If you want to group your job costing by phase only at the job level, you can use job folders. 
 When quoting, make use of job templates to create your quote. On your job template you can create default folders. Save the template header and then add your milestones, tasks and cost, selecting the appropriate default folder for each item. 
 Then, when you create your quote, all you need to do is select the first phase template and then within the quote choose Options > Apply additional templates. 
 Otherwise it's not possible to directly group tasks and cost items by phase at the quote stage.  Contact us  for more advice. 
 In my business we sometimes need more than one quote on a job. Is this possible in WorkflowMax? 
 Yes it is but you can only have one 'master quote' on a job. For example, if you created multiple quotes on a job, only the latest accepted quote would be referred to when creating an invoice based on the quoted value. 
 Can I run a job financial report for dates in the past? 
 Yes you can. Run the report from the financial reports menu and simply select the client and date. If you run it from the 'Financial' tab on the job however, it will show you the entire summary for that job.
