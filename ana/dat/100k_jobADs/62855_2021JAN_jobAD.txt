 Background 
 2020 was a year like no other. In August 2020, the number of individuals on zero-hour employment contracts in the UK reached 1 million for the first time. Since then, this number has continued to increase. More people than ever are looking for and completing temporary work. As a result, our team has been building a mobile application which provides a platform where individuals seeking temporary employment can connect with businesses in London. This is where you come in. 
 The Role 
 We are currently looking to expand our core team by recruiting an Android developer. You will be responsible for the enhancement of features of this mobile application over the coming months. These include, but are not limited to, user profiles, push notifications and automatic emails. The vision is to pitch for private investment in the summer and pay salaries following this. Subsequently, at the moment company shares would be offered in exchange for your time developing this mobile application. 
 Summary 
 Overall, we believe this is a great opportunity for someone wanting to be part of a high-growth potential technology company from the beginning. Having spoken to many individuals and businesses over the past few months about our idea, we believe this is an exciting business opportunity. We look forward to hearing from you.
