  Job Search: Fitting in is Failing  
 Corey Harlock 
 July 25, 2011 
 It is easier to get hired for your ideal job than it is to just get a job – regardless of the economy or how many jobs there are or aren't. And the reason you can't get hired is because you don't know what your ideal job is! You can't tell me what it is you truly love and what to do. You can't tell me what environment you want to work in. You can't tell me how you want or don't want to be managed. Where you are on your own personal experience cycle. And most importantly you can't tell me the real reason you are going to work! But…that is not your fault, because everything you have ever been taught, read or heard about finding a job is wrong! One of my favorite quotes is from Seth Godin in a book he wrote called  Purple Cow .  Purple Cow  is a sales and marketing book. But isn't a  job search  really all about sales and marketing? Aren't you really marketing and selling the most amazing product you have ever seen – yourself! In  Purple Cow  , Seth Godin wrote: 
 “In a crowded market place fitting in is failing and in a busy market place not standing out is the same as being invisible." 
 
 Fitting in is failing! Not standing out is the same as being invisible! Think about that for just one second. Everything you have learned about finding a job has taught you how to fit in – or fail. How to not stand out or be invisible. So, do you want to change that?  Corey Harlock, founder of Skills to Achieve, is on a mission, teaching job seekers how to be Inspired to Get Hired! Corey created the Fearless Job Seeker System to teach everyone what only a few job seekers know — about how to Promote Yourself and get hired.  _ ****_
