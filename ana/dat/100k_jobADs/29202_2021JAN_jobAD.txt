 The awaited 'Promotion'= a distant dream? Are you sure you really want it??? 
 Posted on  April 16, 2013  by   AryaaAkshay 
 There can be such a big world inside of us & we may be completely unaware of it!! 
No wonder why Coaches are such a necessity today ðŸ™‚ 
 Everyone of us, may think we know everything about our life but the truth is far off! We may think we want that promotion but may be the thought of that extra responsibility or spending more time at work is pulling us away.. 
 Do we know for ourselves, what is it that we exactly want? Do we really want that promotion? 
 What is it about your work that attracts you to it? 
 ~ The opportunity to help others 
~ Opportunity to specialise in your field 
~ The possibility of making relationships beautiful for you and others around you 
~ Growth aspects /learning and growth opportunities 
~ Supporting others in creating & overcoming challenges to lead a more fulfilling n challenging life 
~ Making money for yourself and others.. 
 The list could be long.. Could it be that your career is just a milestone in your life n not the entire journey? 
Where as many of our peers here are looking at stability, there could be many who want something more.. 
 May be we already have what we want! Yet we look at those who have stability and wonder if something's wrong with us? 
 Money, status, stability, property could be must have's for some people! For some others the thrill of moving, travelling, learning, constantly changing could be a must have!! 
 There's nothing wrong with changing careers or changing places or making moves constantly!! Making sure, your family (and most importantly your spouse) understands your need for change - it definitely is a 'must do' 
 Knowing what one wants - clearly & then going a step forward to communicating the same with important people in your life is very important for peace and happiness to prevail in your home ðŸ™‚ 
 Can you pause for a minute & think for yourself, where are you fitting into this right now? 
And please take few more minutes to share with us your story!! 
 Love
