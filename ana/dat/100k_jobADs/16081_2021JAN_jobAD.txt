  What's Up With College Career Centers? Tell Us YOUR Experience  
 Work It Daily 
 March 19, 2009 
 By J.T. O'Donnell Recently, I held a focus group with 12 college students - juniors and seniors. The discussion was around their experiences with college career centers...and it was fascinating. I'm not kidding. Today, college grads are getting two gut-punching realities thrown at them. They are: 1) leaving college with lots of debt and a piece of paper that doesn't differentiate them the way they were told it would. 2) finding out quickly that they are uneducated on how to successfully launch a career. In fact, you regularly find us saying in our blog posts at Careerealism.com, "College teaches you everything EXCEPT how to get the job." Yet, many people blame students for the latter.  "Students don't take advantage of all the resources our center has to offer,"  is what I have had more than a few campus counselors tell me. And yes, there are PLENTY of Blutarskis (see photo) going through the motions and leaving school with nothing more than 4 years of fuzzy memories. But, the students in my focus group weren't those kinds of slackers. There were high-achievers who hadn't graduated yet, which made their reasons for criticizing their career centers that much more insightful. So, this got me thinking....what has everyone else's experience been with their career center? Is there more to this story?  Which led to this:  our first  CAREEREALISM survey .  It's simple (10 questions) and quick (2 minutes tops) to complete. We are looking to get at least 1000 people to take this survey and then we'll be posting the results. That means we need your help! We'd be grateful if you'd  CLICK HERE and complete our survey. Don't worry, it's anonymous, so you can be as honest as you want. (Seriously, we want details!) Thanks for helping us break the story wide open. Okay, so I realize this isn't a super intriguing for most of you, but for all of us at Careerealism.com, this is very important data. We'll be using it to help improve the quality of our own resources so we can help all the students who don't have strong career centers. I thank you in advance for helping us.  CLICK TO START NOW...
