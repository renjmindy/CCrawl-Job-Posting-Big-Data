 Job 25 
 1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 
 2 Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places. 
 3 Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise? 
 4 How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman? 
 5 Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight. 
 6 How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is a worm?

 25 1-6 Bildad the Shuhite again attacked Job: 
 “God is sovereign, God is fearsome— 
everything in the cosmos fits and works in his plan. 
Can anyone count his angel armies? 
Is there any place where his light doesn’t shine? 
How can a mere mortal presume to stand up to God? 
How can an ordinary person pretend to be guiltless? 
Why, even the moon has its flaws, 
even the stars aren’t perfect in God’s eyes, 
So how much less, plain men and women— 
slugs and maggots by comparison!” - MSG 
 "Can anyone count His angel armies?" This is why we do not need to fear the adversary. There are angel armies that daily fight for us and for the people of this region. Let us go out into this region with great confidence in God that He will war on our behalf and His angels will war for us as well.

God is almighty and all powerful, he rules and reins, there is nobody like our God! We must wake up and understand that we serve a mighty God! Once we get that we will not worry, doubt or fear but instead we will rest assured that we are in control.

 Sometimes we allow fear to take control of our lives. We know that God is in control and is all powerful, but we believe for others more than we believe for ourselves. Yes we are nothing but with God on our side we can do anything! 
 God is fighting for us, pushing back the darkness, lighting up the kingdom, that cannot be shaken, In the Name of Jesus enemies defeated….

 The resources of our GREAT GOD are endless. We are wise to never underestimate his influence, power or knowledge. No matter the situation or circumstance GOD is ABLE and the POWER of HIS name JESUS controls every dimension of space, time and matter. 
 If GOD be for us, who can stand against us. If GOD be against us, who can stand with us.

 Job 25:4, "How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?" 
 Justify is to declare righteous; to make one right with God. 
The question is, "How can man be declared righteous or made right with God, and how can he be clean?" 
 Through faith in God and the Plan of Salvation. Repentance, Baptism in JESUS name, and infilling of the Holy Ghost. 
 1 Cor. 6:11, "And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God."

We must praise him and give reverence to him. He is the Almighty, everlasting, eternal Father of us all. He loves his children. Wow. Thank you Jesus for everything you have gone for me.

 How then can man be justified with God? 
 I will pray every day. I will return my tithes; first. I will give sacrificially of my time, talent’s and treasures. I will do all things in the name above all names; Jesus. 
 This will earn me entrance into Heaven. 
 It is sad to say a great number of people believe this is what it takes. Ephesians 2:8-9 “For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.” Our works do matter to God. We must never think of them as a means to earn our salvation. Good works come as a response to God’s grace and mercy. We don't have to get it all right to be in a relationship with God. We don't have to be perfect; we can’t. 
 We are not saved by works. We are saved for works. That is to say, we are saved for the purpose of doing good works which glorify God. Our works don’t get us to heaven but our works follow us there. Consider James 2:26 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also. We can also not allow ourselves to believe that doing good works today releases us for the rest of our lives; once saved – always saved. 
 Matthew 7:13-14 “Don’t look for shortcuts to God. The market is flooded with surefire, easygoing formulas for a successful life that can be practiced in your spare time. Don’t fall for that stuff, even though crowds of people do. The way to life—to God!—is vigorous and requires total attention.”

 We cannot comprehend the knowledge and power of our God. He has dominion over all things great and small. "Let go, and let God." This used to be a quote in old Pentecostal churches of my youth. If we allow God to be in control of our lives than He will lead and guide. If we submit to His rule over us then our wildest dreams will line up with His dreams for us.

 Yes, this is a true statement, no one is innocent before God. We are born into sin from women. We have to know how to save ourselves, and protect ourselves from the enemy. We can only live a holy life, and hope on judgement day, God will have grace upon you, and allow you to enter his kingdom.

“God is more glorious than the moon; he shines brighter than the stars.” 
‭‭Job‬ ‭25:5‬ ‭NLT‬‬ 
 God is more glorious than the moon… 
Jehovah God is greater than Allah. 
 The evidence reveals that the temple of the Moon-god was active even in the Christian era. Evidence gathered from both North and South Arabia demonstrate that Moon-god worship was clearly active even in Muhammad's day and was still the dominant cult. According to numerous inscriptions, while the name of the Moon-god was Sin, his title was al-ilah, i.e. "the deity," meaning that he was the chief or high god among the gods. As Coon pointed out, "The god Il or Ilah was originally a phase of the Moon God." The Moon-god was called al- ilah, i.e. the god, which was shortened to Allah in pre-Islamic times. The pagan Arabs even used Allah in the names they gave to their children. For example, both Muhammad's father and uncle had Allah as part of their names.

 This is just another case when God created the heavens and the earth he did everything for a reason! He outshines everything and everyone! He is the light that is pure and ricteous! We need to believe in what he is doing. Temptation will come our way… but our eyes need to stayed glued to our focus. Our whole life is about growing, and we only know so little about him and his abilities.

 Verse 2 AMP “Dominion and awe belong to God; He establishes peace and order in His high places." Luke 10:18-20 MSG says "Jesus said, “I know. I saw Satan fall, a bolt of lightning out of the sky. See what I’ve given you? Safe passage as you walk on snakes and scorpions, and protection from every assault of the Enemy. No one can put a hand on you. All the same, the great triumph is not in your authority over evil, but in God’s authority over you and presence with you. Not what you do for God but what God does for you—that’s the agenda for rejoicing.” Same verses in the AMP "He said to them, “I watched Satan fall from heaven like [a flash of] lightning. Listen carefully: I have given you authority [that you now possess] to tread on [a]serpents and scorpions, and [the ability to exercise authority] over all the power of the enemy (Satan); and nothing will [in any way] harm you. Nevertheless do not rejoice at this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven.”

 What a comparison. Although no one is perfect, and all of us deserve nothing less than a sinners death, God loves us. He knows what we are made of, he knows our flaws, but he still chooses to call us friends. A real friend is like God, full of compassion and quick to forgive. We would be wise to take these things to God in prayer instead of boldly prosecuting each other. God is the only true judge because he knows the whole story.

6.How much less so a human, who is a mere worm- The offspring of humanity, who is a maggot! The Voice 
 Someone born of a woman in blood can be pure because He went to the cross and shed His blood which covers all sin and iniquity. 
 Alas! and did my Savior bleed And did my Sovereign die? Would He devote that sacred head For such a worm as I? 
 At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light, And the burden of my heart rolled away, It was there by faith I received my sight, And now I am happy all the day!

We don't deserve his mercy, grace or love but when we walk with him faithfully he calls us righteous. Only Jesus can make us pure by washing us with his blood. When God is with us no one can stand against us.

 God does not give us a spirt of fear 2 Tim 1-7. The spirit he speaks of is out of a humbled respectful heart for we are to exalt him for his greatness. Bildad is saying that God is Omnipotent all powerful and has all dominion for through him all things exist for he is Omnipresent. In Him is his presence of peace.

 All power and dominion belong to God. His armies are bigger, greater, stronger. There is none that can stand before him. And aside all of this, He is our heavenly Father. Build a relationship with the Father that you may have rest and peace because you will know that the Lord of angel armies is on your side. The psalmist said on chapter 27; the Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?

 Yes Bildad is right that we are all just nothing in the sight of God, but one thing that he didn't understand was that Job really was living right. Many times people try to justify out what is happening in someone else's life. It's NOT our place. Our place is to show the love of Christ by being a friend. Our job is to love. Our job would not be to blame our friends for their troubles.

 2 Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places. 
 As children of the Most High, we are able to take dominion over the powers of darkness and cast them down through the power and authority of God working through us. Because of what Jesus has done, we are righteous before Him, we can come boldly before His throne, we are given all things pertaining to life and godliness, and we are empowered to become partakers in His divine nature. We are children of God, our names are written in His book of life, yet we sometimes forget what it means to be His children. It can be easy to lose focus of who we are when we look at the frailty of mankind and our own failings, for what could man be before God? How could man be clean before Him? How could man be righteous before God? If we cannot find truly redeeming value within ourselves in this flesh, can we stand in the surety of faith concerning our identity in God? When we remember who He is and what He has done, we can. We are not simply children of men standing before God, we are children of God standing among men during this present season. When we remember how great and mighty He is, we have an answer for the questions presented in these verses. Because He is, so can I now be. His blood covers my sin, His righteousness upon my ledger, and He stands as my Advocate and Justifier, who has given me grace so that I might partake of eternal life in Him. I am His child, transformed and made new, wholly beloved and the apple of His eye.
