 January 07, 2012 
 When we launched CAREEREALISM.com three years ago, the goal was to do our best to help Americans deal with the reality, “Every Job is Temporary.” We started by finding great, proven career experts and showcasing their timely advice. Then, we adopted the first weekly,  free webinar series  as a way a way to give professionals a means to interact with these experts and learn from them using the latest technology. Now, I’m happy to announce we are offering yet another cutting-edge opportunity for the readers of our site: Career Mania 2012!  Our Experts Are Offering You Exclusive Opportunities to Advance Your Career!  The week of January 23, many of our CAREEREALISM-Approved Career Experts will be offering you some timely advice in the form of a brief video. Each short tutorial will also have a special offer embedded in it, giving you the chance to take advantage of the special offer they are only making available to our readers. To be sure you get access to  Career Mania 2012 , I suggest you drop your e-mail in below.  If you cannot see the sign-up area, please e-mail our staff at help@workitdaily.com .

 Offers Will Be Limited in Quantity and Time  Because these offers are so good, the experts will be limiting the number of people who can take advantage of them. So, I encourage you to review their offers as soon as we send them to you, as the best ones will be snapped up quickly! Don’t spend another year in a dead-end, demotivating career situation. Get the help you need to make your professional goals a reality. If you sign up for Career Mania 2012, you’ll be taking a big step towards getting the right coaching for success!  J.T. O’Donnell  is the founder of CAREEREALISM.com and CEO of  CareerHMO.com , a web-based career development company.   Business woman pointing her finger image  from Shutterstock
