 You will be leading the charge on building a greenfield project as a core pillar of our growth strategy 
 Role overview 
 Tailwind  is a 50-person tech company growing quickly ‚Äî roughly doubling in size year over year. Our visual marketing software is loved by nearly 400,000 small businesses, brands, solopreneurs, and influencers who use it to take their efforts to new heights on Instagram and Pinterest. 
 We have a big mission too:  Make world-class marketing easy for everyone.  And we‚Äôre looking for a senior mobile engineer to help us achieve it faster.  You‚Äôll be creating brand new features on a newly released application in a React Native environment; your experience in releasing successful apps is going to be invaluable as we level up our mobile development. 
 What you‚Äôll love about this role: 
 
 You will be leading the charge on building a greenfield project that exists as a core pillar of our growth strategy for 2020. 
 You‚Äôll be building products small business owners use daily, helping them to pursue their dreams and thrive financially using our platform. This is an opportunity to have a major impact on the trajectory of our company, as well as millions of small businesses around the world who will come to benefit from our products. 
 You will have the opportunity to mentor and work alongside a growing team of mobile engineers on new applications from the very beginning. 
 You‚Äôll be architecting a mobile tool that small business owners use daily, helping them to pursue their dreams and thrive financially using our platform. 
 You‚Äôll play an active role in the entire development process  ‚Äî  from planning, designing, architecting, coding to implementation and documentation! 
 You‚Äôll have the freedom and support to challenge yourself with difficult problems without being afraid of failing, with opportunities to learn from mistakes. 
 Our engineering team is a collaborative group of programmers who want to learn from you and help you learn! We are looking for someone who can level up our mobile development by bringing new ideas to the table and sharing your knowledge with our current team. 
 You‚Äôll dive into our modern tech stack and toolkit, and start shipping code on day one; immediately influencing the direction of the product, the team, and the company in a big way. 
 We‚Äôre nimble and fast-moving, without corporate red tape, approval layers, or politics. 
 You‚Äôll get ownership shares, company-paid insurance premiums and extremely competitive benefits package, salary refreshes twice a year with annual bonuses and an unlimited vacation policy. 
 
 About you: 
 
 You‚Äôre able to work in our Oklahoma City or New York City office once the offices reopen. 
 App creation experience:  You have experience building best-in-class Android/iOS apps and you have deployed them to the Google Play/App Store - the value you can contribute to the team is much more important to us than years of experience or titles. 
 Full-cycle know-how:  You are familiar with architecting new applications through maintaining them long-term. Your knowledge of this process will help guide our decision-making as we are creating our new applications. 
 Mobile know-how:  As an engineer fully dedicated to Mobile - you have the experience to operate autonomously while also sharing knowledge with our current team. 
 Agility and Iteration:  You are comfortable working in an agile development environment, where requirements and goals might rapidly evolve as we listen to and learn from our users. 
 Ownership:  You are eager to take the reins of our mobile development process and work with our product team to create a cohesive mobile Tailwind experience. Your experience with mobile development will be able to guide and influence product decisions. 
 Team-wide communication:  You are eager to work with the product team, marketing and customer success to understand our members, the problems we are solving and sharing the solutions. 
 Problem-solving: You are comfortable working on ambiguous problems and designing/creating solutions for unique and challenging problems. 
 
 Our technology stack: 
 You‚Äôll need to have production experience with at least some of our technologies, frameworks, and languages. Or at a minimum -- similar ones that will help you learn and start contributing quickly. 
 
 Mobile: React Native 
 Front-end: Javascript (React), Sass, Bootstrap, Foundation 
 Back-end: PHP 7, Laravel, Beanstalk, Memcached 
 Testing: XCode Test, JUnit, Espresso, UI Automator, Tape, Enzyme 
 Database: MariaDB, TokuDB 
 Version Control: GitHub 
 CICD: CircleCI 
 DevOps: ELK (ElasticSearch, LogStash, Kibana), New Relic, Indicative Analytics 
 Dev Tools: Docker local environment, Rust CLI productivity tools 
 IDEs: VSCode, PHPStorm 
 Hosting: Rackspace (dedicated + virtual servers + CDN), AWS (cloud instances + CDN) 
 Agile Communication: Clubhouse, Slack, and Github 
 
 Bonus points for experience with: 
 
 Handling large volumes (Terabytes) of data 
 Creating and scaling web APIs (RESTful, MVC) 
 Product Design / UX experience 
 Active Open Source contributions 
 Languages: Rust, Kotlin, Go 
 No-SQL databases (Cassandra, MongoDB, RedShift, etc.) 
 Strong Dev-Ops tools (logging, monitoring, cloud provisioning) chops 
 Big Data stack (Hadoop, MapReduce, Hive, HBase, Pig) 
 Data Science, Machine Learning: scikit-learn, Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, etc 
 
 This position must be based in our Oklahoma City office or our New York City office once it is safe to return to work. 
 NOTE:  Please don‚Äôt talk yourself out of applying if you don‚Äôt ‚Äúcheck all the boxes.‚Äù We support each other‚Äôs growth and celebrate our differences at Tailwind. If you‚Äôre passionate about growing successful teams and hiring, feel free to apply. We‚Äôd love to hear from you. 
 More about us: 
 
 We are all owners (literally): We take responsibility, don‚Äôt pass blame, and don‚Äôt rest until the problem is solved 
 We're growing quickly ‚Äì roughly doubling year on year ‚Äì and we're  profitable 
 We set audacious goals and tackle challenges daily, which leaves no room for ego or a sense of entitlement 
 We‚Äôre multi-office: Most of our team members work in our headquarters in Oklahoma City, while many of us call our New York City office home, and a few of us work remotely 
 We‚Äôre radically transparent: Sharing new ideas and plans, giving feedback, and making everyone feel welcome in every conversation 
 Our growing team blends deep early stage DNA (team + alumni have started 17 companies, and helped build 18 other startups) with industry expertise born out of leading names in tech and marketing such as Google, YouTube, AOL, AWeber, a la mode, BigWing Interactive, Paycom, Apple, Yodle and PCI 
 We believe our industry‚Äôs lack of diversity hurts us all and work hard to foster a company culture that‚Äôs inclusive and appreciative of everyone‚Äôs talent, authenticity, and ideas ‚Äî regardless of our differences
