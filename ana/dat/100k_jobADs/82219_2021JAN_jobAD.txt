 Jul  16 
 While Sandra Beck takes a short family get-away, host Robin Boyd will be joined this week by  Marcella Stretch  of PODS - Parents of Deployed Service Members. Marcella is a frequent guest of Military Mom Talk Radio and founder of the growing Facebook group, PODS. Glad you could be with us, Marcella! 
 
 Lt. Col. and Mrs. Adam Boyd 
 Kristen Boyd  has been a military wife for almost 18 years and has traveled with her husband, Lt. Col. Adam Boyd, during their entire marriage. Raising two children while being stationed out of the country has challenges, but also opens up some wonderful opportunies. Kristen has been a welcomed resource to new miliary wives facing moves and has made settling into new areas much easier because she's been-there-done-that! 
 The Veteran and Military Business Owners Association, VAMBOA  , is a non-profit veteran business trade association that promotes and assists Veteran Business Owners, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Businesses (SDVOB) and Military Business Owners. We know that you possess special skills including leadership abilities and a work ethic second to none. Veteran Business Owners, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Businesses (SDVOB) and Military Business Owners are highly qualified to build successful businesses. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and responsible for job generation. 
 “People from the military have wonderful qualities that lend themselves to entrepreneurship,” said Debbie Gregory, one of the co-chairs and founders of VAMBOA. She said veterans and active military personnel who own businesses needed an organization that could help them get information, collaborate with each other, and grow through connections with government agencies and private businesses that want to use their goods and services. 
 There were 2.4 million veterans who owned businesses in the United States in 2007, the Census Bureau reports. Those businesses had receipts totaling $1.2 trillion. California had 9.8 percent of the nation’s veteran-owned businesses.

 John L. Rothdiener  's home is nestled in the Missouri Ozarks, in the town of Bolivar. The author has had a lifelong passion for writing. Over the years, he has written many short stories and newspaper articles. The Quest for Forgiveness is his third novel and the first in his Quest series. His ideas have been conceived in dreams, which he firmly believes are inspired by God. Each novel pierces the soul, often encouraging the reader through difficulties and trials they are facing in their own lives. Each person holds that spark of hope for a better place…a better life…and a better tomorrow. Rothdiener desires for his books to help the reader in a quest, searching for life 's answers. 
 The Quest for Forgiveness will take the reader into the life of a flawed young girl as she transforms into a superstar. The story puts you into the life of the rich and famous and gives you understanding that they are just like you and me.

 Feb  22 
 I had the priviledge and pleasure of attending the Camp Pendleton Career Expo on February 7th. This job fair was informative, exciting and very well attended. The main point I picked up from all the representatives of the companies and educational institutions was that everyone wants to help our military brothers and sisters! This will be a regularly updated blog as I receive new positive leads for all of you. Check out these companies and educational institutions below. And when you contact them, tell the contacts you heard about their career information from Military Mom Talk Radio!
