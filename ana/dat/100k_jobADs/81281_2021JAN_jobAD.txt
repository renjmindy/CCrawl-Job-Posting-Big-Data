  #1 Reason You Hate Job Search (It’s The Same Reason You Hated Zumba)  
 Ariella Coombs 
 November 28, 2014 
 You hate job search. There isn’t one thing you like about it. But why? Hint: It's the same reason you hated Zumba at first.  Related:   3 Tips For Landing A 'Perfect Fit' Job  Here’s the thing: when you're learning something new, it can be frustrating because you don't know everything and probably feel a little foolish. But, if you stick with it, it can be hugely rewarding. Think about the first time you road a bike. It was scary. You didn’t know how to balance yourself. And you certainly didn’t know how to keep yourself upright for more than three seconds. But you stuck with it, even after struggling, and you eventually built up enough skill to kick off those training wheels and have dad let go of the handle bars. You got it, eventually. You just needed practice. Now, think about your first time trying Zumba. You were so excited when you first got on the floor. But were you able to keep up with the class? Did you get all the steps the first time? Did it come easy to you? (If it did, I’m super jealous.) For many people, it takes at least three sessions to start getting the hang of it. But, you have to endure a few embarrassing moments before you can get to that point. If you give up before you get there, you’ll never learn. And even worse, you’ll never enjoy it. (In fact, you might even become one of those people who hate Zumba solely because you weren't amazing at it the first time. What a shame!) Job search isn't something most of us are used to doing. It's not something we do on a weekly basis. We weren’t taught to do it in school. We never got a chance to hone our skills. We just have to go out there and wing it – and sometimes winging it can be frustrating. That's why job search can feel impossible sometimes. Because, like learning anything new, it’s hard at first. You don’t know all of the answers. You don’t know how to do everything right the first time. It takes practice. So, just remember that next time you want to throw your computer out the window. You’re learning. Instead of quitting, find help. Here are three things you can do to improve:  Identify your weak areas.  Figure out where you’re struggling and look for resources that will help you strengthen those areas. There are plenty of resources available that help with interviewing, cover letters, resumes, and so on.  Here are a few career resources we offer.   Get a career coach.  You’ve been coached your entire life – from learning how to ride a bike to learning how to play football to learning how to do math. Your career is a big part of your life (in fact, you spend about a third of your life working), why wouldn’t you get a coach for that?  Check out CareerHMO.com for virtual career coaching services.   Practice each day.  Don’t avoid your job search responsibilities because you don’t enjoy them. Practice makes perfect. Make yourself a plan and stick with it.  Check out this article to help you get started.  I know it's hard to hear, but if you want to find a great job, there aren't any shortcuts. Sitting on the computer staring at job postings all day and blindly sending out resumes won’t do you any good. You need to learn how to job search effectively and efficiently. Now, go out there, learn how to job search, and get the job you want!
