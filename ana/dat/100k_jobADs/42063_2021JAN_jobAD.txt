  Are These Companies Unethical?  
 Work It Daily 
 May 15, 2009 
 Dear Experts, Many companies ended up "rescinded and/or deferring" offers to interns/co-ops and full-time job candidates. Now, less than 6 months later (less than 1 month for some) they are starting to line-up recruiting activities on-campus and advertise jobs for next year's candidates. What should be the reaction of the campus career centers? The Colleges of graduates/students that were affected? From the students at the campuses themselves? I've heard about everything, but haven't seen anything "outlined and executed" yet.  Here is how the T.A.P. experts answered on Twitter:   @beneubanks   Q#124  Can't say what reaction "should be." I'd get the word out about the unethical activities. Word of mouth is very powerful.  @kgrantcareers   Q#124  Sorry, it's "just the way it goes". Stick 2 plan. Market self 4 positions as if all these things hadn't happened B4.  @juliaerickson   Q#124  Career office can tell students how company operated as fair warning so they can apply more than 1 place.  @sweetcareers   Q#124  Here is a A NACE Position Statement on Rescinded/Deferred Employment Offers:  http://is.gd/AfDy   @DebraWheatman   Q# 124  Life isn't fair. You fell victim to a rough economy. Reapply and explain that you were extended an offer previously.  @jtodonnell   Q#124  Re-apply to company who is hiring on campus. You are an alum - so you can go to the job fair & wow them!  @jtodonnell   Q#124  At  CAREEREALISM .com we say, "EVERY Job is Temporary." Expect companies to offer & rescind, it's reality.  @dawnbugni   Q#124  It serves no one to hold to a grudge. Good exposure to need 4 "eyes wide open" informed job research 4 all.
