 The rise of the flexible 9 to 5 
 Over the past couple of years there has been a shift in the rigidity of the 9-5. At the same time there has also been a rise in flexible payed per task jobs, think Uber and Deliveroo where you're payed for every passenger journey or meal delivered. 
 I feel like so much has changed in society over the past 10-15 years that it is clear that the old ways of the 9 to 5 have no real place in today's society. 
 As someone who works a 9-5 below are some of the changes I've noticed. 
 No desk 
Companies are switching to agile working where employees don't have a set space to work, instead you have a locker where you keep your belongings and you 'hot desk' instead. Read my 'Hot desk diary' for an insight into my experience. 
 Not quite 9 to 5 
Working hours are becoming more flexible where starting an hour earlier or later dependent on what suits you is encouraged as long as you complete your weekly hours 
 **Working from home  ** 
Many people's office jobs can be done from anywhere at least 80% of the time and the remaining balance can be sorted over the phone. For anyone with a long commute, working from home can end up saving you a lot of time. 
 These new ways of working are creating a shift in office culture. Or more so that that these changes are a way for office culture to catch up with how the world is evolving.
