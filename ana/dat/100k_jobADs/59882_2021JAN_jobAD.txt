 Book Review: Jon Acuff on Loving Your Job Anyways 
 Posted on  July 28, 2016  by   B 
 I was feeling a little bit sorry for myself the other day until I read Jon Acuff's  Do Over . 
 No, it didn't make me feel better; at least, not at first. It made me bawl my eyes out. 
 Even though  Do Over  is the only business book to evoke such an emotional response from me, I didn't enjoy it just for the catharsis it provided me. It's a fresh perspective on why we work the kinds of jobs that we do, and the choices that we make in the workplace that can advance (or destroy) our careers. 
 Acuff argues that as a society we're trained to find jobs instead of pursuing careers. Gone are the days when people found a "good job" and stayed in the same position for twenty-five years. Nowadays it's common to switch careers up to three times throughout your working life. 
 So why this sudden shift? 
 Things like job security and health benefits are still important to most people. But in a world with a growing population and a fluctuating economy, these "good jobs" are fewer and far between. We're living longer, too, and becoming more educated, so the competition for these jobs is higher. Many are forced to adopt a lower standard or accept a less than ideal position in order to remain employed. 
 Although much of  Do Over  is about giving your career a fresh start, what made it so poignant for me was the empathy Acuff expresses for his readers who feel frustrated and stuck in their current positions. And then he gives those readers a swift kick in the pants. It's our attitudes that are the problem, he explains. No one ever got to exactly where they wanted without hard work and sacrifice. Sometimes it's about making the best of an opportunity. Through befriending co-workers, finding mentors and developing new skills, you can take what you've learned in your current job and adapt it to any future situation, so you can finally start heading in the direction that you want to go. 
 Is it a challenge? Yes. Is it impossible? No. 
 And that's kind of why the book got me in the feels- we've all been in situation where we feel stuck, bored or dissatisfied in our jobs. Yes, the purpose of a job is to make money, but there's a lot to be said for enjoying yourself (even just a little) in the place where you spend most of your waking hours. 
 Don't forget, there could be benefits to your job as well besides the money- a great relationship with your co-workers, a sense of autonomy, or a chance to be creative may be the reason you choose to stay in a position, or the reason why you chose a position in the first place. 
 Even if you're not looking to make a major career change, I'd still recommend  Do Over  as a good read after a bad work day, or a bad work week, or if you're simply just frustrated and in the mood for some wallowing. Acuff's writing is snappy and humorous but at the end of the day it's the catharsis I experienced after finishing it that makes  Do Over  such a good read.

 This is one of my favorite books, too! I was lucky enough to meet Jon Acuff last year when he was promoting this book. It was held in a small bookstore and he took the time to allow quite a few people share their dreams of the businesses they are trying to work toward or create. He told the audience the one rule he had was that no one was to roll their eyes or laugh at the dreams of the people sharing. It was great! I highly recommend you see him if he comes to your area :)

 Oh wow, what a nice guy. That's so great that you got to meet him in person! This is the first book of his that I've read and I'm looking forward to picking him more. I'm glad to have found another Acuff fan. Thanks for sharing your story, Pam.
