 Agent Finds Joy in Her Job 
 __ 
 Filed under:  WooHoo! Crew 
 Sonya  | Agent since 2012 
More than 10 years of customer service in the healthcare, retail, financial services, and travel and hospitality industries. 
 Laughing Her Way to Success 
 Sonya joined Working Solutions in 2012 as a contract agent, working client programs in the healthcare, retail, and travel and hospitality industries. 
 When dealing with tough clients or unbelievable situations, she laughs to herself about the absurdity of it all. Humor is a pressure valve, enabling her to release built-up tensions. 
 While she can appreciate the comical, she’s all business when it comes to service. 
 Do What You Do Best 
 Sonya joined Working Solutions in 2012 as a contract center agent, performing client programs in the healthcare, retail, and travel and hospitality industries. 
 Not all of her assignments have worked out to her liking. As she says, “You have to realize what your strengths are and aren’t. And then put those strengths to work.”

 To that end, she moved on to a position of strength, now booking reservations for luxury vacation properties. 
 Though somewhat new in her role, the client already has recognized her for her high number of bookings. 
 Work with the Best 
 She credits her leadership for the success. “Management is my family. They helped me through difficult personal situations, encouraging me to put myself first. They gave me the time off from work I needed to take care of myself.” 
 Even in those times, she kept her sense of humor, finding something to chuckle over. 
 Before Working Solutions, Sonya attended college and worked several years for a collection agency, where she was a background-and-referral specialist. 
 After posting her resume on LinkedIn, she got a call from Working Solutions. As the interviews began, Sonya did her homework, checking the background of company founder Kim Houlne. Sonya learned what Kim was all about, taking inspiration from what she did to build her company. 
 Love What You Do 
 “I love Working Solutions. There’s no better company. They allow you to be yourself and bring out the best in you.” 
 Sonya readily admits she loves to make people laugh and that others say “she’s a hoot, and can sell you anything.” 
 “I’d rather make people laugh than give them a gift. In fact, laughter is the perfect gift. Because gifts wear out, break or go into the trash. But you can make a lasting connection so long as you can make somebody laugh.” 
 Serving the Public Servant 
 When Sonya first started working as a tier 2 agent for a major travel company, she had no idea that one of her first customers would be an elected official. 
 But that’s what happened when she got a call for a reservation at a private estate and retreat. The customer wasted no time in telling Sonya his position, wanting the reservation handled discreetly. 
 “I gathered my thoughts, used my active listening skills and heard my manager saying: ‘Sonya, you got this. Take a deep breath.’” 
 Sonya looked up the official on Google as he was speaking to find out more about him and where he was from. 
 Translating Customer Needs 
 “After he was done, which seemed like forever, I asked for permission to put him on hold. I then called the hotel and got in touch with the manager. 
 “I told her I had an official who wanted to deal with one person only. Although he didn’t literally say this, I knew that’s what he wanted.” 
 After Sonya communicated all his “wants, needs and desires,” the hotel manager assured her she would take care of everything. 
 Sonya got back on the line with him to confirm the booking and his point of contact at the hotel. “Perfect,” he replied. 
 “Before we hung up, he thanked me for my ‘outstanding customer service’ and said he was ‘very happy.’ Being new on the assignment, that meant a lot to me.”
