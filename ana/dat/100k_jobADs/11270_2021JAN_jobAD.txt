 One Panther Rewind: Cam’s 15th Career Game-Winning Drive Stuns Vikings 
 In one of the most competitive games of the 2017 NFL season, the Carolina Panthers upset the Minnesota Vikings in Charlotte, 31-24. 
 The Vikings, who entered the game an NFC-best 10-2, rallied late in the fourth quarter from a two possession deficit to tie the game. In this video—the difference in the game emerges—a remarkable run in space by Cam Newton followed by running back Jonathan Stewart’s third touchdown of the game, a career high.
